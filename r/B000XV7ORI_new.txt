5	1405123200	It's a very good nursing bra.
5	1405123200	This is the best nursing bra. My son is now six months old, and I have three of these. Super comfortable, and very easy to nurse in. The only downside is that if you need to wear heavy nursing pads in your bra, the outline is a little visible through your shirt. I switch to underwire molded cups when I go to work or dress up. But this bra is the only one I wear when I'm home, awake and sleeping, and running errands. It's super comfortable and looks good.
5	1405036800	Excellent for postpartum wear. Very convenient and comfortable.
5	1405036800	Love this bra. Very comfortable but supportive.
5	1405036800	Great nursing bra! So comfy to wear and supportive. It actually supports my chest as I'm on the well endowed side and worried about support without an underwire. Love that it can be converted into a regular bra with the given attachment hooks!
4	1405036800	So comfortable.. I'm normally a 36 D and large was perfect
5	1405036800	Very comfortable!! Some other nursing bras provide so much coverage that you can't wear your old tank tops or v-neck shirts without your bra showing, but that isn't the case with this one. It provides enough coverage without looking like your grandma's bra.
5	1405036800	Super glad I found this bra. I had trouble locating a nursing bra in my size and this one fit great!
5	1404950400	These are by far my favorite nursing bras.  I got one from Target, the Gilligan and O'Malley; and it got ratty looking in a month.  Then I ordered these, and the quality is beyond comparison.  Most comfortable bra I own.
5	1404950400	I have yet to try this while nursing since I am still pregnant, but it is one of the most comfortable bras I've ever had. I like that it can convert to a regular bra when you are done with nursing. The removable pads really help conceal the nippleage without being too bulky :)
2	1404864000	I was a 36D pre-pregnancy and have found that the coverage of the bra isn't enough for someone my size.  There isn't much support and the internal strap that the hook is on (not sure how to describe it) gets stretched out very fast and then provides no support. I have a Cake bra that I love and would choose that one over this.
5	1404864000	Awesome nursing bra. I need to get another one because I wear it every day.
4	1404864000	Very comfortable and useful. A bit small but going to keep anyways. No wires and very soft. Supportive too.
5	1404864000	comfortable
5	1404864000	Fits great, got this bra based on so done else's recommendation and am glad I did.
5	1404777600	Just perfect !Perfect Fit , look and feel
4	1404777600	Bought this based on all the positive reviews. I found it to be too small and too spandex-y. Still, best nursing bra I've ever used.
3	1404691200	I ordered the small since typically im a 34A but my breast have grown a bit to what seem like a B cup, but this was too small i think and i put it on for the day and the material made my breast sweat.  Im not sure how i feel about it, maybe if the size was right id be happier but it definitely seems to run small.  I was going to return but i didnt want to have to pay for the return cost and the hassle of going to the post office so im keeping the product, but i do think i overpayed for a product im not 100% satisfied with.
5	1404691200	extremely comfortable and ultra supportive.  my boobs look like they're in an underwire bra and are totally perky, which is hard to do with nursing boobs!  believe the hype.  this bra is the bomb.  i just wish it was a little cheaper so i could buy one in every color :)
5	1404604800	Wore this almost everyday when breastfeeding. So comfortable and good quality (stood up to frequent machine washing on delicate cycle). Can make into regular bra once done with breastfeeding (Genius!)
5	1404604800	This bra is extremely comfortable and fits well!!!!
5	1404518400	Super good. Very convenient
5	1404518400	very comfortable & much cheaper than in my country
4	1404432000	Larger than its size
5	1404432000	I got to the point where my regular bras were uncomfortable. I was searching for a comfy bra that didn't look like a sports bra under shirts & could also serve as a nursing bra later. This bra is exactly what I wanted. I can't say how it serves as a nursing bra yet, but it is definitely my favorite pregnancy bra.
5	1404432000	I love that this includes the foam pad, provides great padding and coverage when you really want it.
5	1404345600	: )
3	1404259200	The pads are wrinkled and it shows through the clothes.I'll wear it in the house, more like a nigth bra because of that.
5	1404172800	it fited me perfectly,before pregnant i wear 34B,now i wear 36B,i choose M
5	1404172800	It fit as described. It is comfortable and is great for use during pregnancy and after. I like having the option to remove the pads if I want to. The straps are comfy and the bra holds up well.
5	1404086400	These bras are a cross b/t a sports bra and a regular bra. Super comfortable, especially in those early days of breastfeeding (BF) where you are a bit sore and engorged! I ordered a few different bras to try out and these were by far the most comfortable. They aren't sexy, but not awful either. The cup liners are flattering and create a seamless silhouette, can wear w/ t-shirts or tanks no problem. I have been wearing them now for 3 mod since I gave birth...have no desire to go back to underwire bras! (BTW underwire bras can cause blocked ducts (that can lead to mastitis) so beware..it happened to me in one afternoon. I was able to unclog it b/f it got bad.)An added bonus, they also come w/ a converter 'kit' to remove the BF latch, for when you are no longer BF and want to continue to use them. ;)I've already recommended these to 2 of my girlfriends who are pregnant.
5	1404000000	This product fits and feels wonderful!  What a relief to find something I can wear all day! I plan to purchase another!
5	1403913600	Last night I tried it on, and I found it so confortable and soft that I just slept with it. I liked the fit, the material, but not the pads very much, with out them the bra is great. I'll get them in more colours.
4	1403913600	Comfortable bra. I ended up buying a medium but as my body size continues to change decide to get a large to see if it fits better.
5	1403913600	I bought a small one, the overall size is good and it feels fantastic, but the cup is a little bit large for me. Considering buying one more if necessary.
5	1403827200	Every woman should have one of these Bras! It was very comfortable and still is! I intend to use it beyond my period of nursing because it is so comfortable. Very easy to wash. Even after three months of constant, daily use, it is still comfortable and shapely.
4	1403827200	This bra is very comfy and fits true to size.  I'm currently 9  months pregnant, about a 38C and 5'5&#34;, 190lb.  I think that once the baby is here and I'm closer to my normal size (34C, 145lb), it will still fit well.  My only call out on this bra is the height of the cups.  I do not wear revealing clothing, but I found that even with my normal V-neck shirts, this bra is exposed at the top of the V.  It's annoying but not horrible; I just have to wear a different bra when wearing those shirts, or pin it so that it doesn't pop up.
5	1403827200	Quality is great. It's evident when comparing to less expensive brands ie target. There is a removable pad insert. This is the only bra I can wear outside because of the insert. I just wish it'd go on sale sometime so I can purchase more.
5	1403740800	Great nursing bra, so comfortable, and love the easy sizing. Don't even feel it on when I sleep at night
4	1403740800	The product is comfy and does what it says but the price is crazy. I would rather of not paid so much. My boobs got even bigger during breast feeding so I wish I would have ordered the Large instead of Medium. My breasts are 36 D. I may be in between sizing. Who knows. You can sleep in it too and there are washable removable Pads as well.
5	1403740800	This is the beat nursing bra. I've been using motherhood maternity brand sincepregnancy but their bras are very uncomfortable and dig into my ribs . The support for this bra is just right (I'm a 38d) and the straps clip down easily for nursing. I will be using it both around the house and back to work.
5	1403654400	Between Medela Nursing, Motherhood Maternity and other cheapies... Bravado has the BEST fit, comfort, and utlity. LOVE this bra. Got it when I was pregnant in 3rd trimester, and it is my favorite bra now 3 weeks post-partum. So comfry and its adjustable so it gives support as my milk flow is regulating. Soft and comfy to sleep in without feeling like you're restricted. And the colors are cute.Highly recommended!
3	1403568000	This is a great bra for sleeping but it doesn't provide enough support for a day to day bra. If your boobs are large like mine, I wear a 38 C to D, this bra does not make them look firm.
5	1403568000	I've bought a couple different nursing bras but this is my favorite. Soft, comfortable, stretchy, and good shape. I don't use the removable cups in there, and use my own breast pads. This bra is worth every penny!
3	1403568000	This bra is not incredibly supportive/flattering but it is very utilitarian for nursing. Easy to snap and release with one hand, the pads are very absorbent with leakage and its a soft material that you can even sleep in. A little overpriced.
5	1403481600	My daughter just had a baby and was having trouble with the bras she had  purchased while pregnant and a friend had told her about this bra.  It literally is lived in when you are a nursing Mom.  She loves this bra and it is very comfortable day and night!
5	1403481600	Comfortable and suprisingly flattering. I actually ordered two more today and recommended them to other new moms. Get yourself one!
5	1403481600	I love this bra! It fits perfectly and feels great! I just bought another one in a different color. After trying on a bunch of nursing bras in stores, this one is the best by far. Very happy!
4	1403481600	It is a nice bra and everything is as expected. Like it. I haven't been able to use it yet so only give it 4 star.
5	1403481600	color was as expected, my wife feels great on the body, especially practical and fast to feed the baby when you are not home
4	1403481600	I was hoping to find a comfortable nursing bra with an underwire as I'm fairly large chested (36E) and require support. No such luck...this was the second in a string of bras that I purchased and I've found this: Either they're comfortable or they provide support, there is no in-between in the world of nursing bras. This is extremely comfortable, fits kind of like a t-shirt bra and I'd never wear it to work...I love wearing it everywhere else though and my son loves not having to fight a ginormous stiff sup to get his meal so this is my favorite bra of the lot ;)
5	1403481600	This is my wife's review:Very good support! The material is elastic enough for your movement and gives room for your growing breast.It won't move even I do stretching. It also gives your body a good shape: It won't flatten my breast at all. I don't feel I'm wearing a nursing bra. Even it's quite expensive, I will never regret to buy this. Absolutely worth it!
3	1403395200	I really shopped around a lot before I ordered this, and was somewhat disappointed. . It has strange aspects and certainly doesn't make your bust look like pictured. I ended up going to a maternity store and actually getting fitted.
5	1403395200	I love this bra! I wasn't sure which bra to buy, so I read the reviews and decided on this one. I'm so happy I did! It is so comfortable. It fits perfect.
5	1403222400	Only nursing bra I have ever owned, but I love it. Super comfy and easy to use.  Be sure to wash it in a garment bag though because the foam pads will fall out from time to time in the laundry!
4	1403222400	This bra fits great! I'm a 34 DD and got a size M.  I got this while I was pregnant cause I couldn't find a good fitting bra and this worked great!  There are 4 settings to adjust the circumference of the bra which is helpful.  As I wear it I find I have to make it tighter and tighter.  I do feel like it's not that great of a lift after a couple days of wear but washing it resets it.  I don't dry my bras in the dryer either.  Amazon had the best price for this bra.
5	1403136000	Excellent fit and support. I highly recommend this product. I took it with me to the hospital and I still use it for nursing. Provides excellent comfort and support by day and if soft and comfortable enough to sleep in. Has great construction and integrity for snapping on and off for feedings.
5	1403136000	I like how the Body Silk Seamless Bra fits better, the front V is still low enough to go with all of my shirts and it doesn't cut into my boobs like the wrap style of the original nursing bra. I still like and will use the original nursing bra (size S+) when I get back closer to my original size (34C), but I'm hopeful that this one will get me through the rest of the pregnancy. Medium was a way better fit for where I am right now (30 weeks).
5	1403049600	Definitely worth the money.  This nursing bra fits great and is super comfortable.  It's easy to snap and unsnap with one hand.  I ended up buying 3 that's how awesome they are.
5	1402963200	I'm currently nursing daughter #2, and love these bras.  I have three right now, and believe me - they are well worth the money you will shell out for them.  They're extremely comfortable, and I like that they're supportive without having underwire. They're easy to use and adjust, as well.  They come with pads that are removeable; I like this because I wear the disposable breast pads and the padding hids everything quite well.  I highly recommend these to any nursing mama!
5	1402963200	I'm a first time mom with a large bust. The Bravado Body Silk Seamless Nursing Bras are super comfy and easy to nurse in. They don't give the same profile as non-nursing bras, but it is the most uplifting and supportive nursing bra I've found.
4	1402876800	nice nursing bra with pads, real nice soft material, great color, fit as expected if you compare your size to sizing chart.
1	1402876800	I ask for Large size and I receive a XL size :-(I live in Brazil, so... what can I do know???
5	1402876800	I got one of these bras during pregnancy and got 3 more postpartum. There is enough stretch to accommodate changing bust size, but the elastic is stiff enough to provide good support. The insert pads provide a lot of helpful, ahem, contouring, and they can absorb a lot of excess milk in a pinch. These bras are very comfortable and have a nice smooth silhouette under clothes.
5	1402790400	I've nursed four babies and didn't find this bra until the last one; however, my search for a comfortable and practical nursing bra is over.  I will recommend this bra to everyone.
4	1402704000	I like a lot about this bra.  The clasp is great for easy access.  Easy to hookup for hands free pumping!  The only bad thing I feel about this product is that there I only one panel all the way across.  Once I pull down one side to start breastfeeding, I feel like my other breast is falling out and it is hard to control all of that.
5	1402617600	Great nursing bra. I love it! Soft, fit as expected, and easy to unhook with one hand. I'm gonna buy more.
5	1402617600	This bra is superior to all other nursing bras I've tried on.  As a large-breasted woman, I was nervous about buying a nursing bra that would not only fit and allow room for growth, but also function properly.  This bra does all three in spades.  Not only that, but it quickly became my most comfortable bra in the drawer. It looks great under any shirt, thin tee shirts included, and it does not bunch up or roll down any area...it stays put comfortably. I 100% recommend this product.
5	1402531200	I bought this bra when my 1st was born. I've tried many of their bras and this is my absolute favorite. Its a very healthy bra too as it does not have an underwire and allows movement to help with lymph flow. When I'm NOT nursing am a 32DD/32E- I have ALWAYS had to deal with very expensive uncomfortable bras. When I was prego I went all the way up to a 34H  : (  When my milk came in I looked like Dolly Parton. Anyway, these are the MOST comfortable bras I have ever worn- EVER! True they aren't the sexiest, and if you have a very low cut shirt (I mean pretty darn low) then the bra will show. I've got these in my &#34;nursing&#34; size and my not nursing size- My husband loves the way my breasts look in these bras- full, natural, supported yet very very comfy. These are the Perfect T-Shirt Bra. I really can't say enough about these bras! I will say my only pet peeve is how the pad/liner comes out every time in the wash- but thats really no biggie.I've been washing mine Cold wash, Gentle Dryer (in a delicate bag for both) for 4 years, and I only wear two of this style and two of the Bliss- which is not my favorite but ok occasionally. They are really only worn on the clasp. Drying them makes the band tighten up again so they don't over &#34;stretch&#34; like regular bras do.Worth every penny. If you're not happy, I'd suggest contacting the company or trying a different size.
5	1402531200	It is the best fitting nursig bra in my opinion, specially if you have big breasts. I bought other brands and they don't fit and accommodate half as well as this one. Very comfortable.
4	1402531200	This is a very comfortable bra.  I'm a 38DD right now.  It has great form under shirts.  The pads fit well in the bra.  The cup size also fits well, but it's a little snug around the back clips.  I had to use the last loops, which means I cannot get any wider.  Fingers crossed.
5	1402358400	Fits comfortably, even for sleeping, and looks great (after taking out the pads as recommended by other reviewers)!  Worth the extra money.
4	1402358400	This bra is really comfortable and provides a decent amount of support. It's clearly not a push-up bra but there is no underwire so one shouldn't expect it to be.
5	1402358400	This bra is so comfortable the only thing I regret was not buying two off the bat so I could rotate them in my laundry cycle. I have purchased other nursing bras that are racerback style and they tend to hurt my neck.I was a 34C before baby and am now a 36D (borderline DD) and I purchased the medium. It fits perfectly and does not show any lumpy back fat :-)The only thing that is kind of annoying is that the clip where the bra hooks in the front is fairly high up so when trying to fasten it with one hand in a hurry, it can be a little difficult. But the comfort far outweighs any minor inconvenience.
4	1402272000	Haven't used it much yet, but it seems to fit nicely and be comfortable. I'm curious to learn more about the convertibility piece.
5	1402272000	Nursing bras are a must if you're planning to breast feed. This is a great nursing bra and I recommend this bra to every pregnant and/or nursing mama I know. They are super comfy and have amazing support. I continue to wear these even though I quit breast feeding 4 months ago. A+ Bravado for producing this bra.
5	1402272000	I have two of them, one in nude and one in black.  Love the fit and comfort of them.  I do have to wear an undershirt with lower cut shirts but that's ok.
5	1402272000	Feels like a soft sports bra (minus the racerback), but gives you better shape.My last bra was a 36DD and the Large fits me well. I also feel like it has some stretch to it to accommodate more growth as I get closer to end of pregnancy. I'm 29 weeks now, but underwire bras are no longer comfortable.
5	1402185600	So comfortable and supportive--love it! I use it under nursing tanks or on its own. Took out the cup liners as they didn't fit well.
5	1402185600	I have this bra in small, medium and large. It is super comfy and it is the only bra I could wear in pregnancy. I have continued to wear it for nursing. It is easy to open and close.
5	1402099200	Comfortable and great fit. Exactly what I was hoping for. I am wearing it at 8 months pregnant and plan on using it throughout nursing.
5	1402012800	Very comfortable, definitely worth the money. Fits perfectly for those of us who are full- busted and gives more support than most other maternity bras.
5	1402012800	It's expensive but I like it. You can easily tusk nursing pad in it. washed and dried in machine and doesn't distort.
4	1402012800	It fits very well and had nice coverage...it's easy to use while nursing....and ver good support...I we highly recommend it...one less star for the price....I think it's expensive...
5	1401926400	This is the only bra I wear as a nursing mom. They are comfy, easy to use and machine washable. They stretch a little, but still support you well.
4	1401926400	Hmmm,not a lot of support but good quality material and well done.I will wear it for a wile and see than.
5	1401840000	I have invested in both good and bad nursing bras. At first, I was reluctant to purchase this bra because I wasn't sure if it would truly be comfortable and it's more expensive than other nursing bras. BUT, I am so glad I ordered this. The fit is great and it is SO comfortable!! I highly recommend this for anyone who is nursing or if you just want a comfy bra!
5	1401840000	Love this nursing bra, I havent used it for nursing yet, as I'm still waiting for the baby to arrive. I ordered a size large a few months ago to wear throughout pregnancy, and it has saved me. Best purchase yet by far. Don't wait to get this bra, you'll thank yourself for the comfort. It has surprisingly good support and shaping for a soft structured bra, and there are several rows of hooks, and fully adjustable straps for just the right fit. I was concerned about ordering this bra sight unseen, as I usually wear a 36-38 DD, and rarely find support and comfort without underwire, but I am happy to say this bra was the miracle I had been waiting for, comfort support and shape all in one.
5	1401753600	Comfortable bra! I love that there's no underwire and I still have great support. I am a 36 D while nursing and the large fit perfectly. I just wish it came in white.
4	1401753600	Great Bra! 34 DD And The Large Is Perfect. Very Comfortable, Nice Material, No Complaints So Far. I Would But This Again
5	1401753600	This bra is absolutely amazing! It fits perfect and provides the right amount of support. Now, I need one in every color!
5	1401667200	Its perfect to me!very comfortable and convince for feedingIm love it&#9829;&#9829;I recommen to you!&#9829;&#9829;&#9829;good luck to you
5	1401667200	Comfortable. Good padding thickness and no back fat. I used the size chart based on another bravado that I was sized for in a boutique so the size chart on the bravado website was very accurate.
5	1401667200	I love this one, I am still using it on baby number 2, 3 years after original purchase.  Not going to lie I wore it a few times while not pregnant or nursing too :)
5	1401667200	I am in love with this bra.  It's so soft and so comfortable around my torso, which I always struggle with with bras.  I may continue wearing this thing after I stop nursing since it's probably the most comfortable bra I've ever owned.  And I love the pink color.  Soft, pretty, fun.  I almost took off a star because, as some previous reviewers have mentioned, the pads in the cups do tend to shift around either during washing or just from having it flipped down to nurse.  That can be annoying, but even so, I friggin' love this bra!
5	1401321600	I have been nursing babies for 20 years and tried many styles of bras.  This is my favorite.  Comfy. Shapely.  Pads are removeable and perfect coverage.
5	1401321600	Love love love this bra. It's so comfortable!  I was very reluctant to spend the money on this but I'm so glad I did. I spent most of my pregnancy wearing cheap and uncomfortable bras and after getting this one I regret not getting it sooner!
5	1401235200	Very comfortable!! I was hesitant to not wear an underwire but it had great support and coverage. Great for a growing pregnant body.
3	1401148800	Try it on,was disappointed in the lack of support. But it was very comfortable, maybe i just need a med size or just return it..
5	1400976000	I'm now nursing my 2nd baby and to say I am fed up with my nursing tank tops is an understatement! At first my tank tops were great to hide my post-natal stomach but now that I've lost most of my baby belly I didn't want the extra clothing. This bra is like cross between a sports bar and a regular wireless bra. Super comfy and the clips are easy to snap/unsnap to nurse. The other great feature this bra offers it a conversion kit for when you are done nursing. I think this is such a nice feature since this (almost all nursing bras) are so expensive. At least I know my $45 is going to go far beyond my nursing years. I have 2 of these and wear them full time every day. I wash them twice a week roughly and dry in my dryer. They have held up really well! I plan to buy 2 more.
5	1400889600	I am currently 7 months pregnant and LOVE this bra!  It is so incredibly comfortable to sleep in or wear around the house.  I feel like it will grow with me after delivery which is another feature I was looking for.  While it is more supportive than most bras I would be able to comfortably sleep in, I'm not sure I would wear it as a &#34;regular&#34; bra under a nice shirt.  However, it was still totally worth the investment because I feel like my boobs are being held up by clouds right now.For reference I am a 34 DDD and the medium fits perfectly.  There is definitely room to grow but it isn't loose either, if that makes sense.
5	1400889600	Really comfortable night or day. The clips are easy to use. The pink color is really cute, too. Overall, I'm very happy with it.
3	1400803200	Bra is okay. Pain to unlatch and latch the strap when nursing. It requires 2 hands which is not ideal when you have a baby in your arms. Support is good for these heavy puppies, however, so it depends what is more Imprtant to you....still looking for the perfect nursing bra!!!
5	1400716800	I will never buy nursing bras from Target or Walmart again! These are so comfortable and fit wonderfully. My two complaints would be that I don't really feel they wash that well for the price. I've been using four of these for about two months and they're looking kind of ratty and worn. I also wish they would just sew the pads in because they always come out in the wash or fold up. I would never use the bra without them anyway...
4	1400716800	I was looking for a nursing bra that wasn't too &#34;mom-ish&#34; and this one has done the trick. While no normal bra, the lowish cut works well with most shirts and the fit is flattering, giving a little lift and ensuring no show-through. The band underneath and straps are comfortable and stay put. It's easy to access when time for feeding and stays folded down well, not intruding on baby's space. Overall, I like the product and would recommend it! I'm 36C and ordered medium which worked well though i can see how there would be room for a bit larger bust in a medium.
5	1400630400	Comfortable/ Good support. Padded so you cant tell I have on breast pads. o comfortable I could sleep in it. As far as the sizing goes I would be a small, but I got a medium just in case and it fits great. May need to consider getting a size larger than recommended,
2	1400630400	This bra is very comfortable and stays in place with no adjustments. Too bad it doesn't support my boobs even a little bit. I'm a 38 DD and this isn't doing anything for me. Maybe it will be different when I'm nursing...we'll see...
1	1400544000	I hate this bra. If I didn't spend so much money on it, I would just throw it away. I bought it because everyone always raved about it - why? I don't know. I was looking for a bra that didn't have any wire and so would be comfortable around my rib cage while still pregnant. The disappointment? There is just so much going on. There are 4 clasps and a ton of material. The cups inside the bra are smaller than the actual cup and sometimes appear as really large nipples under shirts. There is also a string that connects the strap to the inside of the cup for when you release the snap for breast feeding. That string is WAY excessively long. It sticks out the sides all of the time, just like the strings on the inside shoulders of shirts that would hang on hangers. At the end of the day I cannot wait to get this thing off. The material is soft and does not ball up after being washed like some cheap bras do. But I would never buy this bra again.
5	1400544000	This is my favorite nursing bra, so much so that I have one in every color. Very comfortable and flattering. Highly recommended.
5	1400544000	I waited and waited to buy this and then finally caved because I could not go another day in a nursing tank and really needed a real bra again.  I crossed my fingers that the good reviews would hold up for me and they do. The bra is very comfortable and fits nicely, looks smooth under clothes and gives me a decent shape.  i ordered the butterscotch color to start with but will be ordering another in black shortly now that I know I like it. Very comfortable and worth the expense to me.
5	1400544000	This bra feels great. There's nice comfortable support which is really needed for the abuse they get from breast feeding. I would recommend it to any breast feeding mother. I purchased both a black and nude one and they look good.
5	1400457600	This would have been great in the first few months of nursing when all bras were uncomfortable. I live in this bra on the weekends now. It's soft, comfortable, and has suitable padding for a nursing mother.
5	1400457600	Fits great. Really comfortable with great support and easy to use for nursing. Also gives great coverage for moms security.
5	1400457600	I have a hard time finding bras that fit my figure and that are comfortable. I LOVE this bra. I wear it with and without the cups and. I am a 34b when not pregnant, and go up to a C when I'm pregnant and nursing. Ordered a size medium which fit perfectly. At first it was just a little bit tight, but after a couple days it's wonderful. The material is awesome and very soft. I've ordered two so far, and won't buy anything else while nursing.
5	1400371200	I bought mine one size down, I got a Medium where while breast feeding I am a DD. It is is comfortable with no jabbing wires. It kind of acts like a sports bra where it pushes my boobs together, but that could be a result of having the smaller size. It provides decent support, although you will not be doing any running in this bra. I like the nursing clips, they actually stay clipped, and the breast cover comes all the way down, instead of partially down like other nursing bras.
5	1400371200	SO comfortable (I wear it 24/7 and I have very sensitive skin, and have had no problems - other nursing bras I've tried are itchy/uncomfortable while sleeping), it fits well, and it is easy to use the nursing clips.  Highly recommend!
5	1400284800	i heard that it is very comfortable,so i ordered two of them.when i received the Bra,I was so pleased.I tried it on,and as it was said,it's very comfortable.i like it very much.But the size is a little small for me.I will give birth to my baby in July.I hope that it will not be too small.Anyway,i'd like to recommend it to my sister and my friends.
4	1400284800	I have bought many of these. They are supportive, the pads that come with it are removable. My favorite nursing bra so far. It can sometimes feel like it squishes your breasts too much. Also works well with nursing tanks.
5	1400198400	I just received the Bravado Body Silk Seamless Nursing Bra in in ivory. I have been using the Cake Nursing Bra in medium and love it, so I decided to give this a go! I am a 38C at Victoria's Secret, but a 38B almost everywhere else. I got a size Medium and it fits great! I use it on the second to last hook, so I have some room to grow/shrink. So far, the removable pads haven't bothered me yet, but I can see how they can get bunched up easily. They are very easy to insert and fix, or just take out if they bother you.I will be buying more!
5	1400198400	I ended up needing two different sizes between the birth of my baby and weaning.  Get 3 of each and you're all set.  They are dramatically more flattering and more comfortable than any other nursing bra I tried on, even to sleep in.  I cannot recommend them enough.  Worth every penny.
5	1400198400	I had to start wearing nursing bras at about 25 weeks because I was carrying high, walking and sweating a lot to/from work, and the underwires in my regular bras were chafing me. These were awesome; easy to adjust, easy to use, and the straps NEVER fell down.
5	1400112000	This bra is very comfortable and fits well.  It is worth spending a few extra dollars to get this bra.  After receiving my first one, I ordered two more.
2	1400112000	I purchased a different model of Bravado nursing bra which I liked quite a lot. I thought that I might try this one also as it gets good reviews. Although the other small sized bra fits me just fine, this one fit slightly too large. It provided decent support and was comfortable, but the cups are sewn with a little bunching at the bottom which my breasts just didn't fill out. When I put a shirt on over this, my chest just looked lumpy and bizarre. I had to send it back.
5	1400025600	I am underwhelmed with the shape and support I found in the majority of nursing bras I have tried.  I think this bra has good support without being too tight, and creates a flattering shape.
5	1400025600	Don't think twice. Must buy. SO comfortable and easy to clip. Worth every penny. Just ordered my second one. Sizing is great. And very adjustable strap
5	1400025600	These bras are expensive, but they are incredibly comfortable.  They wash well, fit well, and I'm really pleased I found them.  I have two, which I rotate between.
5	1399939200	Soft, comfortable, stretchy material offers gentle support. Great to sleep in. I normally wear a size DD bra, and a lot of softer bras advertised for sleeping are not supportive enough or shaped right to lay down in without &#34;the girls&#34; falling out. I can actually wear this bra all night and day. I can also work the clasps one handed, which is very handy when holding a hungry infant.
5	1399852800	This is the best nursing bra I've found so far - I am ordering several more! Perfect fit and really comfortable!
5	1399852800	Light weight, breathable.  No underwire.  Soft.  Accomodates nursing pads nicely.  I have owned lots of nursing bras, this is my favorite.  I can wear it to bed as well as everyday.
5	1399766400	I'm on my third kid and have tried every nursing bra out there. This one is awesome. I ordered one and then went right back and ordered 2 more.I don't wear any other bra - it's great.
5	1399680000	I have an older version of this bra that I used when nursing my older child.  I actually continued wearing it after weaning and throughout my next pregnancy!What I like:- Soft, stretchy - This bra stretches to accommodate your changing body during pregnancy and nursing.- No underwire!  - I didn't like the feel of underwire when I was nursing.  If you do, this is not the bra for you!- lightly padded - The bra comes with two (removable!) pads.  I like that they help to cover up the presence of nursing pads underneath.  The removable pads are easier to place than in my older version, so this is an improvement!Meh:-it's not the most attractive bra... but I'm always more about function than appearance, anyway!- I thought the sizing was confusing at first, and it's different for some of Bravado's other products, so check their website for the specific sizing/measurements.Bottom line:- This bra is versatile and holds up well (over years of use!!).  I will probably buy another one to add to my rotation!
5	1399680000	This is the best nursing bra I've found. Fits well and is comfortable. Gives support. Easy to clasp and unclasp. I've bought several and bought a new one recently for baby #2.
5	1399593600	I've tried four nursing bras in total, but after I found this one, I stopped wearing the others. The clasping mechanisms are strong, but able to operate. The material is soft, and although there are no underwires, its thickness manages to give good support. I'm back on this page so that I can buy more!
5	1399593600	These are my favorite nursing bras. I love them so much that after I bought one from my LC, I ordered this one off of Amazon so I wouldn't have to go back out and buy another. They fit great, true to size, and are SO comfortable.
5	1399593600	This is my favorite nursing bra. It's easy to use, comfortable, etc.  I bought 3 because I wear them so much.
4	1399507200	The bra fits well and the material is soft against the skin. I really like that it fits like a sports bra but more comfortably. I picked a size up so I can grow into it and I bought a bra extender in case I get bigger. I started at 34B and I'm now at 38C. Size large fits nicely with some space to grow into.
5	1399507200	One of the most comfortable bras that I own, I wear it 24/7. I feel supported even if there are no underwires and the fit was perfect. You can easily use one hand to snap the front panels off/on when feeding your LO. It withstood the test of time, I'm still wearing the same bras with my second baby and it hardly shows any wear/tear. It also comes with a conversion kit that can turn your nursing bra into a regular bra. The only thing is the removable foam inserts are your basic bikini top inserts. But it does provide enough padding, if used with nursing pads. You also have to take care not to loose them in the wash and readjust them as they crinkle up after washing. Otherwise it's a great product and I'm going to buy a couple more!
5	1399420800	I'm within a few weeks of my due date. I've read these other reviews and had this bra in my cart for a while now. I finally just bought it since I will need it for breastfeeding.  I regret not buying it sooner! It is the most comfortable thing I own now! Very accommodating of your belly and supportive at the same time. Cups inside are removable if need be but add shape. You can't tell that you are wearing a wireless &#34;nursing bra&#34;. I will definitley be purchasing another one of these to have on hand.
5	1399420800	Great bra for nursing. Its comfortable, easy to let down, and your boobs look normal in it. I've bought two now because I really like them.
5	1399420800	I was an all underwire bra wearer until I got this bra and have had great support and comfort throughout my pregnancy.  It is smooth and seamless.  After washing the padding tends to either completely come out or get a little crooked but it's an easy fix.  The padding gives me coverage without making me feel super padded.  I hope to wear this bra beyond pregnancy and nursing - it's that comfortable.
5	1399334400	I bought 3 different nursing bras and this was the only one that felt like it offered a little more support without being painful.  I have had it for 3 months now and I can say it is still comfortable but it is definitely stretching out and loosing support.  Overall I would recommend it, but I don't think I'll get a full year out of it.
3	1399334400	Even though the band is too loose for me, the cups fit pretty well. It's the best fitting nursing bra I've found (I'm 34E). I love this in the nude color. It's comfortable even for sleeping. Unfortunately, the trim and back clasp of the black version are a stiffer, shinier material that irritates my skin. I much prefer the nude version.
5	1399334400	I don't know how to use it but my wife does. She has good comments on it about its quality.
5	1399334400	Comfortable, convenient, specially if you are working mom. Material is soft and is durable.Will be ordering couple more of them.
5	1399248000	This mama feels spoiled! I absolutely LOVE this bra. It fits extremely well, and has the supportive feeling of an underwire bra without the risk of mastitis or the discomfort/shifting.Everything about this bra is quality and I cannot wait to order one or two more in the near future. :)
5	1399248000	The Bravado bra is the most comfortable nursing bra that I own.  The material is flexible and accommodating which is nice if you have had more time in between pumping/feeding.  It is not a &#34;sexy&#34; nursing bra but very functional.
5	1399161600	I bought these when I got pregnant long before I was nursing. They expand perfectly as you grow. They're also so comfortable you can wear them to sleep.
5	1399075200	after I received this bra in an order containing 4 different nursing bras, I can easily say, &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  This was the most expensive bra I ordered and all the other &#34;less expensive&#34; bras are getting returned.  I'd rather have 2 Bravado nursing bras than 6 generic, cheap nursing bras.  The material is stretchy and forgiving, with a wide band around the sides that doesn't give me the &#34;back rolls&#34; that other bras do.  This is truly a bra that will grow with you...buy one as soon as your regular bra gets uncomfortable during your pregnancy.  You might as well use it as long as you can. I wish I had bough these sooner!
4	1398988800	I recently purchased this nursing bra after being severely disappointed with cheaper nursing bras. I am extremely happy that I did, although only time will tell if it holds up (I'll post again in a few months).I am 39 weeks pregnant and wanted to have at least one nursing bra on hand that was actually comfortable (and at least somewhat supportive). Most of my other purchases were from big box stores, mainly Target, and would fit ok in store and then be unwearable after about a half day. I had heard over and over good reviews on this bra, but the price put me off. Eventually I realized that rather than have 3 unwearable bras for the same price, I should have just tried this one. Amazon also seems to have the best price on this bra.My bra size has gone up immensely during pregnancy (from 36C to 38DD), and I'm thinking it may increase even more. I purchased the large because my current size seemed to be in the mid range for the large. When I first tried this bra on, I thought it might be a bit too small to allow for any growth. I also didn't really like the pads included, so I was worried that this would be another disappointment. After a couple of weeks of wear, I can tell you that this is my favorite bra I have. It isn't nearly as supportive as underwire, obviously, but it is very comfortable all day and has enough coverage to wear to work without worry. I took the pads out and like it better, but that might be my personal preference.I feel that the bra already fits better, but I'm slightly worried that is because it is stretching out, as other reviewers have posted can be a problem. It is so comfortable now, though, that I'm going to put aside my skepticism because I've FINALLY found something that fits and I can wear all day comfortably. I plan to purchase another, but am waiting until after the baby & nursing to make sure I want another large, and don't need to upsize. Will update this review in the future.
4	1398988800	Love this bra! Its very comfortable and will make nursing my baby easier. Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'd like a little better support..it doesn't lift and support as much as I'd like but other than that it's a great bra! Much more comfortable than all of my other bras!
5	1398902400	Good design! Fit me well and it's very comfortable. It's the color I expected. You can wear it when u sleep.
5	1398902400	I didn't expect this bra to fit as perfectly as it does, I am very pleased, since I did NOT feel like going to try on bras in a store at this point in my pregnancy. It is also made with high quality materials.  I used the size chart provided to figure out which size to order.
4	1398816000	You've probably read about the insert cups - take them out if they bother you. Also keep in mind since it has cups, its already shaped - if you're big busted, this probably isn't for you. The form works well enough for me, I got a medium and I'm a C cup. I like he secure back, it has three hooks. Comfortable material, too.
5	1398729600	snaps are easy to undo and re-clasp, the only problem with this bra is that it's high-cut in front so it can't be worn with dresses (like for a wedding) that are lower cut. I'll have to end up having to wear a sleeping bra that is lower cut in front, but for under regular nursing-friendly tops, this bra is great!
3	1398729600	So ideally I would give this 3.5 stars.  Picky I know.Pros:This bra starts out AMAZING!  So comfortable, I pretty much lived in the ones I had during the first couple months of nursing.  Night and day - it was soft and comfy which is exactly what sore boobs and tired mommies need postpartum.  I just can't say it enough - it was SO comfortable!  That is the main thing it has going for it. The clasps work fine; it was fully functional as a nursing bra.Pro/Cons:This bra is thin without the inserts, so its a good thing the inserts are included otherwise you can definitely get some severe headlights showing up.  Unfortunately I never found that the inserts laid flat when tucked in the pockets after I had pulled the bra down to nurse.  They always folded up and I was left with either a noticeably bumpy bra front or I had to sit there and fiddle inside the pocket to unfold the insert.  SERIOUS bummer when you are trying to hold a baby too, AND nurse in public.  So I actually just ended up placing the insert pads next to my boobs instead of within the bra pockets themselves.  Workable but more cumbersome. This bra would have been so much better had the material itself been thicker to negate the need for the inserts.  No headlights and no folding inserts would have been a much better combo.Cons:So the real downside in my opinion is the fact that since the bra is so stretchy and insanely comfortable, it really doesn't hold up well in the long run.  I felt by 6 months, this thing had stretched out more than it was able to recover from after being washed.  In other words, even though it regained some shape in the wash, it wasn't back to the original, and as a result things just got saggy.  I realize that nursing bras can have a rough life and although I'd love to see a nursing bra made these days to last through more than one kid nursing, I'd at least like to see them last a full year of nursing.  I have another one that has lasted well, past the 12 month mark.  (And I KNOW that all nice bra stores say to buy new bras after 3-6m of use anyways-but WHO does that?!)Anyways, it's ridiculously comfortable and maintained shape pretty consistently for the first 6 months, but after that the sag set in too much.  (P.S. The wash routine was wash on warm/cold and then always air dry.)
5	1398729600	As any women who has been pregnant knows, the increase in breast size can be very uncomfortable at times.  More irritating for me was realizing that the initial bras i purchased would not make it through breast feeding due to the fact the i was still growing and the under wire.This bra just grew with me and was versatile.  I was able to wear it to work out, 14 hour shifts at work, with everyday clothing and t-shirts as well.Highly recommend.
5	1398729600	This bra was recommended to me by another new mom. It fits great and is very comfortable. Would highly recommend.
4	1398729600	It's comfortable and easy to use when nursing but definitely bigger than I expected...high coverage in the front so it peeks out of some of my tanks and after one wear the bottom band stretches out and it a bit loose. Since this is normal for seamless bras, I recommend you go with the smaller size you think you'll need.
5	1398729600	Fit Perfectly , so comfy even to sleep withAmazing I'm planning to get another oneA must have for momHighly recommend
3	1398729600	Fits great around the rib cage but definitely runs small in the cup size. I would definitely recommend ordering a size larger than you need.
5	1398729600	This bra was definitely worth the price. Comfortable but supportive at the same time. I would not be surprised if I continued wearing it even I no longer nurse!
5	1398729600	I Love it! Fits great soft material. Definatly recommend to a friend. I will buy more in other colors when I can.
5	1398643200	I was uneasy about buying a nursing bra online and was so pleased when it came. I am due in 6 weeks so my milk still needs to come in so I ordered a size up. I'm am currently a 40 DD from a 36 D and the Xlarge fits good and gives me room to grow. It's so comfy and I've been using it daily since I got it. Best nursing bra out there. Very supportive and comfortable!!
3	1398643200	Easy to use and comfy. I am large chested and this is the first time my breast sweated in a bra. Bra holds onto sweat and get stinky fast.
5	1398643200	I had bad back ache with Motherhood bras. I wore Motherhood Bra for 15 minutes and I had excruciating back pain. I tried many times and the same ache everytime. So I decided to plunge in and purchase this one from Bravado. AMAZING. I wear them whole day without any ache or uncomfortable feeling. It is just a very good product.I will be buying more for sure.
5	1398556800	Wish I had this bra for my first child who I nursed for 10 months. By far the best nursing bra I've purchased and used. The material is comfortable and washes really well. The straps are strong and very supportive. I wasn't sure if I was going to get the same &#34;lift&#34; as with an underwire bra, but this bra is actually better in that category. Also, I don't get the discomfort like I do with a wired nursing bra - especially in the beginning when engorged. Definitely getting more colors. Sizing was great too. A little expensive, but worth the money.
4	1398470400	I love this bra. The cups create a nice shape and also protect my clothes from leaked milk, although the removable cup liners do move around a bit and need to be readjusted sometimes.
3	1398470400	the fit was not good, though the materials were nice.  i wish i had bought a larger size, too bad.
3	1398470400	Seems like it will be extremely comfortable. I think it will make a great sleep bra but the foam cups that they say give a lining are so visible I won't likely be wearing this bra out in public. Without the lining You'll see nipples/ pads like crazy with them you will see the cups- they are not only visible but they move around and wrinkle. Pretty disappointed as it came so highly recommended but the search will continue for the perfect access and coverage.
5	1398297600	This was a gift for my daughter whose baby is due in a few months. She stated she really liked it and it was very comfortable
5	1398211200	Got this to wear the last trimester of pregnancy and am still wearing it 10 months postpartum as a nursing bra. They hold up great in the wash.  I have several colors. Love the removable pads for shaping and preventing nipple show through.  I always stick a removable nursing pad inside to keep the bra clean and dry during sleep or nursing session.  Can't go wrong with these. They stretch to fit a changing figure and the colors look cute if the straps happen to peek out from your regular top.  Perfect when paired with the Undercover Mama nursing tank. Love them both.
4	1398211200	I bought this bra while I was pregnant since I had outgrown my normal bras. I was hesitant to buy a nursing bra during pregnancy, but it has been great. The bra is comfortable and supportive.My only compliant is that the lining of the bra is thin without the removable pads in.
5	1398211200	I have tried so many different types of nursing bras and this is by far the most comfortable!  It is supportive, functional, and so, so comfy.  Ordered more than one color because I liked it so much!  It's not the cheapest you can buy, but worth every penny.
5	1398211200	I bought this mainly because of good review.  But I can't be happier.  This bra not only is comfortable, also can be worn till my baby arrives.  It has space to grow and also easy snap-on for nursing.  I am planning to get more of them.
5	1398211200	I am not quite an 34A cup normally and maybe almost a 34B when I'm nursing.  I have a hard time finding good nursing bras that fit and look good.  I ordered the small and it fits perfect!  I love the soft cups because I leak through my nursing pads often and the cups keep it from getting on my shirt (so embarrassing).  The best part though is that my boobs actually look good without having to wear and uncomfortable unwire.  I really want to buy a second one!!!
4	1398211200	I followed the size guide and the band fits great. My only complaint is that I spill over the cups especially when I am full and need to nurse or pump.
5	1398124800	Seriously worth every penny.  After Buying one at target which I absolutely hate and trying on every one target had (which all were either too stiff or not soft enough) I decided to take a chance and get one online.  I was unsure about the sizing,  but gave it a try. Ohhh am I glad I did,  it literally is so comfortable I am going to get another for when I'm done nursing.  Fits true to size chart and a little room to grow as your milk production increases.  I would wear this as a sleep nursing bra. Truly is very silky soft to touch,  provides the support you need as well.
5	1398124800	very nice material. feels comfortable when wearing in my late pregnancy. save this for future nursing purpose. my size should be M, but feels a little bit smaller, it may because of the short of breath in the last several weeks...
4	1398124800	It's obvious this is a great product, but I went a size too small.  I am a 34 C and chose a small the first time around.  The cups are too close together giving my breasts an odd shape.  I'll be exchanging it for size medium and hope, hope, hope it's a good fit b/c I really want this bra to work for me.
5	1397865600	This bra is the most comfortable bra. Super soft and fits great. I love it.. I definitely recommend to all pregnant women out there.
5	1397779200	This bra is great. So comfortable you can hardly feel you're wearing it, and provides real support. I'm buying my second.
1	1397779200	The worst thing about this bra is the clasp. I HATED that the clasp to undo the cup was way up near my shoulder. Sorry, but I don't want to go fishing up/down my shirt for the clip every time I need to nurse. Not to mention having to dig around again when baby is finished! They are not one-handed clasps either since the straps that held everything up when you opened the cup to nurse were WAY too long, so you had to hold them still in order to close the clasp! I bought the right size for me according to the sizing chart. When my milk first came in, I was about a 36C, and now, my baby is 7 months old and I'm a 36B. The cups were large, but the band barely fit around me. Speaking of the cups, the foam inserts are laughable at how perfectly circular they are. They're like the little bowls you buy for baby cereal, and you're supposed to wear these? I went without them. Completely useless. Still searching for the perfect bra...
4	1397692800	The item is delivered on time. I followed the size chart and ordered a small one. It fits me well. The material is comfortable and supportive.It's a bit expensive but worth to have one.
5	1397692800	First of all I love the material. It is very very soft. It is fits perfect for me. I will definitely recommend it.
4	1397692800	I like this bra over my other bras but there is one small issue.  There is a strap that keeps the bra up when the flap is open for breast feeding and that strap it a bit long for me.  When the flaps are up the strap kind of sits there and bunches up a little because it is too long.  This would not deter me from buying this product again because all in all it is very comfortable.  I also was excited to see a thicker band around the bottom of the bra but it doesn't stay that way.  My 33 week preggo belly pushes up on it and scrunches it into a thinner band lol.
5	1397692800	This is my third baby and I finally found one that is comfortable and practical! I can wear my normal clothes and not to worry it looks weird because of the padding. It is extra soft and comfortable, especially when I am engorged! I can unbutton top few buttons on my shirt when my breasts are full and it looks like a tank top! I am going to buy one in a different color!
5	1397606400	Perfect fit especially for a larger chested person.  Very easy to nurse with.  Worth the money you pay vs the cheaper bras that are not near as comfortable!
4	1397606400	I think this bra is insanely comfortable. I'm 40D and bought the size large. I wish the straps were wider on the larger sizes. I took the cups out so I didn't have to mess with those. If you want two separate perky boobs and you are larger than say a 36C.....this is NOT the bra for you! If you're looking for comfort around the house or a bra to carpool your kids to school with a larger bust then this fits the bill. I prefer the Anita underwire bras, but had to see what the hype was about. I've nursed three babes over 8.5years and tried lots of bras. This one is more like a nursing sports bra without the sports bra support/tightness. Def gives a uniboob.
4	1397606400	Item came as described, and while it was a little snug, I found it to be very comfortable as other reviewers have said. Looking to get another one.
3	1397520000	The bra is very comfortable, but it is very difficult to close with one hand.  I do not care for the single string of elastic holding the bra together because it stretches too much, which is what makes it too hard to close.
4	1397520000	Fits well and is comfortable. The support is not as good as a wired bra, but is a good nursing bra.
5	1397520000	I was looking for a good supporting nursing bra and couldn't find one anywhere. All the nursing bras I've had never fit right and always wore out leaving no support. So I looked up best nursing bras and this one came up. I got it in today and put it on and boy was I impressed, its the most comfortable bra I've ever worn, even before I was nursing. It has great support and is so soft. The padding is perfect. I just love everything about this bra. It also comes with a conversion kit for when your done nursing, I will be using that. I will definitely be buying more of these bras!
1	1397520000	I just called in to attempt a return on an item within 30 days of receiving it, and when I called in, I dealt with a string of hostile customer representatives.  It turns our that their fine print return policy is 30 days from when *shipping* meaning if you are unlucky enough to do standard shipping of 6-8 days and get two weekends in that timeframe, you only have 2 weeks.  This bad news is delivered to you in the rudest way possible from the get go.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
5	1397520000	Absolutely LOVE this bra. I just found it with baby number two, wish I had found it the first time! I have many nursing bras, this is by far my favorite, but I bought two. Pricey, but well worth it. Just remove pads before washing, the bra washes well, I put mine in a garment bag. Doesn't look great in the picture, but it supports well, I'm a DD and it does a decent job holding me up especially since it doesn't have an underwire. DEFINITELY a must :-)
5	1397520000	The fit is great, the support is wonderful. As a gal with larger boobs, its great to find something that fits so well.
3	1397433600	I bought this because several reviews said this is the nursing bra to buy for maximum support without an underwire. I wear a D cup (a DD while nursing) so I'm quite large. This bra did NOT provide the support I was hoping for, so I could not use it as an &#34;out and about&#34; bra. It was fine to wear while at home, and IS extremely comfortable and functional, but I just wanted my girls up in their place when I was out. Unfortunately I went back to just wearing my regular bras whenever I was in public and dealing with the added inconvenience of unhooking the bras in the back. For my money and expectations, I was disappointed, but I did use the bra a lot at home, and did even find it comfortable enough to sleep in on occasion.
5	1397433600	Love this bra!  Extremely comfortable (comfortable enough to even sleep in). It also has enough support to wear  out and about and easy to use when baby is hungry.
5	1397347200	Living in a small town and procrastinating forced me to look online for a bra.  I've never bought a bra without trying it on and was nervous about it not fitting right.  I measured a 36 D before I gave birth so I ordered the medium and it fits perfectly, it is so comfortable I don't even mind sleeping in it!  I love that it's wire free yet still gives support and shape.  I'm wearing mine on the last hook right now, which is great because I know I'll drop some weight and won't have to buy a new bra.  I can't say enough how pleased I am with this product!!!  :)
5	1397347200	I have 4 of these bras.  A must-have...so much better than the bras available at Motherhood Maternity.  You could use these for everyday, and at night (I sleep in them sometimes).  They are more supportive than the pretty much useless sleep bras at Motherhood.
5	1397174400	Great fit! Would recommend to all nursing mothers. Very comfortable and easy to use for BF moms. Worth the money.
4	1397088000	Love it!  Super comfortable but supportive at the same time.  I only ordered one to make sure I got the right size, but, I will definitely be ordering more.
3	1397088000	I didn't feel it was the best nursing bra I've used. The clasps at the top of the bra (easy access clasps) were really tough to unlatch and latch. I didn't feel it gave the full support needed for a nursing bra. I want the look of a bra when wearing a t-shirt, not a sports bra and I felt it was more sports bra like. I had another brand in years past that was perfect and I can't find it- but I still have time to look. I returned this bra in hopes I will find the brand I like. It'll definitely do the trick if you're in a hurry to order a bra, however, I don't think it was the best for the price. You can spend about $10.00 more on a quality bra and it truly makes such a difference when nursing for months to come. (I purchased my last 'perfect' nursing bra from a lactation specialist at the hospital I delivered at- I'll likely do that again. Can't beat the quality and fit- and it's SO worth it. Nursing is challenging enough with the complication of an uncomfortable bra.)
2	1397088000	Hard to tell how I'll really like it, as the fit was too big, so cups are more come shaped. I plan to try the size down and hope for a better fit, as this nursing bra came highly recommended.
5	1397001600	Very nice and comfortable.  I'm a 36DD when I'm nursing and tend to feel large and wide.  This bra makes me look somewhat pulled together.
4	1397001600	This bra is true to size and very comfortable.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.  It washes well.
5	1397001600	This is the best nursing bra I've owned.  It's comfortable and supportive.  I haven't used it to nurse yet, as I'm still pregnant, but I think it will be easy.  My only (very little) complaint is that the bottom rolls up a bit, but I think it's because I'm 7mo pregnant and my belly pushes it up.  Buy this bra!
1	1396915200	I don't understand why this bra is so highly rated. I am a 36 DD and it offers no support and I hate polyester fabric. I guess if you are smaller, it might work better. It's worth spending an extra 20.00 to get a quality nursing bra that you will be wearing all the time.
5	1396915200	I love this nursing bra! It fits perfectly. Not only is it comfortable like a sports bra but your breast don't droop and you also have the option of converting it into a regular bra after your completely done with breastfeeding.  I plan to buy another in a different color.
5	1396915200	LOVE this bra!!! Was just telling my other nursing friends about how comfortable this bra is! Great under tshirts, as there is just the perfect padding and great form.I probably could have gone with a medium, but was worried about being too tight and the large is fine!
5	1396828800	I highly recommend this bra. It fits great, keeps pads concealed, and is super comfortable! If u are nursing, this bra is great!
4	1396828800	I used this bra a few months for nursing before I became pregnant with our second baby, and it is really comfortable. Not a ton of support, since its fairly stretchy, and if you take out the removable pads, the bra itself is really thin. I have to adjust the pads almost every time I put it on, because if they aren't in the right spot I feel like they shape me weird, since they are rounded in form. Over all though, I am happy I bought this.
3	1396828800	I like the bra and it does fit comfortably. However, I am a busty woman. I wear a 38D to 38DD depending on who makes the bra. When looking at this size chart I thought that the large would fit well and allow for a little expansion room. The bra fits tightly and there is definitely not room to grow. I would recommend going with a size bigger than what the size chart tells you.
5	1396828800	I've tried several nursing bras and this one is worth the investment. It's got enough support and is very comfy. I could even wear it to seep if I wanted.
4	1396742400	Comfortable fit. Nursing, I'm a 34G, large size is perfect. Smooth and attractive under clothes. Easy to unsnap. Like it and wear it quite a bit. Only complaint is that it is hot - does not seem to wick moisture, which is an issue now that I have larger breasts and carry a baby heat pack with me.
4	1396656000	I love this bra.  It fits great, looks perfectly smooth under my clothes (can't say the same for my other nursing bras).  I would happily say it's worth the price, but there's one small problem.  On its second time through the wash, one of the metal hooks on the closure broke.  It's not the end of the world and I still use the bra, but with only 2 of the 3 hooks fastened.  I was quite surprised as I always wash my bras with the rest of my clothes and have never had this problem.  No doubt something I can easily fix with a new hook and some needle and thread, but kind of a pain for a $45 bra.
5	1396656000	Hands down the best nursing bras. As others said, the cup liners fit badly, but you really don't need them.
3	1396656000	This bra, while comfortable, is extremely full coverage on me.  I purchased the Medium (I was pre-preg a 34C, now a 36D or 38C, 135# and 5'7&#34;).  While it fits well around the band, the cups come up to my shoulders - I don't know what shirts I would ever be able to wear this with!  If it were winter and I was wearing high necked sweaters, it would probably be perfect.  Unfortunately I had to return it, and opted for the Reese bra at MM, which I am in love with btw.
5	1396656000	I love this bra. I got this bra before I was pregnant and of all the nursing bras I've purchased I seem to wear this one the most primarily because it has it's own padding that you can take out. I still wear nursing pads along with the bras pads for added protection. The bra I purchased (after many washes) started seeping out all of those little elastic strings all over the place...not bad just kind of annoying and slightly unsightly so I bought a new one!It's just as wonderful as before (although the new clasps always need a bit of breaking in). I can actually undo the claps with one hand (although you SHOULD use two). And unlike a lot of other nursing bras that I've tried this one doesn't make feel like I have a &#34;uni-boob&#34; or that my boobs are slumping.I highly recommend this bra and would absolutely buy it again.
5	1396483200	Highly recommend by my friend and that's why I bought it. It is really fit and comfortable. I do really recommend to buy it.
5	1396483200	I ordered a size medium based on the size chart but after trying this bra on in a local store i went with a large.I am 36c normally but right now i am about a 38d pre-milk supply. so I am hoping that a large will still fit once the milk comes in.based on the chart a 38D should have been a medium but it was too tight!Just FYI for other ladies out there!!
5	1396483200	It is Super comfortable with plenty of support for larger sizes.  The material is breathable, silky and I look forward to buying other colors.
5	1396483200	At first, this seemed like a lot to spend on a bra (at least for someone cheap, like me), but it has been worth every penny so far. I can wear it with all my clothing and it's even comfortable to wear at night. Best of all, the thick backing fits just right so it's very flattering if you are experiencing post pregnancy back fat ;)This bra makes it all go away! Love this buy!
5	1396483200	Great everyday nursing bra! Provides comfort and enough support for everyday routine. Product is easy to use and easy to adjust.
5	1396483200	Great fit, and so comfortable! Until now all of the other nursing bras that I had tried had itchy elastic that scratched me and made me uncomfortable. This bra is so soft and well-made!!! I ordered two more, very worth it!
5	1396396800	Very comfortable to wear all day long.  Washes well although you have to take the cups out otherwise they dont really do well in the dryer.  Easy to breast feed without fear of leaking on the other side
4	1396396800	The padding in the bra looks ridiculous.  Can't use them,  they make my boobs look deformed. Have to buy other padding
3	1396310400	This is my second time through the nursing game and I seriously wore out my bras from the 1st time around.  I ordered this one based on the great reviews and wore it for a few weeks before leaving this review.  It is a super comfy bra, I'll give it that.  And its stretchy fit means that whether I'm full of milk or on empty, the bra still fits.  But I have some complaints about the bra that have me already searching for a different one.CONS:- When the cups are detached for nursing or pumping, there are only thin straps left holding up the rest of the bra that easily slide off the shoulder.  This also means it's hard to detach the cup since the strap just wants to stretch out as you pull on the clasp.- There isn't really any division between the cups so you can end up with a uni-boob.- There isn't a lot of support.  This may be due to the lack of underwire but there is no underlying structure or seaming to this bra whatsoever.  That's what makes it so comfortable, but it also means your breasts end up sagging down within the cups.I've decided to only wear this bra at night as it's comfy and does what it needs to do, but it ended up being a bit pricy for just a sleeping nursing bra.
5	1396310400	I have 4 of these and find them comfortable and convenient, especially if I know I'll need to nurse while out and about. They fit a little big on me and stretched out some, but the band and straps adjust easily, so they still work great.
5	1396310400	Fits great, very comfortable on our brand new Mom. Would certainly recommend and purchase again. Quality and good value makes a 5 star review.
4	1396310400	Its very comfortable and it's not as thin as other brands. I decided to get another one in Black. Additionally it comes with a conversion kit to a non-nursing bra, I'll definitelly use it later.
5	1396310400	Love this bra! Very comfortable, which is a must when you're wearing a bra 24/7 for nursing. Easy to undo the clasps one handed, although a bit trickier to re-clasp them one handed. I love the optional padding insert because when I'm no longer nursing, I can use their conversion kit to turn it I to a regular bra and add some extra padding if needed. I've also been able to figure out how to use it to double pump hands free, which is very handy. Not as easy to accomplish this with other nursing bras. Overall, the next nursing bra I've used by far! WELL worth the money!
5	1396224000	I have breastfed 3 going on 4 babies and spent a LOT of time wearing nursing bras. It is not easy to find one that is supportive, comfortable, easy to nurse in and that looks pretty decent shape wise. I found this one when nursing my last baby and bought one to see if I liked it. A month or two later I bought a second. As I get ready for baby 4 I bought yet a 3rd! I definitely recommend this product. It is worth the price.
5	1396224000	Comfortable yet supportive and very well made (has held up in the wash incredibly well). The sizing is pretty flexible as well (fit before I delivered and after despite going up a cup size postpartum). I would recommend this bra to any nursing mother!
4	1396224000	38c 38d should buy L size, the m size is a little small.useful and convenientcomfortable for the fabric moterial
1	1396224000	I have searched for a nursing bra for weeks and thought this could be one that would work for me, but alas, I will be returning this one as well. The color is great, but that's the best thing going for it....from my perspective. One thing I was hoping for was a nursing bra that was less bulky than wearing a nursing tank. Not this one; there's likely just as much if not more fabric used in making this bra. And tell me, why does a nursing bra need to be padded?If you have a small frame (almost always an XS) and are small breasted like me, then this bra is likely NOT for you.
5	1396224000	This bra fitted from the very beginning of my pregnancy to the end and I have gone up 3 cup sizes ... i never want to take it off. The only thing i would say that's not perfectly awesome , is that it is in no way going to push UP your rack . This said , A+ for comfort.
3	1396224000	Very comfortable nursing bra that's perfect for at-home use or for sleeping. When you unclasp the hook in the front for nursing your entire breast falls open for nursing. I don't mind this at home but in public I'd prefer other bras that still have material around the breast that provide some coverage/privacy. I wear two tops (e.g. stretchy tank top as my first layer over the nursing bra and then another shirt over the tank top) when wearing this nursing bra.For someone with larger breasts it's hard to clasp the front hook with one hand while holding your baby. The bra is very stretchy and comfortable but could use a little more shape for women with larger breasts. I bought the XL and I'm a 38F while nursing.
5	1396137600	Ditto everyone here. I bought these in preparation for nursing (I am in my 36 weeks now), and they are so comfortable! It's all worth it. Can't wait for my baby to come out and nurse her.
5	1396137600	These bras are great. Comfortable enough to wear to bed but supportive enough for work, the neck and back line is not as obnoxious as some nursing bras. The padding is absorbent and removable for washing. They're easy to breastfeed in - you can open and close the snaps with one hand. I just wish I could afford to have another! I've got two, and that's not enough as I leak on them and the fabric gets stiff and scratchy with a single wearing.
4	1396137600	Love this nursing bra... Pink orchid is a beautiful fuschia color.  I just wish it would give more support.  Also I found the material to be almost too strechy..  I bought an xl based on the size chart and I should have gone with the L because of the stretch.  Otherwise.. Love this bra and recommend to everyone.
2	1396051200	Great bra but the bra runs small. Not for curvy , large breasted or full-figured women. Band size was fine but cup size was too small even with an XL.
4	1395964800	After several wearings it stretched out enough that it is comfortable to wear.  At first, it definitely felt too tight.  Also, I removed the inserts because they look ridiculous under my clothes.  I'm not sure this is going to carry me through nursing, since its already snug.
4	1395878400	It runs true to size. I would almost say go with your pre pregnancy size when selecting a size, I wore an XS in most non underwire bras and I got this one in a small and it's a tiny bit big.  But because of the hooks I can put it on the tightest and hook and tighten the straps and it fits nicely.The material is very soft and it really flatters your shape nicely.  The only reason I have it four stars and not five is because of the nursing clips. They are a little hard to unclip but that may be my inexperience.
3	1395792000	In all fairness, I don't like bras without underwire but this bra does not look good under clothes I would wear outside the house.
4	1395792000	I ordered the biggest size possible bc I have large breasts, I wear a 44 E. the band size is okay but the cup is slightly too small. It's very comfortable but not as supportive as I would like for everyday use. Overall I'm glad I ordered it and would recommend to friends.
5	1395792000	The large size is a little tight for a 38D.  Maybe should have gotten an XL but I feared that would be too big.
5	1395705600	I love bravado nursing bras. I bought two from the company with our second child, and then recently bought a few more with our third.  They are less expensive on amazon, which was a bonus. Though they are relatively expensive all things considered, it's worth it to me for the support, comfort and fit. So much better than any others I've tried!
5	1395705600	This is by far my favorite bra. I had to buy another one because this the only one I want to wear. I wish it wear more adjustable around my torso but for being a size 5, I felt like I maxed out how loose I can make it from the get go. Otherwise, it is super comfortable and has great support, which is a must for someone who suffers from engorgement.
5	1395705600	s&uacute;per comfortable. perfect fit. seems like it will accommodate a growing breast. extra padding. nothing is poking into the skin.
2	1395619200	This bra doesn't come in a size that will fit me. I have huge boobs when nursing but still have a small rib cage. I need something like a 32/34 E.  I tried the medium based on the sizing chart, but when it arrived, it cut into my breast giving me what I call the "double boob."  I don't want that!  If I had gotten it any larger, the cups might fit, but it would've been extremely loose around my mid section. Having heavy milked filled breasts makes for a huge need for tight support so I am sadly returning this bra :( I should note that I have two bravado nursing tanks an LOVE them as they are specific to big breasted women. But I still have large cleavage and wouldn't leave the house in them.
4	1395619200	Very comfy and supportive. I love the soft stretchy fabric. Seems to be very well made and I love the option that after I am finished nursing it can be converted into a regular bra ( conversion kit included). I gave it four stars because the side straps on the inside that connect it making it a nursing bra have already stretched out a bit. But it in no way hinders the support after you pull the cups back up. The pink color is nice and soft and pretty neutral. I still have to wear a camisole if I'm wearing white. All in all a very good nursing bra and will be buying more!
5	1395273600	This is the best nursing bra ever. It is very comfortable and looks great under all different kinds of shirts.
5	1395273600	Man, let me tell you, I was totally skeptical about investing in a bra that didn't have underwire. I mean, how on earth would my big boobs get support. I was afraid it would look like the sports bra 'uniboob' or just serve as a practical bra for nursing purposes, but not something I'd be caught dead in.I bought my first one in a store for $5 more than the Amazon price to see how it fit, and I was hooked and bought my 2nd and 3rd from Amazon. To be honest, I'm not nursing yet (still 38 weeks pregnant), but the bra is so, so comfortable, and flattering to boot. So yea there's a reason why the product is highly rated.
3	1395273600	I like how comfortable this bra is. The fact that it is not padded and has no underwire makes it really easy to get the cup out of the way when trying to nurse as well. However, for the same reason, it is not a very flattering bra. The pads inside are perfectly round and give my boobs the same shape. I still use them though because without, it appears I am not wearing a bra, which is worse in my eyes. It's not terrible but if the pads were a teardrop shape or if the bra was lightly lined with padding that would give the bra a better look under your clothes. Without any clothes...well, let's just say this bra is NOT sexy but I guess that isn't the point, huh?
4	1395273600	Inside straps a little loose thus I have to tighten straps more than I would like to be comfortable. Overall, most comfortable bra I have tried so far. Just wish there was a bravado sleep model that felt is if j was wearing nothing... I leak so much that I can't go without at night :(
3	1395187200	After seing all the review I was expecting the best bra ever. turns out its pretty good, very comfortable and supportive but the elastic that holds the strap when the flap is down is way too long. It bunches and sticks out from the side when the the bra is on and while nursing it's so long that the strap does not stay on my shoulder.I got a bravado basic bra from target, it's A LOT cheaper, pretty similar comfort level and fit but that elastic is the perfect length.Maybe I got one that was not well sewn, but at this price i won't take the chance on another one.
5	1395187200	Hands down, this is the most comfortable, supportive-without-being-restictive bra I have ever worn.  Not just the best, nicest maternity/nursing bra, but the best, nicest bra period.  I hesitated spending this much on one bra that I hadn't tried on, but now I regret spending just as much for 3 bras I'll be getting rid of...should have ordered this to start with!
4	1395100800	Love this bra! It's not very pretty but super comfy! I was looking for something with good support, enough thickness to not show nursing pads when wearing a thin t-shirt, and easy to re-clasp with one hand and this is it. A lot of the other bras I tried were way too bulky when I opened them up to nursing but this one was great. And it was comfortable enough to wear all day...it doesn't have that uncomfortable but of wire on the side that ends up digging in. I would recommend this for sure.
4	1395100800	Four stars because the removable pads are somewhat small and move around a lot. If they were bigger they would stay put.
5	1395100800	Comfortable! All the other nursing bras were either too thin / not supportive or extremely uncomfortable.  I heard about the bravado while shopping for a nursing bra at target.  A lady went out of her way to tell me about her bad experiences with other bras and how she finally found the bravado. I am very glad she did.
5	1395014400	I am currently 26 weeks along in my pregnancy and finally had to switch bras, my old ones were beginning to get way too uncomfortable. And I am SO glad I did. This bra is wonderful- stretchy and comfortable yet supportive, I feel like the girls are contained without being smooshed. Keep in mind- it is not the most beautiful thing haha. But it is so comfortable and I'm so glad I bought it. Obviously I haven't had my baby yet, so I can't review it's abilities as far as nursing yet :) but I think it will be awesome for that too. Trust all of the wonderful reviews- this bra is WORTH IT!
2	1395014400	I wear a 38D bra when not pregnant and now, at 7 months pregnant, am wearing a 40D bra. I have always had problems with bras without underwire because they never provide enough support for my breasts. After reading all the reviews on Amazon, I decided to give this bra a shot and figured that even if it didn't provide a ton of support that it at least would be useful for wearing around the house the first few weeks after the baby is born. Unfortunately, I do not think this bra is going to work for anything at all. There are several issues:1. There is NO SUPPORT for my breasts. My husband couldn't even tell that I had a bra on under my shirt. There is absolutely no lift, no shaping - nothing!2. The cup liners shift constantly. I wore the bra around the house one day just to see if it was at least comfortable. I had to move the liners in the cups around when I put the bra on and noticed that they had moved later in the day.3. The cup liners are really issue because the material used in this bra is incredibly thin. This probably contributes to the lack of support, and definitely does nothing to hide nipples.4. The band under the breast cups rolls up when you sit down...making this an uncomfortable bra even just for lounging around the house.I expect my breast to get even larger after I have the baby and my milk comes in. There is no way this bra is going to offer the comfort and support I will need then as it does not do it now. I would never recommend this bra to anyone who is larger than a B cup during pregnancy as I do no think there will be any support if the breasts were any larger.
3	1394928000	This is the second Bravado Body Silk Nursing Bra I've bought and I absolutely love the fit and comfort of these bras! Except, this new one seems to have a defective clip. I've worn it for about a month or less now and the top (of three) clips is bent and frequently comes unconnected. I've tried to bend it back but there's no saving it. It's very disappointing after having paid $55 for this bra and having had no problems with the first one I bought. Unfortunately the return window is past and I'm not sure there is anything else that can be done at this point.
5	1394841600	So comfortable! Great for nursing. Easy to clip and unclip with one hand. Went back and bought a second one.
5	1394755200	Great nursing bra - so comfortable to wear all day and night! I wear a 44C while nursing, and the &#34;XL&#34; fits me fine.  I definitely couldn't take a bra any smaller around the ribcage, so I doubt the &#34;L&#34; would fit me, even though under the sizing guidelines I should be &#34;L&#34;.
5	1394668800	Bra is comfortable and fits well. The size chart was very accurate. The foam cups help hide and protect your nipples
3	1394668800	I was 40 or 42 D pre pregnancy and I followed the sizing chart for the product and found the bra to be too tight. It almost fits but it's tight and would not be comfortable for long. If this is the type of nursing bra you want I would recommend getting the extra large if you are a 40 or 42 D or DD. For women who don't need much support this bra could be great, it is lightweight with soft fabric and the clasps are easily unsnapped with one hand.By type of nursing bra I am referring to this bra leaving the breast fully exposed when you unclip it to nurse with just a small strap laying along the outside of the breast. This does not offer any support while you are nursing. I have found that I prefer the type of nursing bra that has more coverage after you clip it down to nurse like the Silky Micro-fleece Nursing Bra with Lace Overlay.
5	1394668800	I love the fit and wide band on back.  Inserts are easy to take out but give additional leak protection.
4	1394668800	I was a 34A pre-pregancy and this bra actually fits! It is stretchy and doesn't lay weird or bunch under clothing. The pads give it a nice shape without looking 1950s. Only complaint is the elastic feels a little tight under the rib cage, but hoping this will stretch out with more wear.
5	1394582400	I have 3 of these now!  While pricey, they are MUCH MUCH MUCH better than the other nursing bras I have tried.Buy one and you will see they are worth it!
3	1394582400	I don't get all the hype about this bra.  The inner strap that holds it together when unhooked broke after just a few wears.  It's comfortable, but for the money, I wouldn't buy it again.
2	1394582400	I am a 32 ddd when I am nursing so I need a bra with lots of support. This is basically a really expensive glorified sports bra. Its really ugly, smooshes my chest and gives it no lift. If I run slightly my chest feels like it will rip off. It also doesn't give me a very good shape. I was surprised that this bra had such good ratings, the only thing I can think of is that they came from smaller chested women.As far as functionality goes, It is a pain to latch and unlatch because there is a really loose stretchy band that holds the strap to the lower portion of the bra, when I unhook the cup to nurse the hook slides to the top of my shoulder so I have to use two hands to reach up and grab it then reattach the cup. This is difficult because I am usually holding the baby. This possibly is such a pain because my chest is higher and so in order to hold it where it belongs I need to tighten the straps as much as possibly, if the straps were looser then they might not slide up so high when I detach the cup to nurse, but then the bra would give me even less support than it already does.The only redeeming quality about it is that its comfortable, I mostly wear it to sleep in. I think I will try a bra with under wire because this one falls short of everything a bra should do. Yes it is comfortable but so is not wearing a bra, for what it does it is definitely not worth the money
5	1394496000	I love the fact that this bra is sort of a mix between a regular bra and a sports bra.  It provides support, but no annoying underwire!  The fabric is SOOO soft and the nursing clips seem very easy to use.  I also like that it is stretchy material, so it will be able to stretch out when I start to nurse, but then still fit as I wean.
5	1394496000	I love this bra and now own two. It's comfy and fits well. Stretches when needed, such as when breasts are full. Comes with two pads which I haven't used. It's easy to undo a side for nursing even with one hand.
3	1394496000	A bit too big to begin with, (why are there no nursing bras for B cups?) It stretched out significantly over 3 months.  Disappointing as I had good experiences with some of their more supportive bras when I was a D cup.
2	1394409600	I returned this bra even though it was really soft.  Because it is a convertible bra (can be turned into a non-nursing bra), the drop down cup comes down fully and there is just a little string that connects the strap to the bottom band.  It's weird.  I had to return it.
5	1394409600	Just received this today, straight out of the packet and I put it on and am in love with it already. I've been wearing the same two bras throughout my entire pregnancy and at 38 weeks am thoroughly sick of them!! I was a little nervous about the sizing, I'm a 34B pre pregnancy and have only gone up to a 36B during pregnancy, I ordered the medium and it fits fine although I do have the back strap on the last setting so I wouldn't want it to be any more snug. One thing I didn't realize that I am really pleased about is that it came with a convertor pack to change it from a nursing bra to a normal bra once I'm finished nursing, which is great as, assuming I'm not sick to death of it by then, it gives it a much longer life.I like this bra so much I'm about to order several more colors along with the matching briefs. Very pleased.
5	1394409600	Very comfortable, i am pregnant 27 weeks and i start to use this bra because i work all day, i have small boobies, but large chest diameter, always have problems with bras, but this one fits perfectly!!! I will order different colors!!
2	1394409600	This nursing bra is super comfortable but if offers no support what so ever! Also after using it a couple of months it looked terrible. The fabric was balling up and dingy looking, after only 2 months!! For the cost of this bra I did not expect that. I have had cheap bras that looked good after a year of use.
2	1394409600	I wanted a few better quality full figure nursing bras, which are hard to find; however, the sizing runs very small so even the largest size wouldn't fit.
4	1394323200	Before we got these my wife was complaining daily.  Must be pretty good because I haven't heard any more complaints.  Converts to a regular bra too if you want she tells me.
4	1394323200	Great bra, very comfortable! I usually wear a 32D and the small fit perfect. Glad I made this purchase and I would definitely buy another in the future.
5	1394323200	This bra is very comfortable and supportive. I ended up ordering another one in a different color. I was worried about getting the right size so I thought this might be able to help others:Pre-pregnancy I was 155 lbs and 5'4&#34;, wearing a 36B. My breasts never got bigger while I was pregnant.3 weeks after delivery and I am at 180lbs and my breasts have only gone up about a cup size. I ordered a medium and it fits great!
5	1394323200	I bought this Bra before I would need it for nursing to make sure I liked it. I'm 28 weeks pregnant and wear this Bra almost every day. It is EXTREMELY comfortable, including to sleep in. It won't win any awards for sexiness, but gives a very nice shape underneath shirts, etc. Pre-pregnancy I was a 34B, but currently I'm a full 36C. The medium size nursing bra fits perfectly. I will be buying at least 1 or 2 additional Bravado silk nursing bras when I start nursing.
5	1394323200	I am currently 37 weeks pregnant.  Regular bras and sports bras are so uncomfortable for me now.  Someone mentioned getting a nursing bra already.  After searching and reading reviews I chose this Bravado Body Silk nursing bra.  It is so comfortable!!  I wasn't sure if it would fit okay, since I'm normally a small 32A but the small fits great with some room to spare :)  Only only complaint is that the bra comes a bit high on the breast so you really need to wear a high neck shirt.  Other than that I love it and look forward to using it during nursing!!
4	1394236800	I really like this bra, but there is a downside. I love that there is a soft padded cup, but on the other hand, the padding seems to come undone a lot - especially when breast feeding and I have to constantly re-adjust the padded cup. With that said, the pros far outweigh the cons: the pink color is really nice, it fits well, and like I mentioned, it has a padded soft cup which makes it very comfortable. I'll probably buy another just because I've bought different nursing bras, but they're a little too thin and don't have the padding.
5	1394236800	Fits like a glove.  Had an old one and did not realize how much it had stretched out.  Even my husband noticed.
5	1394236800	Awesome fit and so comfortable. Love it! Definitely the best nursing bra I have purchased. A little pricey or I would have a few more.
2	1394236800	This would be a great bra if it actually fit, it is at least two cup sizes smaller than described.
5	1394150400	Just ordered my second one cause it's all I wear these days!  Comfortable to wear at night and looks &#34;put together&#34; enough to wear when I'm out and about.  My cousin randomly bought the exact same bra and loves hers as well.
2	1394150400	I am larger chested, a 40DD, and this bra offered zero support. It was also much too small even though I ordered according to the size chart. It was very comfortable and I would've kept it for a lazing around the house bra, but not for the money. It really did nothing at all for me.
4	1394150400	I am a 34B pre-pregnancy which fell into the Small on the sizing Chart. I put that it fits somewhat small because I have the rib band in the last hooks so there is no room to grow there. The bra fits perfectly in the cups at the moment which means if I grow anymore, it will be too small. I am 21 weeks along, first pregnancy, but I imagine I will grow more?? I might try ordering a medium but am afraid that will be too big since I fall into the smallest measurements for that one. I do LOVE the material and this has been way more comfortable than my normal bras. I agree with other reviewers, the foam cup inserts do get messed up when you fold them down for nursing position, but I like them still because I can wear this like a normal bra. I will buy another one.
5	1394150400	This is a great T-shirt and all around bra.  I wish ALL my bras fit this way.  But just to be clear, I wear size small and was about 100lbs before I got pregnant.
5	1394064000	Love everything about this bra! This is the third type of nursing bra I've tried and I'll never wear another. The snaps are super easy to do one handed, the band at the bottom is comfortable and doesn't roll no matter how many hours you've had it on, and the extra pad in the nipple area helps cushion sore girls while not broadcasting the weather to everyone! Actually have three of these (black, white and red) and would highly recommend them!
5	1393977600	I love love love this bra. It did not look as good as the photos but trust me it's the most comfortable bra I'v ever wore. I wish I could find this bra for my pregancy back then. Still it's a perfect one for my breastfeeding. Another reason I love it is because the material is super comfortable for me since I have really sensitive skin. I would like to purchase more for sure.
5	1393977600	This bra is so comfortable! I like the fit and it has great snaps. This is my favorite nursing bra. I highly recommend it.
5	1393891200	I love this bra. This is the most comfortable nursing bra that I have by far. I also have it in pink and will probably order it in additional colors. I love that it has removable pads for days that we venture out of the house. I am not fond of my nipples showing through like they do on so many other nursing bras. Love, love, love! Well worth the price.
4	1393891200	I love that it comes with and you can put padding in the bra for leakage. There is not much support and I don't think they are supposed to go into the dryer. One that went into the dryer started to fray very quickly there after. Of all the nursing bras that I have tried - this one is the most comfortable. They prevent heat rash under the breast with the way they fit and I do not get internal breast water deposits like I do with other nursing bras. it would be 5 stars if the first one I bought last a bit longer - after the dryer incident. The support strap unraveled like a ribbon. I have not had any issues with the other two I bought shortly there after and am keeping them away from the dryer.
5	1393891200	I have been struggling to find a nursing bra without underwire that I can use the few weeks before birth and once my baby arrives. Most of the options on the market really look and feel like a sports bra, something I'm not a big fan of. This bra, however, is comfortable and give you the shape of a normal bra, while still meeting the requirements (no wire & ready for nursing). A friend recommending this bra to me and I will recommend it to you.
5	1393891200	This is my favorite nursing bra so far. It has plenty of support even though it is wireless. The fabric seems to be a quality fabric that holds its shape. The clips are secure and don't come off on their own (like with some other cheaper bras). The band is wide and supportive (3 hooks). The removable cups don't bother me or make the bra a funny shape like other reviewers had mentioned but that could be because my breasts aren't that large and so the cups cover them better than larger breasts. I will be buying more of these!
5	1393804800	This is a really nice comfy bra. Fit is great and I can wear it 24 hrs (both for daytime and nighttime support).
5	1393804800	My daughter is 9 month old and during that time I've tried many bras. None fit as well as the Bravado. They are comfortable, hold well and adapt to the expansion and reduction of the breasts due to breastfeeding. I have it in 5 different colors. I recently purchased the bravado nursing tank top. It's as amazing as the bras. They're perfect to wear under winter clothes or while traveling.
4	1393804800	This nursing bra is great. I highly recommend it. It has a very wide ranging sizing chart - I ended up needing a large instead of a medium. That could be because of my personal preference for it not to be too tight. Either way, Amazon return shipping was great and I was able to order the Large in quick fashion. This bra has a lot of adjustments, multiple snaps in the back and adjustable straps. It fits very comfortably and is not itchy. The cups are easy to unhook for nursing and it has enough give to accommodate fluctuating breast size. I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because I wish this bra was cotton, or at least partially cotton, so it was more breathable.
4	1393804800	I have personally found it difficult to find a comfortable nursing bra. This fits similar to a sportsbra. It gives great support and is seamless, the should strap clip is big and uncomfortable. Even so, it is the best nursing bra I have found.
5	1393718400	I just ordered this bra in two colors based on the excellent reviews. My baby is still a week or so away from being born, so I'm not sure how the bra will feel once I'm nursing, but so far I am very impressed! It is so comfortable ...no itchy or pokey parts to it. Nice, thick band in back for support which also helps hide those unsightly bulges gained during pregnancy!
3	1393718400	My pre size was 34b.  In my last trimester and when I delivered and my milk came in, a medium would have been perfect. Once established, my nursing size is now from 36b to 36c. I was in between sizes in the size guide, so I went bigger like they recommended. I should have gone smaller. The pads included are how everyone says. Just remove them. Super comfortable bra. If you size up, there is a weird wrinkle look on the outer fabric on the cups when you remove the pads. If you are 36b or 36c go smaller!
5	1393718400	I love this bra. So much I ordered a second. This is my fourth baby and I've hated every other nursing bra I've owned. This is soft and supportive even for larger busts.This was worth the money. I wish I'd ordered two different sizes though as by the time I got the second one (a week after delivery) my rib cage was smaller and I could have gone down a size.
5	1393718400	I have been holding out on buying a nursing bra until the final month of my pregnancy. I measured at a 34D (used to be 34B) and feel there's some room for growth when my milk supply comes in with ordering a medium.  I heard awesome things from others about Bravodo bras.  They weren't lying.  Wow.  It is so comfortable and it now my every-day-go-to bra.  Obviously I have not yet tried it for nursing, but imagine it will work beautifully.  I plan to purchase at least 1-2 more.  When I read previous reviews, the major compliant was the wrinkling of the fabric.  My bra was like that for a day, but with wear, seemed to smooth itself out.  Maybe you have to get the size just right or the strap/band adjustment?
5	1393718400	I really hate going to buy brasiers. But I had to buy this for breast feeding in a shop in my town. It is so good that purchased a second one on Amazon. It fits perfect, the plastic clips are very resistant. I will keep using it after breast feeding
5	1393718400	The most comfortable nursing bra I've purchased so far!  I'm six months pregnant, so I haven't used it for nursing yet, but I wear one of these bras almost every day.
4	1393718400	Good fit. Straps a little tricky.  Didn't realize I had to put it together myself. Expensive, but a quality bra.
4	1393545600	The sizing guide is way off. Just wait till your milk comes in and then order it. Seems like it would be very supportive and comfortable though!
5	1393545600	The fabric is so smooth and comfort to fit in. No wonder why it's always get the good reviews. Must try for all mom.
1	1393372800	It is my very first amazon.com review after being an amazon shopper for two years. Coz I feel I HAVE to write it so you can be alerted that this is NOT safe to wear!!I brought the Medium, Ivory one.When I received the package, I was very happy as this item has 4.5 average rating and all those good reviews besides it looks to be very well made and designed. The size fits well.But it gives such terribly strong disinfectant-like smell ASA I merged it into just the tap water, just water!! ( I have the habit to rinse all new clothes (: )ASA I merge it into the tap water, just water!, it gave such strong disinfectant-like smell that I could hardly bear.Even at that time, I thought it could be just the manufacturer took extra steps with strong detergent to make it super clean and safe. I then rinsed it for at least four times and the smell NEVER go away! The foam pads do NOT have the smell, just the bra fabric!! So it is definitely not my tap water.I then started to think it thoroughly, how much detergent could they have used to clean it that can make the whole bra/fabric have such strong smell?  And Why should they do that?For all new clothes I have brought and rinsed in my life( I am 30!), this is the ONLY one has such smell!The bra looks brand new. But WHY should they do that?The only possibility came across to me is that it is a returned one and it has some kind of problem. To make sure it is &#34;clean&#34;, they have had to merge it into some very strong detergent for quite some time!! The regular detergent can be rinsed off easily after 2 times!I have called amazon to return it already. Will NOT consider this brand anymore!!To me, NO one should EVER sell any clothes like that! Especially it is a nursing bra for mom/ mom-to-be! I cannot bear the thought that this was supposed to be used for nursing!! That a baby may touch it!!Please, for your own safety and your babies', find another nursing bra!
4	1393286400	it's not VS but it's the comfiest nursing bra ever with good nip coverage and a magic band that stretches as you grow and shrink.  there are cuter bras out there, but you can always get the tiger stripe version
5	1393286400	I love these bras.  The padding is enough to absorb leaks yet still look normal.  The clasp makes it easy to access the breasts for feeding and release easily.  The sizing is great because it accommodates the fact that breast size can fluctuate quite a bit in the early days of nursing.  I've actually bought 4 of these because I like them so much better than the ones at Motherhood.  They also don't have any pesky underwire which feels like torture when you are already sore.
4	1393286400	Great at home bra. I am a 38E now and it does not have enough support to wear outside the home. It is easy to use and extremely comfortable.
5	1393286400	I was at the point in my pregnancy where my regular bras were feeling too tight, and I didn't want to have to buy bras in different sizes every few months at my body changes.  I love that these bras fit multiple cup and band sizes.  They're SO comfortable.  It's almost more comfortable wearing one than not wearing one.  I think the small will fit me all the way through my pregnancy.  I may have to go up to a medium when nursing (we'll see).  The clips seem easy enough to hook and unhook.  I'm not using these for nursing yet, but I definitely plan to in a few months.  :)
5	1393286400	This really is such a nice fitting, easy to use bra. I love it! It's convertible for after nursing too.
1	1393200000	This bra is Smaller then what the sizing indicates and it is not a good bra for large busted women.
5	1393200000	The sizing chart was true to the actual size, the bra performs the way it is supposed to.  The bra is comfortable easy to use and I recommend this product.
4	1393113600	I wear a 38C normally and have bumped up to a 40C/D while nursing, so I ordered a medium per the size guide.  Unfortunately the bra is too small both around and in terms of cup size.  It feels and looks super comfortable, however, so I plan to return and order a large.
5	1393113600	This is by far the best nursing bra I've ever had. The fit is amazing, the material is so soft but it keeps it's shape. The back band is wide enough that its a smooth fit on my back. Because the foam inserts in the cups are removable, they tend to slide around when you fold it down to nurse. However, its still worth every penny!
4	1393027200	I really like how comfortable this bra is. I am on the larger side of the fit guide for the size I bought, and it is just a tad bit small. Overall, I really like it, though. I like the removable pads and the ease of hooking and unhooking for nursing.
5	1393027200	SO comfortable, soft & supportive! Definitely beats Medela & You Lingerie brands. I can wear this bra day & night.
3	1393027200	I bought this bra when I was still pregnant hoping to find a bra that would fit now & later. I have worn it with several shirts and it doesn't create any unwanted outlines, which I was worried about. The bra was comfortable for maternity.  It feels small now that my milk is here. I would order a size up than your normal pre-pregnancy bra size. The most annoying thing about this bra is its not easy to maneuver the snap with one hand.
4	1392940800	This bra is awesome at first, it fits comfortably and is easy to BF in. Loved it so much I got 2. My one complaint is that they stretch out bad, so if you are ordering be aware after about 2 months it starts to not support that well. Overall I would buy again but get a size down.
5	1392854400	Love the bra, I had 2 already so I knew what I was getting before I ordered.  It's very comfortable to wear all day and to wear to bed, washes up well too.
5	1392854400	Comfortable as expected! No underwire, adjustable straps and back to fit body as it changes! I love that I can remove the pads and insert my own, as the ones it comes with are very round and a wierd shape.
4	1392854400	I like this bra and it's very comfortable but it doesn't have as much support as I need. If your cup size is D+ you may want to look for something with more support (Soma makes my favorite, very supportive, under wire nursing bra). I use it as a lounge or sleep bra and love it for that purpose.
5	1392854400	I'm only in my first trimester but I have very sore, swollen breasts. I bought a cheaper maternity bra at Target and it is nothing compared to this. I feel supported and I don't notice any pain while I'm wearing it. And it's nice and smooth under clothing. This is a must buy for any pregnant woman. I'm going to get another!
5	1392854400	Finally a nursing bra that fits, is comfortable and supportive without underwire, and I don't sag like a grandma! I was so excited when I put this bra on.  It fit perfectly, and gave great support without uncomfortable underwire.  The extra pads added a bit much, but that is the only very small flaw I could find in this bra. I am definitely going to order more and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great bra.
5	1392854400	I love this bra!  It is comfortable and supportive for me.  I only wish the straps were wider at the shoulder
5	1392854400	I decided with this pregnancy to splurge on a nice nursing bra and I'm so glad I did!! These are incredibly comfortable-I sleep in them even. I'm about a 34c right now and med fits well. I got ivory from a lactation consultant and then ordered black from amazon. Same quality but less expensive. Well worth the money.
5	1392681600	Love this bra.  It was recommended by my sister.  It's comfy enough to sleep in, keeps me covered if I'm going out during the day and doesn't pinch me at all.  It's as easy as wearing a sports bra.  Highly recommend getting these
3	1392681600	Ordered this bra to have something to use once the baby arrives. Still 6 weeks from due date however the fit is a bit loose at this point. I am normally a 34A and have gone up to a 34B during pregnancy and, with the padding still in the bra, it is loose in the bust. I ordered this bra in order to accommodate any fluctuations in size but did not expect it to be too big. Hoping i'm able to fill it out after the baby arrives.  Both the cups and band seem a touch larger than a normal bra. Otherwise, the fabric is soft and stretchy and appears as though it will be comfortable, if I ever grow into it.
3	1392681600	Definitely not for smaller chested women... I'm an A, but a large B/small C when I nurse... The small still was too big. I wasn't impressed by the material/padding... So dissapointed!
3	1392595200	I like the fit and look of this bra, and it's comfortable, but I would not buy again. I got this bra as well as 2 of the Basics by Bravado brand bras (Bravado's line for Target), and I like the Basics by Bravado ones much more! They've all been through the same amount of wear and tear, and the Basics ones are holding up much better! This body silk one is pilling and threads are coming loose right and left. The pads are useless because they've become permanently wrinkled and indented, which you can see through clothing. The Basics bras are in great shape, and they were less than half the price! It seems weird that Bravado would produce a higher-quality product for Target versus the other way around, but that seems to be the case! I wish I had saved my money and not purchased this bra; I could have gotten 2 more of the ones I actually like from Target!
5	1392595200	This bra is so comfortable I sometimes forget I'm wearing it! It feels like my nursing tank without the bulk of fabric around my belly. My favorite part is the straps stay up. The straps on most bras constantly fall down on me which frustrates me to no end. It's so annoying having to constantly pull straps up with baby and toddler in tow. I love this bra!
5	1392595200	This bra fits perfect.  Would recommend this to friends and family.  This bra does not dig into any places like under the breasts or shoulders.  I love this bra!!!
5	1392508800	I am very pleased with this purchase - I have not been this comfortable since before the pregnancy. The material is soft and moves/breathes well during the day. It is truly seamless and I am holding my breath that it will be as functional as it needs to be once the feedings begin.
5	1392508800	It's the PERFECT fitting , most comfortable almost invisible feeling sort of sensation kind of Bra!!!So in LOVE with it
5	1392422400	Awesome fit, closest to the support of a real bra!! I wear the nursing tanks too but I wanted the fit of a bra and need to dress more professional at work.
5	1392336000	The nursing bra is what I had been looking for, a nursing bra that is easy to wear and the material soft.
5	1392336000	Very confortable. Feels soft and secure. Exactly what I was looking for. May even buy it in more colors. I was a 34 dd during pregnancy and Medium size fits perfectly!
4	1392336000	This is a comfy and supportive nursing bra. The only complaint I have is it runs a bit small in the cup. I'm a DD cup size and I ordered a Large as the chart suggest for DD but I still spill out the top of this bra(especially when breast are full).  Aside from this l love that this bra comes with inserts to hide nursing pad and the clips seem sturdy.
4	1392249600	still waiting for the baby to come, but this by far is the most comfortable bra I've worn...  the hook, we will see how easy it is to pull on and off for feedings... but really comfy!
5	1392249600	I had always worn underwire until having my daughter---I got one of these shortly after having her, and then went and bought another. They fit well and are very supportive and comfortable. The two I had have held up very well for 2 years, and I just bought 2 more! I highly recommend these to other pregnant and nursing mamas.
5	1392249600	I have a 5 month old and I am still breast feeding and hope to continue for a while. These are super practical. Easy to snap off when you have to breastfeed or pump and it is absorbent enough so there are no milk leaking accidents. I don't even use my breast pads because these do the job just fine.
5	1392163200	This bra gets five stars for fit and comfort. The material allows for your changing size throughout the day and gives great support!
5	1392163200	This brand was recommended by a friend and after having no luck finding a good nursing bra I was willing to try it. The best part to me is that this bra is sized S, M, L, etc instead of a specific bra size. My size has been changing non-stop since becoming pregnant and its nice to have a bra that fits at all times. It is comfortable and keeps my shape well despite not having underwires. The only downside is that I can see the insertable cup outline through some tighter shirts.
3	1392076800	This is a great nursing bra.  It is very comfortable and has no underwires.  However, the sizing runs small.  I wish I would've known that beforehand and I would've ordered a size larger.
5	1391990400	This is the best and most comfortable nursing bra ever! I tried a bunch of them and this is by far my favorite. Every nursing mum should have at least one. Just like the other reviewers said, I didn't like the inserts so I took them out.
5	1391990400	Very comfortable nursing bra. I just ordered more of these. Fabric is soft. Fit very well with my cup size.
4	1391990400	This is a very comfortable bra. I'm heading into my 29th week and the fit supports gently. I ended up ordering an XL because the L was starting to be a bit too snug.
5	1391731200	Easy to wear, easy to wash, easy to feed the baby. Had bad sternal pain during pregnancy, and this was the only bra I found that didn't hurt to wear. I was a 34B prior to pregnancy am now probably about a 36C/D. The large is very comfortable.
3	1391731200	2 of the 3 clasps in the back broke off after one wash.  I can still wear it with the one middle clasp.  I would advise to wash it on gentle and don't dry it!
4	1391731200	Prior to being pregnant my usual bra size is 34 B, then later on in pregnancy I had to wear a 36 B. I purchased this bra in small and the first time i tried it on it seem to perfect fit. However, when I wore it the whole day at work, it felt too tight around my ribcage and made it hard for me to breathe. So I ordered another one in medium, it gave me more space around the ribs vut the cupsize was too big. Ir wpuld have been better if they offer this bra in more specific sizes like regular bras. Still its a very comfortable bra and i just had to buy bra extenders for the small.
5	1391644800	Very comfortable fit! I have tried a few other bras and none for as well or are as functional as this one.
5	1391644800	Wow, I needed to order this as soon as the baby came. I tried other nursing bras from Target but had to keep returning because they were so uncomfortable. Even though this has no-underwire, I still feel supported. I'm about 5'3&#34;, 145 lbss, C cup pre-baby and about D-DD post-baby. I ordered the medium and it fit well though I was on the outer most bra clip. I just love love love how comfy this bra is to wear. Only negative is that the &#34;dip&#34; in the cleavage line is a little high on shorter torso individuals.
4	1391558400	I bought this and a few other nursing bras at the same time to try them out. I read all the reviews and actually ended up keeping all of them for different reasons. (Mamajamas easy bra, You! Lingerie sexy nursing bra, and this one) This one looks the best under my clothes, and is very supportive, but the band around the chest is a little tight. The cups fit perfect though. I am hoping once I have the baby, that part of me will shrink up a bit, so it will be a little more comfortable. I like the little pockets for the nursing pads, as well. This is a great bra and I'm sure it will get a lot more use in the coming months.
5	1391558400	Bought a whole batch of nursing bras as I approach my due date. They were all freakish and uncomfortable except for this one! I liked that the entire bra is stretchy and the band and straps have a lot of adjustability. Seems like it would be comfortable enough to sleep in. Light padding keeps smooth profile under t-shirts.
5	1391472000	I am using it during my third trimester.  It's perfect!  It is slightly more expensive than other bras but I am tired of buying several bras and NONE can keep me comfortable for long during my pregnancy.  Due to the changing hormones etc my body shape has been change constantly and what was comfortable became uncomfortable shortly.  This nursing bra is very &#34;flexible&#34; in size yet offers enough support.  I haven't washed it yet - I hope the integrity and support still holds after washing!
4	1391385600	It is hard to buy bras, especially nursing bras online but where I live I have to drive a few hours just to go to one store with limited selection.  Because I have a larger band to cup size ratio I do not find that S-M-L sizing is ideal but I bought this one because it has the adjustment on the back.  It is similar to a sports bra style but it has hook closure on the back and removable padding.  The clips are a little higher than most of my bras (which is a little inconvenient but I've gotten used to it).  Without the padding the cups are a little baggy but okay with nursing pads.  I figured I'll just wear it without the inserts around the house.  My nursing pads do show through a little if I wear a snug/clingy top, but if I'm going out I can put the foam inserts in and it looks great.  I just don't like having them in because they shift around as I nurse all day and I figure I'll just get them creased and deformed, so I save them for going out (when I worry what I look like/ if I figure I'll be taking off my coat).  The band hooks on the back are a little loose on my 34 frame in the loosest position.  Brand new from the package I prefer it on the second row of hooks.  Support is okay.  I wouldn't wear it for working out/running/ jumping/ I don't feel fully supported when I run up and down the stairs at my house.  I think if I had bought the size small the cups and probably the padding would be too small in circumference for my chest. I'm 5'8&#34; tall and have a larger frame.  Hope this helps
5	1391299200	I ordered this early in my pregnancy, b/c my boobs grew so quickly. Sometimes, I even sleep in it for comfort and support. I am 5'4&#34; 125# in my 5th month, normally a full C. No idea what size I would be now in a &#34;normal&#34; bra, but I wear a Medium in this one. Definitely recommend. I've washed it, dried it, worn it constantly, and it still looks new.
4	1391212800	My only concern is that while the padding can be removed, if you would like to keep it in, it will make it look pretty fake and not naturally shaped. If you take the padding out to see how it is shaped, it looks like a circle versus triangle. A triangle padding would offer smoother profile look and feel to show chest naturally descending down as oppose to form ridgit and uneven profile. I tried moving it up and down and eventually if you moved it high enough, it can make things a bit more natural looking, but then bottom of chest has a lack of padding coverage. Oh well. Overall the size small fits well, although a bit tight at least in the begging for a typical 34 B.
5	1391040000	I have been on the hunt for a good nursing bra and one to wear for my last few weeks of pregnancy. I bought one from Target and it was TERRIBLE! I quickly returned it and ordered this one. It is seriously the most comfortable bra I  have ever put on in my life. No joke.  I highly recommend this to all the Mamas out there. I am going to get another!
4	1391040000	Fits great! This is a Quality bra! I'm a B-C cup and it works great for me.  it might not have the support needed for larger sizes. Nice, soft fabric.  I recommend getting more than one.
5	1391040000	I love this bra! It is comfortable but still has the support I need while nursing.Since it is a little stretchy like a sports bra:1.) It's more forgiving for times that you might be fuller than others.2.) It's comfortable enough that I wear it at night.3.) It's not too rigid or too tight nor does it pinch in the under arm area like other nursing bra's tend to do.Please don't misunderstand though, the stretchy aspect does not mean it is loose. It is comfortably snug and fits well. I also love that it comes with little loops so that you can convert it to a regular bra post breastfeeding if you choose. You just take the little plastic snaps off the top and replace with these loops and voila, a regular bra.
5	1390953600	i have purchased several other cheaper nursing bras.  this one fits the best and is the most comfortable while still allowing for east of nursing.  it also converts to a &#34;non nursing bra&#34; after you're done with that stage in life!  love it and may buy another!
2	1390953600	The fit of the bra was accurate, but I ordered this bra for the light padding and it is unusable for me.  It is too curved and it looks like I am obviously wearing some sort of nipple shield.  It may be a breast size issue - smaller breasted women may not have this issue.  I am a 34DD when pregnant or nursing.  Otherwise the fit was fine and it is very comfortable, but I really wanted a foam cup to hide pads etc.  the one in this bra is small (like a couple inches diameter) and totally doesn't fit the natural shape of my breast.
5	1390867200	I haven't actually used this to breastfeed yet (I'm due in 6 weeks), but I want to comment on the shape and fit.  I was a 36 b/c cup prior to my pregnancy (depending on the cut and brand of bra) and am now a 36 D.  The medium fit perfectly.  I typically like bras with underwire, but read that it can inhibit milk production, so I took a gamble on this hoping it would be comfortable yet still supportive.  It was very comfortable and quite supportive!  It didn't make my breasts look saggy or flat at all!  There is quite a bit of padding in it, but I think this makes the bra shapely and may be nice for hiding nipple pads and any leakage.  It is the kind of nursing bra you'd feel very comfortable to wear out of the house.  Some other reviewers said they removed the padding, so that seems to be an option too.  Like I said, I haven't used it yet so I don't know how well it will work when I am actually breastfeeding, but it seems promising and I expect that I will be able to wear it as a normal bra even if the breastfeeding doesn't work out for me.
5	1390780800	Fits wonderfully!  This is the brand and type of bra I have worn for about 3 years now, I'm not sure what Im going to wear once Im done nursing and or not pregnant!
5	1390780800	So soft but very supportive...and flattering!  I am not breastfeeding anymore but I bought another because I love the, so much.  Allows you to change it to a regular bra when breast feeding is done.  So nice to sleep in too.  I looks attractive on too...flattering to the figure.  LOVE.  I am a 34 D and went up to a 36 E...bought a medium and it fit me the whole time my body was changing with pregnancy, postpartum, breastfeeding, etc.
4	1390694400	Just received it.  Was skeptical about ordering online, but fits great! It's really comfortable.  I will definitely keep it.  Can't wait to start using it!
5	1390521600	Provides support and is very functional. I am a size 34B and got a small. I am very pleased with this product.
4	1390521600	This is a super comfortable bra (for its price it better be)!  I am a size 32C pre-pregnancy and I ordered the small and it's comfortable and I can use the looser hooks if my chest gets larger.  I'm 23 weeks pregnant so I don't know how this works as a nursing bra yet but as a maternity bra it's great (of course it's not the cutest thing, but right now that's not really my concern).  The instructions on converting the bra into a nursing bra are a little confusing but I've got some time to figure that out :)
3	1390348800	I bought this bra because of the reviews, but I'm feeling like it wasn't worth the money.  Pre-pregnancy I am a size M shirt and 36C bra size...so I bought a large thinking it would be big enough for my post pregnancy chest, but I've had the bra on for about an hour now and I'm ready to take it off!  It seems tight and now I'm contemplating exchanging it for the XL.  From other reviewers...ppl who bought the XL were in a size D-H, so I don't understand why it's so snug!  I am 35 weeks now and if my chest gets any larger (which I'm sure it will), there is no way this bra will fit!  This will be my first Amazon purchase that I'm going to have to return and I'm disappointed because I have already spent almost $50 on it already!  I bought a similar bra at a local store on sale for $15 and I could honestly say that the cheaper bra was much more comfortable even though it didn't offer as much support.  The one thing I do like about the Bravado bra is that it is v-neck, so if I wear a lower cut shirt, it will not show through.
2	1390348800	The xl was too small. The range should be broader and a xxl would fit a lot of nursing mothers. Was satisfied with the comfort of the seamless, it was just too small.
4	1390348800	Super comfortable! The padded feature conceals leaks. A better than average nursing bra. I think this bra runs true to size.
5	1390262400	I love the material, and it's very comfortable compared to other nursing bras I've bought. Looks great under shirts as well.
5	1390262400	This bra is the most comfortable nursing bra I've tried.  A little pricey, but you get what you pay for.  I liked it so much I bought a second one.  It also looks great under your shirts.
4	1390176000	Very comfortable bra with great support (for smaller ladies). Small fits as I hoped and I only wish I had more of them.
4	1390176000	This is the most comfortable nursing bra out there. I've tried on and actually own a number of others and keep returning to this one. That said, it's really ugly looking. And, as other reviewers have noted, the pads just sort of move around inside the bra. It's a pain and I wish it looked better, but I can't argue with the fact that this is very comfy.
4	1390176000	I have another of these bras that I've been wearing in my last weeks of pregnancy -- haven't nursed with it yet. However the one I ordered from Amazon has a broken clasp, so I need to return it. I would say this bra deserves 5 stars for comfort. I'm giving it 4 because the one I received was defective, though this would be the fault of the manufacturer.
5	1390003200	This bra is amazing.  I had very sore nipples after beginning nursing.  This bra felt great.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a nursing bra.
3	1389916800	It's great for smaller breasted women. It is functional & easy to use the clasp with one hand. However, I felt too squished, & part of my breasts 'over filled' the cups and it looked tacky. The cups are thin & even though the have pads that are removable when you put on a shirt you see them. I'd imagine it'd be the same if wore breast pads. I'm a 42 DDD. so it's extremely hard to find one that comfortable. If you got big boobs the Bravado brand isn't for you.
1	1389830400	I looked at the sizing guide and I was on the smaller end of XL, and when I put it on both my boobs seemed to be heaving out either side of it. The clips kept unhooking while I tried to put it on, and don't seem very sturdy or reliable.I wear a size 44 DD, and I just got done returning my Motherhood Maternity order because they were too small also. I went into the store, and tried on bras at Motherhood Maternity and had the clerk give me the right size to order based on that.I don't know if online items just come smaller than they are in store in general for bras, but no thanks to these stupid companies that don't care to follow their own sizing guides I'm down to just one bra. I'll stick with Fancee Free because at least they fit right. It just sucks because their plus size bras are all discontinued.
4	1389830400	Since I'm usually a 36DDD (36F) I prefer a bra with underwire for added support, but when first coming home with baby the underwire can be painful, so I went with this bra on my sister's suggestion.  Provides more support than I thought it would and is very comfortable to wear.  No itchiness in the fabric or straps at all.  The clips are easy to maneuver as well.
5	1389830400	Only worn a few days but I already want more in different colors. This is the most comfortable bra I've found in a long while. The fit is perfect. No bulging on sides or top, no falling out if I bend over, and no underwire jabbing my ribs. They even send conversion straps to change from nursing to a regular bra. I couldn't be more pleased.
5	1389830400	It fits very well and it's very comfortable! I've tried so many different nursing bra brands and this is so far the best. I'm glad I've finally found a good nursing bra!!
4	1389830400	This bra is soft and comfortable but doesn't provide lasting support for larger breasts (38D). The strap that stays connected while the nursing cup is down is flimsy. Cozy if you're looking for an at-home only bra.
5	1389744000	Out of all the nursing bras that I tried (38B postpartum), this fit me the best. They are super comfortable and well-designed - the cups that are included not only hide your nipples but also do well in hiding leaks. The way they are designed allows you to nurse without much obstruction. I wish I could afford to buy more.
4	1389744000	Fits well, very comfortable and functional. I will definitely be ordering more. Great quality nursing bra, worth the higher price!
5	1389744000	This is my first nursing bra and it fits perfectly! It doesn't feel bulky and clips/unclips really easily. The color is spot on as well. Highly recommended.
5	1389744000	Great bra!!! Very comfortable. I really liked the Medela bra without underwire until I tried this bra. My new favorite!!!
4	1389744000	VERY Comfortable nursing bra. The cups move around a lot though so they often aren't where they should be, especially after washing. Only used a couple months before it started pilling around the edges and showing significant wear.
5	1389744000	Loved this bra with my first baby 4 years ago, needed a new one, and this one fits even better than the first! I use this bra during and after pregnancy, and it is so comfortable but also supportive. It has a thin removable cup pad that helps to conceal your nipples, a wide band that does not roll under the breasts, and it is easy to snap/unsnap one- handed for nursing. Love it!
4	1389657600	I'm still expecting, but needed to size up in my bras pre-partum. I've tried several and this is my favorite. It's by far the most comfortable. The straps stay in place and they give my chest a nice shape. I specifically wanted a bra with padding that I could wear out since I'm not even nursing yet and this fits the bill. Haven't started nursing yet, but the clip seems easy enough to snapped and unsnapped one-handed. Only drawback is that it's a little snug around the band. I was a 34B before getting pregnant and think I'm about a 36/38C now (haven't been measure or fitted to know for sure. The cup size is right, but the band is a little on the tight side. Waiting to order more to see what size I am post-partum, but will likely be buying this bra again in some other colors!
5	1389657600	This is by far the most comfortable nursing bra I own! The fit is nice and supports like a bra with underwire (without the pokey bit)! Very comfortable and it will now be my everyday bra. I will have to buy a few more of these just so I can have it to wear all the time!!
5	1389657600	This was definitely the maternity bra I have been looking for in terms of support and coverage as my chest area grows. I have not tried out the nursing capacity yet but I'm confident it will work out well! THANK YOU for this product!
3	1389484800	I am a 38DD. I bought this for sleeping (no where close to enough support for daytime!!)Anyway the bra does not help to keep your breasts contained. I avoid wearing this bra at all costs.The bravado double plus are a much better sleeping bra
5	1389398400	I have been searching high and low for a comfortable yet supportive nursing bra. This bra not only is comfortable enough to sleep in but it provides fantastic support for my ever growing breasts. I am a 32DD while nursing and the size small fits perfectly. Size chart seems to be accurate and package arrived quickly. I have already ordered another one. The fact that it changes to a regular bra when your done nursing is just icing in the cake. I would highly recommend!!!
5	1389398400	This bra is super comfy and it was my go to bra when nursing.  I would definitely recommend this bra!
5	1389312000	This isn't a normal online purchase for me, I like to be able to feel and try on something like this before purchasing. But going from store to store in order to try on bras 2 weeks before my due date is not going to happen. I bought this bra in a small and medium. They both fit me, the small a bit more snug and the medium with a bit more room. The material is stretchy enough that either size is comfortable right now, and I think that helps in keeping everything where its supposed to be. I'm keeping them both because I'll need the bigger size the first few weeks of nursing.I didn't think the padding was a problem with this bra. I left it in. Its not bunchy, it doesn't show, and its not uncomfortable.I bought the butterscotch color, which is close enough to my skin tone to not be visible under white shirts.
4	1389312000	This nursing bra is very supportive, fits true to size, is comfortable, and it has the padding so you don't have any headlights showing. Honestly, I think all bras, especially nursing bras, should have padding because we don't need to be seeing any headlights.
5	1389225600	I am larger chested, but not big framed.  I wear a 34dd, and I  bought this in a size medium.  I wore these bras when nursing from the first day post partum through nursing my 18 month old.  So, I lost all the baby weight, and could still wear these without having to change sizes.  The band has four size options, so I just go wider or looser and tighten the straps.  Somehow the cups molded to the changing shapes of my breasts.  Now that I'm pregnant again, I also find them comfortable for maternity wear.Not super sexy.  Lift is good though, but if I'm going &#34;out&#34; I choose something with an underwire.  But, considering it has no underwire, I find it unbeatable for support and comfort.
5	1389139200	Finally...the perfect bra for my giant nursing boobs. Great support but not tight.  Super comfy. Easy to nurse with.I want to buy 10 of these!
3	1389139200	The padding in this bra was too much. When I took it out you could see too much. It is a good bra for sleeping at night but I cannot wear it during the day.
5	1389139200	Love it! It is so comfy and soft. I've been wearing it all the time now! It also provides good support. Going to order a couple more!
5	1389139200	I didn't expect to love this bra as much as I do. I already have the Calvin Klein Seamless bra (which is the most comfortable bra I've ever owned-- I wear it every day)-- so I thought it couldn't get any better. This bra is almost as comfortable as the calvin klein- with the added benefit of extra cup support. I feel like this holds me in a bit better than the calvin klein. I wear this to bed, and have never had any issues with fit. I think I will buy at least 1-2 more before the baby arrives. So glad I found this bra- thanks to all the great reviews by everyone else!
4	1389052800	This is not THE best nursing bra ever, but I'm still quite happy with it. Maybe not quite as supportive as I would like it to be, but very very comfortable, which is great. I like that it is adjustable and adaptable and I think it will be great for both wearing under clothes during the day and also for sleeping in. The sizing was accurate as described and I would definitely buy it again.
5	1388966400	Upon first opening the package I thought that the bra might be too small but after trying it on it had plenty of elasticity and stretch while still retaining lots of support. It has an extra wide band in the back that helps smooth my lovely mama rolls and makes it feel comparable to a high quality sports bra. I ordered a nursing sleep bra from La Leche at the same time as this one and this bra is actually much more comfortable to sleep in. Too bad it's 3x the price. If I had endless amounts of money I'd have this bra in every color.
5	1388880000	I bought this bra because I can no longer wear underwire bras (my baby bump gets in the way).  It is supportive and comfortable. We'll worth the money.
5	1388880000	I love the quality and thickness of the fabric. I took the pads out because they made my breasts look a little misshapen, but I didn't want pads anyway. The bra is very comfortable and easy to snap/unsnap to feed my 3 week old. I also like that the fabric doesn't stretch out after a couple wears. I'll definitely be getting more of these bras!
1	1388793600	Let me start by saying that the bra is comfortable.  I bought it because the underwire ones I had were really digging in under my arm, and this bra definitely solved that problem.  However, I do wish I had read the reviews because it does not support your breasts at all.  The women who are in these pictures must have rock hard boobies, because there is too much give in this fabric to support the girls adequately.  Also, once unclipped the side of the bra is just an elastic band, essentially an extension of the bra strap, so the clip does not stay in place and can not be reattached with one hand(and they are flimsy and unclasp while you are putting the bra on.  Because you are pulling away the only method of support once you unclip that front panel, your breast immediately sags.  I personally prefer the types of nursing bras that have a fabric &#34;hole&#34; encircling the breast for more support while nursing. Overall, it is an ok bra for around the house and sleeping in, but I would not recommend it for every day use.
5	1388707200	Basic but comfortable fitting bra. Good shape, feels like a comfortable sports bra. Would buy more if they had more colors.
5	1388620800	I was skeptical to purchase a bra without trying it on first, but I have to say, this is the most comfortable bra I have ever owned.  I put it on, and it instantly melded to my body -- amazing!  I have since ordered two more in different colors.  The nursing latch is easy to take on and off with one hand, and I just love how stretchy yet supportive the fabric is.Just a note that the generic sizes provided by Amazon are NOT correct for this bra, so you need to refer to Bravado's size chart (others have posted in their reviews).  I am a 38C right now, and the medium fits perfectly.
5	1388620800	This is the best fitting nursing bra I have worn so far.  Very comfortable and a great material.  Very pleased.
5	1388620800	I love this nursing bra.  It is nice and warm for the winter, provides appropriate support, and the cups are very soft and comfortable. It was definitely worth the money.
5	1388534400	This bra is comfortable and flattering for the final stages of pregnancy and early stages of nursing. As you wear it it contours to your body and you almost can't feel it at all, but gives great support. I will order another of these.
4	1388534400	This fits well and is comfortable. The padding sits a little weird but I've never had a padded bra before. I will probably just remove it. I think the bra is a bit expensive too.
4	1388448000	First bought this in a Large for the first few weeks after delivery, and it's a bit big now in the band so I purchased one in medium. Band size is great, but cup size in the medium is too size for me right now. Love the material and the shape this bra provides, it is definitely my go-to bra and is even comfy enough for sleeping in!
5	1388448000	Sooooo comfy! Bought 3 more. Really love love the colors. Makes me feel girly and pretty! Jester red is my favorite. This This my 2nd kiddo and I had had a heck heck of a time trying to find support and a bra I can wear comfortably  the the first time. Spent way too much money on bras that did one one or the other.
5	1388448000	I was a little hesitant to pay this much for a bra, but I have tried several less expensive nursing bras that I wasn't happy with . This is the best bra I've tried and well worth the money.  I love it!  It's a very comfortable fit and the fabric really does stretch and move with you.Bra straps tend to slip off my right shoulder, but I don't have a problem with this bra because of the way the straps are connected to the back.  It also has removable padding in the cups, which prevents the &#34;headlights&#34; from showing.  It also means the bra can be worn with or without nursing pads discreetly.  The cups are easy to snap and unsnap with one hand, unlike nursing bras I've tried from other companies.  And, even with the cup in the bra, it still falls easily away from the breast while nursing.  This is a big deal to me because other nursing bras that I've tried didn't do this - I would have to roll them and tuck them into the bottom of the bra.This is such a great bra that I'll probably keep using it even when I'm not nursing anymore.
4	1388361600	This is my second baby, and I am so happy I found this bra this time around! Total comfort for lounging around at home. Love.
5	1388361600	So, I'm a planner... When I became pregnant I stocked up on bras from &#34;Destination maternity&#34; because at 4 months pregnant I was no longer able to fit into my regular bras (36C) and was only getting bigger - The largest size I purchased from DM was 38DD, and this was before my milk came in... Lo and behold, once LO came my DM bras were no longer fitting the bill: Very uncomfortable (underwire and rough), and trying to fold the breast flaps down was extremely awkward.  I purchased several other brands with prices all under $20 - I was very hesitant to spend even more money after spending a small fortune on previously purchased DM bras.  Of course the less expensive bras just didn't work - no support and flimsy.  I figured I'd give the Bravado bra a try... After purchasing the first one, I've purchased 4 more and will be purchasing more in the future. EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE, EASY TO DETACH BREAST COVERS, AND AS A BONUS - IF IT PEAKS OUT FROM YOUR SHIRT = LOOKS LIKE A CAMI!!! Yes, I'm in love with these bras. Well made, comfortable, easy to care for, and easy to breastfeed in.
5	1388361600	I've been having a hard time adjusting to my growing body, i'm 6.5 months pregnant & my old bras have been incredibly tight/uncomfortable. This is by far the best bra i've ever owned! It's like wearing nothing all day, & it doesn't cut into my skin.
2	1388275200	I have 3 pea in a pod seamless bras and I love them. Decided to try the bravado because of the good reviews and I still prefer the pea in pod. The material is very soft (I give it 2 stars for that) but the cup has a very weird shape, like a ball. And it runs smaller than the pea in a pod.
5	1388275200	Most comfortable nursing bra I ever owned. If you are looking for sexy this one should not be on the list. However, it earns an A+ for functionality, comfort, and accessibility.
5	1388188800	I am only 5 weeks pregnant with my first child. But my boobs are already getting bigger and heavier and really sore. Pre pregnancy, I was wearing a 34DD but bulging out the top of the cups just a little. I ordered the Medium.  I measure 29&#34; just below my boobs and over the top I am 36&#34;. I always have a hard time finding a bra that keeps the girls from touching the skin on my abdomen just below my boobs. I really hate the skin on skin feeling - especially in summer when I'm all sweaty. With this Medium bra on the smallest set of eye hooks and the shoulder straps about half way tightened, this bra does a pretty good job of holding the girls up. It's not a complete uniboob look however It is really, REALLY comfortable! I should have plenty of room to expand with the Medium. I plan on buying a couple more of these!
5	1388102400	This bra fits great and is very comfortable.  It's definitely worth the money and it is my favorite nursing bra.
4	1388102400	I like this bra more then some of the others I have for nursing, it has great support and no show through. I only have 2 problems with it. When you wear it with the cups inserted it gives your breasts a strange shape - at least from some angles. Also, when you pull it down to nurse if you have the cups inserted they bunch up under your breast a bit. Otherwise I like it a lot.
5	1388102400	Bra is quite comfortable. I like the padding I the cup - it does make the Bamboobies less noticeable under clothing. I plan to purchase another.
5	1387929600	OMG after months of outgrowing bra after bra and none of them being comfortable, putting this on is like heaven!  It's the comfort of a sports bra without the smushed boob look of one.  Couldn't recommend it more.  I'm currently a 38 DD and the large fits great!
5	1387843200	Love the product, ended up buying a second. Easily adjustable and very comfortable. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nursing bra.
5	1387843200	I tried on so many nursing bras in several stores, each time leaving empty handed. I read so many reviews praising this bra that I decided to order it and hope for the best. I really like it! I haven't had my baby yet but I've worn this bra to try out all of the features. It is very comfortable-- more comfortable than the sleep bra I bought. The removable cups have great shape and fit easily into a pocket in the bra so they stay in place. The nursing clips can be undone and refastened with one hand. The bra seems to give support and looks smooth and shaped under my shirt. I'm very pleased and I'm sure I'll be ordering more of these if I am able to nurse (and maybe even if I'm not!). My only wish is that this bra came in white or nude. I ordered the ivory which turned out to be light yellow. I normally wear Victoria Secret 36B and bought this bra in a large. It fits but I'd on the snug size brand new. Hopefully that helps someone with sizing.
5	1387843200	I've never written a review on anythign before.  I have ordered 5 different nursing bras and this is the first I feel like I can wear all day and it doesn't move and it's so soft and comfortable.  I am returning two others and just ordered two more of these.  Finally happy with a bra.  I am a 34 F normaly and I ordered a Large, it's very stretchy so I think I will be fine with it even if I grew another cup or two.  AND it is PADDED, stretchy and padded is hard to find.  wearing today with a lightweight sweater, and can't see any lines.  Pads are removalble though if you don't want them.  LOVE IT!
4	1387843200	The nursing bra runs kind of large for a 36A/B currently, but hoping to fill it out when breastfeeding actually occurs. It's well made and with quality material.
4	1387843200	Pretty good bra nice and comfortable. Works well around the house and for even sleep at night .  Also nice it coverts to a reg bra later
3	1387756800	I washed before use but it still got a plastic smell.  Hope the smell will go away after the second wash.
5	1387497600	Love this bra, new mom to nursing and after trying one other nursing bra I knew this was the one for me. I now have 4 of them and wearing full time!
3	1387497600	cup size too small im not that big around but  boobs  real big. bra is nice and soft well made
5	1387411200	Ordering online is often difficult so I only purchased one of these bras at first but after using it I came back to buy more. These are incredible and easy to use, making breast feeding a breeze!! I'm a 38DD and the xtra large is a perfect fit.
5	1387411200	I would recommend this bra to nursing moms.  Love the material and comes in multiple colors.  This bra allows for nursing pads to be worn without any problems.
5	1387411200	According to the size chart, I should have gotten the medium but I went with small thinking medium might be too loose as I am pretty small frame. I am 34A pre-pregnancy and at 34 weeks, my cup size went up to B and my rib band went up to 38. Considering that my rib cage will shrink after the delivery, I went with small, which was a good choice.  Small still gives me some room to grow and fits great. I've tried several maternity bras and this is the one. I am planning to replace all of my maternity/ nursing bras with this one in different colors. Worth every cent!
5	1387411200	This bra really is a comfortable as they say.  I was really struggling to find something that would be comfortable, and provide support: Bingo!  I also tried the 'Cake Lingerie Maternity Nursing Luxury Seamless Cotton Candy Bra', but it had to be put on over the head, and I had an easier time pulling it down over my legs to get it off - not so great for easy on-and-off after a C-section.  The Bravado Body Silk Seamless Nursing Bra clasps in the back, and comes with removable cup inserts for added nipple coverage, and leaks.  It's just as comfortable when the removable cups are out.  It has a deeper v-cut, too, so I could wear more shirts with it (eg v-neck t's).  This really has been a lifesaver!
5	1387411200	I originally purchased one of these bras when I first delivered. I love it so much I purchased two more so that I could wear one while laundering the others. The instructions specify air drying the bra -- I have accidentally put the first bra in the dryer on two occasions, ones on low heat and ones on regular high heat. Still fits well, so my guess is that so long as it is not habitually dryer dried, it should be fine.
5	1387411200	I absolutely love this bra. I'm on my third child and have tried every bra there is, including the previous Bravado versions. They either were uncomfortable or didn't give enough support. This one does both and it is actually flattering on the body, I wouldn't go all the way to sexy, but much better than their previous designs!
4	1387152000	I bought these in a medium and a large not knowing exactly where I would fall.  I'm 5 months pregnant now and probably a 36 D or DD and seem to be growing still.  The medium works on the last hook and the cup size feels good, but I've kept the large since I'm still getting bigger.  I figured I can wear the mediums after or get a hook extender.Good construction, not too bulky, but keep things where they should be.
5	1387065600	It comfortably fit before I became engorged and comfortably fit during engorgement and comfortably fit after, now that I'm in the swing of nursing. Excellent fit and easy snaps. I love that I can convert the bra when I am done nursing as well. I have 2 of these bras and that is all I really need.  Wash one, wear one. I handwash and line dry. I love the inserts that come with it also, an extra bit of leak protection, along with the washable nursing pads I use. I love the fit, the fabric, the color, the ease of use....excellent bra.
3	1386979200	I wear a 36DD and bought size L.Cons:It fits, but definitely creates a "uniboob" for me and the bottom part folds under my breasts. To me this is annoying and uncomfortable enough to wear it only when other nursing bras are in the washer. This might be a problem of sizing, and maybe going down to a size M would have resolved the issue.Pros:Material is soft and very comfortable.Easy to open and closeRoom to grow in when the milk comesHas great inserts, which I use also in other nursing brasIn the end it's all about personal preference. I find a thinner fabric and underwire more comfortable.I sleep with the Medela sleep bra and like Anita microfiber nursing bras with underwire the best for daytime use (with the bravado insert to give more coverage).
5	1386892800	Couldn't find a better gift for the young mother.My daughter is really happy with her new bra. The great thing about it that she could wear it even after she finishes nursing.
5	1386806400	I was skeptical at first, but when I tried it on, the bra fit great and felt more comfortable than the nursing bras I currently own. It's easy to use when nursing, I can definitely hook and unhook one-handed. Will be buying more of these, it's definitely worth the investment!!!
5	1386720000	Very comfortable bra. I would highly recommend it to any mother who is breastfeeding. You will need the disposable pads but after trying so many bras out - this one is definitely my favorite.
4	1386720000	I just tried the bra on and it fits comfortably and feels smooth.I need to continue to use it to see how it holds up.
5	1386633600	Great bra for pregnant and nursing women. Alittle pricy but they are well worth it and give the support and comfort I need.
5	1386633600	Great for sleeping in & for wearing during the day. I noticed other reviewers mentioned the small straps on the side when you release the cup. It stretched out a bit for me, but, when the cup is secured, you can't tell. I've been using for 2 months now & haven't had any issues. It looks like it will hold up fine, but I'm gentle with it just to be sure....
5	1386547200	I Love this. I can sleep in it. It is easy to use and easy to clean. Would highly recommend.
5	1386547200	I read tons of reviews on Amazon before buying this item and bought it because of many positive feedbacks. I'm pregnant and all of my bras became too small for me. My only concern was what size to buy. My regular size was 36B and I used the size table and ordered a Small. I can say it fits perfectly for me now - very comfy, I don't feel it. However I'm afraid it may be small after the baby birth, since there's no room to grow, so I ordered another one in medium size as well. This bra is rather costy but it's really very comfortable and I think it is worth its money.
5	1386547200	Bravado is my favorite nursing bra! I've tried various other brands and this is by far the must comfortable and flattering!
5	1386547200	This is a great nursing bra, especially if you're not sure how you'll fill in and want to have a bra ahead of time in the hospital.  I am full-cupped at 36G and this bra is great and offers really good support.  I LOVE this bra and am so glad I ordered it ahead of time.  Two of my concerns that were alleviated by purchasing this bra:1.  Finding a good supportive bra without underwire -- I'm sure you've read breastfeeding mamas should try to forego underwire, but as a 36G, do you think I'm going to leave the house without underwire?  Uh, no!!  But when this bra arrived, I was impressed with the support and how my shape looked in it.  The shape is natural and there is padding that can be removed.  (I leave the padding in and add a set of Bamboobies on top of the fabric.)  This is by no means a push-up bra, but I would have no issues wearing this bra to work and out and about.  Additionally, this bra also happens to be my go-to at home because it is so comfortable to wear and lounge in.  With my old bras, I would always get home from work and immediately take off whatever iron maiden contraption I had on that day, and I never slept in any bras.  Since not sleeping in a bra is no longer an option (waking up to a puddle isn't my idea of a fun morning!), I am so glad I found this bra, I can wear it 24/7 and sleep in it and I don't get uncomfortable.2.  Finding the right size of bra --  As a first-time mama, I wasn't sure how my breasts would change, but I wanted to be prepared before my little one arrived.  I am a 36G and have a hard time finding regular bras that fit in my area to try on, let alone nursing bras.  I ordered a size L and am very happy I did.  During the week my milk came in and the engorgement phase, I could have maybe gone up to the XL, but the fabric is so soft and offers a generous stretch, the size L was fine and now that my breasts have leveled out, I'm glad I went with the size L.Side note, there is a wonderful lactation department at my birthing center, the women are serious pros and all have 10 years of lactation experience each.  I noticed they carry a single style and brand of bra: this one!  I have ordered three bras total and will continue to re-order while breastfeeding.  The bra also comes with a conversion kit to turn it into a regular bra after you're no longer breastfeeding your child.
5	1386547200	This is a very comfortable bra.  I had to purchase a second one because I wanted to wear this bra and not the other nursing bras I had purchased.
4	1386460800	I like that it's soft and has padding that prevents my nipples from sticking out.  I don't leak so no need for nursing pads, but don't like nursing bras without padding because of the nipple issue.  Also it's got pretty decent shaping. I only wish I could do hands-free pumping with it...
4	1386288000	This bra is super comfortable and great to sleep in.  The material is very stretchy, so if you want to wear after nursing and are in between sizes, then I suggest getting the smaller size.  The bra comes with clasps to turn this into a non-nursing bra afterward.  My only issue with the bra is that the molded cups that come in and out often fold over when I am nursing, and when I flip the whole bra back up, the molded cup stays folded over and I have to mess with the inside pocket where the cup is to get it flat again.  I don't want to do this in public, so I wear it mostly at home.
5	1386288000	excellent. This bra is very soft and matches well. i've introduced to my friend and she loves it as well.
5	1386201600	I have recently had my second daughter and have tried many bras with this child and my older one, I didn't like any of them. Then I found this bra and I love it. I wear it 24/7 and going to buy it for my friend who is expecting.
4	1386201600	I like this nursing bra. However, it gets pretty loose after a few months. I also wish they make bras in cotton.
4	1386115200	I have ordered several nursing bras. I'm a 40e or 38ddd. This bra is my favorite so far. I'm able to wear it to work. It's not the most supportive but any nursing bra wolothoit underwire is going to be a little less supportive.
5	1386115200	I love these bras.  I have tried other brands, but these are the most comfortable, easy to maneuver with one hand, and flattering.  The removable pads are great to leave out when at home or use with fitted shirts for modesty purposes.
4	1386028800	True to size. I am a 34DD and the Large felt great. I have to say: these are the best because they last. I have 2 pair that I rotated for 10+ months and the elastic is just starting to pull in areas. It should be noted, however, that this is bra is not as flattering as underwire bras, none are.
4	1385942400	I'm not totally sold on this product but don't really having any other bras to compare to. Seems flimsy on the support. Wish I could find a nursing bra that is attractive and has good support.
5	1385942400	Wish I would have ordered a size up-- still works. Consider your current cup size and potentially going a cup size or two when milk comes in. Very comfortable and prefer to sleep in this versus actual sleep bras.
5	1385769600	This bra is super comfy and melts to your body and the back design supports the back very well! A must buy!!
4	1385683200	I bought this and followed their size chart and it's still a little short to fasten. I just use a bra extender with it instead of buying a new one. Cup wise it's perfect and out of the 3 kinds I've tried, it's my favorite nursing bra. Can't wait to get a few more!
2	1385596800	I read all the reviews including magazine articles that recommend this bra. However it's not for those of us with larger or heavier breasts. According to the size chart it will fit me, but once I tried it on things were bulging in all the wrong places. It lacks enough support and creates no shape.  It's like being without a bra at all.  I am going to keep it because it will suffice for sleeping, and keeping the breast pads in place during sleep. But it's definitely not a bra I will wear outside the house.
5	1385510400	i had many recommendations from friends to buy this bra, and its true! so comfortable and easy to wear, i love it!
4	1385510400	I ordered three of these bras, one medium and two large for varying milk levels.  They are so comfortable, I cannot stress that enough.  That said, when I unhook the cup for feeding, it rolls back up unde my daughter's mouth and she gets frustrated.  This us with the pad in, btw... It might stay put without the pads.  So I ultimately pull the whole bra up instead of using its design as intended.These pads are well-contoured and can be used in sleeping bras, as well, without any seams
5	1385510400	I am expecting my first baby so I wasnt sure what to buy. A friend recomended me this bra so I ordered it and wasnt sure what to expect. It fits great and still has room for when I have my baby and I need a bigger bra.
5	1385424000	This one is comfortable and fits very nice! I think that I will be able to use this bra long time after nursing
1	1385424000	It itches! I've been wearing it for two weeks straight; it looks like crap, it itches, and it's not nearly supportive enough. Also, it's smaller than I thought it would be. For $45 this did NOT live up to my expectations.
5	1385337600	I have boughten 2 of these bras now and love both of them. Honestly can even wear them to bed if I want.
5	1385251200	Purchased two of these bras after baby arrived. They are extremely comfortable and worth the money. I chose a size up from what was suggested and am happy that I did. I'm used to wearing underwire bras and these offer the same support minus the wire. I even purchased one as a gift for a friend who is expecting soon.
3	1385164800	I wanted another Bravado Original Plus but the local store didn't carry black and the saleswoman talked my husband into this instead. Ostensibly, the small fits through my size [32DD] but doesn't really seem to be meant for it. First off, the molded cups appear designed for an A or small B cup, are shaped like a half sphere rather than a human breast and don't stretch to accommodate larger cup sizes. Due to the lack of structure between the cups, regardless of the padding I use, I get more of the sports bra look with an absurd amount of cleavage. I can deal with this from time to time but soreness from lack of support means this stays in the drawer more often than not.
5	1385164800	Okay, I'll be the first to admit that when shopping for nursing bras I bought several from destination maternity/pea in the pod that were pretty and stylish looking.  They were reasonable comfortable pre-delivery too.  This bra though has been hands down my favorite post-delivery and I have ordered four in total.  It is supportive without being constrictive.  Other bras I was wearing had smaller bands around the torso and ultimately cut off my milk supply.  I can't praise these enough.  New moms may be shocked at how quickly you end up leaking through a bra and needing to change so buy several bras so you're not doing laundry all the time and use breast pads.
5	1385078400	Really excellent bra. Super comfortable, easy to nurse with, looks good, and gives a great shape.  Also looks good under clothes, and hides disposable breast feeding pads well - gives a very smooth look. So good I've bought five in various colours!
4	1384905600	It is very comfortable. It looks good too. It is exactly what I was expecting. I will order more soon!
4	1384819200	Super comfortable and easy to unhook for nursing. It was also comfortable to sleep in, with plenty of coverage, which is not true with all nursing bras. Only con is that when milk leaked on it (I used nursing pads, but during feedings some milk may get on the bra), the fabric would dry hard. Overall a great bra though!
2	1384819200	Fit great and was very comfortable but made my chest  look strange shaped in a tighter shirt. I would either take out the cups completely or add different ones
5	1384732800	I ordered this bra when I was pregnant with my third child. I never had a bravado bra before and was a bit apprehensive because of the price.  Needlesstosay, I'll be buying another one! I have since had my child and have been using this bra. It is comfortable, practical and flattering.  I also used it while pregnant and it was a great bra after I had outgrown my regular bras as the pregnancy progressed. I have bought many cheaper bras and they aren't worth the money or discomfort.  I highly recommend this bra!
5	1384732800	I love these bras. I was completely miserable and engorged after having my daughter. NOTHING fit! I put one of these bras on and it was heaven! I don't normally bother writing reviews, but I felt obligated this time! :-)
2	1384473600	I returned this item because it was to big and I also didn't fill like it was supportive enough even in a smaller size. Would not recommend for large chested women.
5	1384473600	Love this bra,  I think it is a must have fire nursing. Very comfortable and machine washable which is great because I don't have time to hand wash anything with a little one.
2	1384473600	Before pregnancy, I was a 32DD. Now, just a few weeks from my due date, I am a 36G. I ordered this bra in a large and, although it fits, it's not supportive. My breasts are heavy at the moment (they will only get heavier once the milk comes in) and the band provided no support. I feel like my breasts are quite droopy in this bra. I was somewhat disappointed as I read quite a few reviews as to how supportive this bra was for larger breasts. Plus the padding inserts arrived crimped and wrinkly. They gave an odd shape to my breasts so I removed them.Since I had this shipped internationally, it's too much of a hassle to send it back and pay shipping all over again.I did buy another maternity bra (Anita Women's Summer Nursing Bra) and it has by far been the best bra that I've worn during this pregnancy.Anita Womens Summer T Shirt NursingIt's incredibly supportive due to thicker straps and underwire. It's sold buy your actual cup size - not S, M, L, XL. It has the feel of the Victoria's Secret bras that I wore pre-pregnancy and it gives my breasts a nice lift.
1	1384300800	Trusted the reviews and got this bra - it is awful. It is not seamless and the is silicon heap on top of the bra like you don't have enough to carry around.
3	1384300800	Wife seemed to like it. Showed up and worked as expected. She had these for a previous pregnancy and liked the way they functioned.
5	1384300800	OH MY GOODNESS. A bra that fits and feels wonderful. I am currently pregnant and am in heaven wearing this bra.
1	1384214400	After two week of use, the bra strap snapped.  For a bra at this price point, I am extremely disappointed.  The manufacturing quality is just not where it should be if there are defects of this nature.On the positive side, Amazon issued a full refund immediately which was greatly appreciated. Excellent customer service!
5	1384214400	I didnt like the look of this on the computer, but when I got it, it is the best looking bra ever! Even compared to regular bras! love it! no more worrying about lines/seams/bunching/nipples and all the problems that go with nursing moms boobs! yeah for this bra! totally worth the money!
5	1384214400	As a larger cup-sized woman, this bra is great.  Comfortable, no digging into skin or sides, and it is really durable.  I just had my third child, nursed with all three, and I still have one of these bras from the first child born five years ago.  Really holds up through washings and daily wear and worth the extra money.
5	1384128000	This bra is very comfortable, it has a great design, and offers just enough support.  Its easy to use with one hand.
4	1384128000	Ordered this for my daughter, who was looking for a nursing bra with more coverage, and it fits great.  She really likes it so far.
5	1384128000	The bra is comfortable to wear during the day or overnight and comes with removable pads.  It also comes with two styles of front hooks so you can choose which is easier to use with one hand.
5	1384128000	The bra gives a good support and very comfortable. I like it. Even if it is not used for the nursing, it is a good choice!
5	1383955200	Love this bra... fits perfect and unlike some other nursing bras i've tried they hide nicely under my shirts (no sticking out on top!)
5	1383868800	This bra was more comfortable than expected and offered padding in the cups, which I was seeking.  Very comfortable to wear all day.
5	1383868800	Under wire nursing bra's were pinching milk ducts and gave me blocked duct problems. Ouch!Not the case with this one! I have cup E breasts while nursing my son, and this bra has been my lifesaver. This bra is super comfortable, but also supportive enough to wear through out the day. The material is very breathable.One thing I didn't originally like about this bra is the clasps. They look like cheap crap, but they are surprisingly resilient to the normal wear and tear of daily use. I'm giving this 5 stars because of comfort and support - this bra does its job.Also, it may just be a fluke with one of the bra's, but the left strap is slowly unraveling on my dark plum colored one, and I've had it for barely 6 months. I don't want to alarm anyone though - my other two bravado body silk seamless nursing bra's haven't had any issues. Its just my dark plum colored bra.
5	1383696000	I tried several nursing bras and this one has been the best. Very comfortable and is supportive even for dd cup size
5	1383696000	i didn't really expect the sizing to be right... but it was. it fits really well, provides plenty of support, and the fabric is really comfortable. whenever i go out, i always make sure to wear this bra.
5	1383696000	It's good for nursing moms, comfortable, prevent leakage of milk and keep clothes clean. Easy to open up by one hand when breadfeeding.
5	1383264000	I had bought a nursing bra from the mall already but they did not provide the support i needed. However with the bravados the support is there and is as comfy as can be. loved the fact that i can easily pull the flap down with one hand while holding my little one. Will definitely recommend!!
5	1383264000	This bra is more expensive than others but well worth it. It has extra padding which helps if you constantly leak like I do. It is very supportive and comfortable.
5	1383091200	I am so glad I found these bras -- they are comfortable, soft, well-fitting, and well made. They wash up in the washing machine nicely too (I even accidentally dried one once, and it was still perfect). I have this bra in black and nude, and between the two I really do not wear anything else!
4	1383004800	I'm a 36B or 34C and I got the medium and it fits perfectly. Don't go by the chart. The small would have been too small for me and that was the recommended size for me. Thankfully I had already got a medium as a gift so I knew the medium was the size I wanted. These bras work great. Super comfortable and easy to use. I have 3 of them! :)
4	1383004800	Comfy and good quality! I can see this stretching easily as my boobs fill with milk after baby comes! Good support and coverage too.
2	1382659200	I'd had high hopes for this bra, considering the price and star rating.  I received it as a present, and am now in the process of trying to find out how to return it.  As a large-chested woman before getting pregnant, I went with the XL as it was the largest size available (it claims there's a XXL, but I've never seen one offered); however, even a XXL wouldn't have fit.  I couldn't hook it on my own to even try it on - I had to ask for help.  The absorbant pads glowed through the very (VERY!) thin material.  I was popping out of the bra in essentially every direction!  There is utterly no support, and you get the proverbial "uni-boob." The hooks/snaps to remove the cup from the strap require two hands, made a loud popping noise that had me worried they were breaking, and were even more difficult to reattach than remove.There was very minimal packaging as well.  The bra was in its plastic box, which was placed inside a thin plastic mailing bag.  If the bag had been punctured, the bra would've been ruined.  I wasn't even given a recipt, invoice, etc!  (Which is why I'm having so much trouble finding out how to return it!)On the up side, the material was soft and the straps didn't dig into my shoulders.  But that's about it.If you are a women who doesn't absolutely need to wear a bra, this might work nicely for you.  For anyone else - I'd suggest looking for something else, especially for the cost of this bra.
5	1382659200	After trying on several nursing bras I felt most lacked comfort. As soon as I tried this one one, I knew it was a winner. Extremely soft, comfortable and supporting this had quickly become my favorite nursing bra. It's seamless coverage hides my breastpads well.The snaps are easy to unhook and quick to resnap together.Some reviews mentioned how the pads do move around a little when you bring the cups down. This is true but I've been able to move and fix the pad is a few seconds so I do not see this as a problem.If you're looking for comfort and function, I highly recommend this bra.
4	1382659200	I really like this bra. Very comfy. And it's really kind of pretty. Most nursing bras I've found for bigger girls are not very sexy. This one is!! I don't feel like I have a nursing bra on. The straps are the only thing that bother me. They fall off my shoulders and they are kind of hard to snap closed with one hand. But I overlook those a things because its comfy!! :-)
5	1382572800	This is pretty much the most comfortable bra I've ever worn, and I'm hoping it will grow with me as I start nursing ;) Definitely worth the cost.
5	1382572800	This bra is so comfortable...The size is perfect and I bought two, one in butterscotch, another one in black....I love them both!!
4	1382486400	This is one of the most comfortable nursing bras I have tried.  I like the soft inserts and that the band doesn't stretch out so it will continue to fit properly.
5	1382400000	I  was a size 40DD before pregnancy, but now my breasts are often engorged and tender due to breast feeding.  I like this bra because it has removal pads.  I leave them in to conceal the cotton washable breast pads I wear.  I've had a problem with other bras that were thin and showed the circular shape of the pad through my shirt. I did not want to spend a lot on nursing bras, but these are well worth the cost.
3	1382313600	I was really expecting to like this, based on the reviews and the photos. The bra IS comfortable to put on. However, the shape is bizarre. The reason why all of the photos show models with perfectly round breasts is because there is actually a soft cup in there. I never have trouble with the shape of my breasts when wearing plain stretch bras. The cups on this one were too small, however, and basically, my shape ended up looking like I had half of a hollowed out orange on the end of my breasts. It was similar to an ill-fitting bathing suit cup in terms of appearance; the line where the cup ended was very noticeable, and it just made my breasts look tubular with a round end (instead of just round, which his how they normally are!). If you are smaller chested, then this is probably a great bra! My normal bra size is a 34F (or 34DDD in American sizing) so if you are anywhere near that size, I would recommend going with one of the Anita bras. Very disappointing, since this bra was such a pretty pink and it was comfortable to put on!
5	1382313600	This is a very comfortable bra. Easy to use for handsfree pumping and feeding baby. I will use this even after I no longer breastfeed.
5	1382227200	Excellent for nursing discreetly. Very comfortable for all day wear. Washes well. In love it. I recommend it highly to all body types.
5	1382227200	Love it! I bought one at a store a couple months ago and decided I needed another. It's the best maternity/ nursing bra out there. Pricy but worth it.
5	1382140800	This bra is so comfy and offers great support. I just ordered another one I love it so much! I highly recommend it.
3	1382140800	The inner padding collapses downward when attempting to tuck it underneath my breast.  It's obviously inconvenient and time consuming to try to fix it in proper place, especially when you're already out in public.
5	1381881600	I never buy any other nursing bra (I have also bought other bravado makes). These last a long time (through three kids) and are so comfortable. Easy to wash.
4	1381881600	Around the 4th month of pregnancy, my regular bras began digging into my skin, so I wanted something seamless and comfortable. This bra doesn't give a tremendous amount of lift comparatively, but since I was primarily looking for comfort and basic support, I wasn't disappointed. The material is soft and stretchy. I usually wear a 36 D or DD and the Large fit perfect.
5	1381795200	All I'm seeing now is recommendations for bras, breast pumps, and baby clothes. It has pretty much ruined my Amazon account. She reports the bra functions properly though...so I guess there's that.
4	1381795200	I love this bra!  I can resnap after feeding with one hand, and it's super comfy and feels very supportive!
4	1381795200	It seemed like a very comfortable bra and slightly padded which is nice. It was way too small - needed 1-2 more inches around.
4	1381795200	These bras are great!  I gave it 4 stars only because the shoulder straps could be a little wider for added support for a full figured bra, despite that one of my favorite nursing bras.  This is my fourth child, wish that I would have had these bras with my previous babies.
5	1381708800	This nursing bra is my favorite!  After breastfeeding my first 3 babies, and buying lots of other bras...If I had only known about the Bravado Body Silk!!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE mine!  I could throw all the others away except for these (I own 4!)  I am a 36/38E.  I actually have 2 LG and 2 XL.  I wore the XL for pregnancy and when my milk first came in, and the first 8+ weeks.  Now I am mostly wearing the LG which I felt was too tight a couple weeks ago.  They are my go to bra!!  Just the best in my opinion!Some ladies complained about the foam inserts folding...Yes, they do IF you don't have nursing pads on the INSIDE of the bra.  Try it out before throwing the inserts away!  The inserts are great for hiding nursing pads/nipples. I wash my Body Silk in a mesh laundry bag and line dry.  Looks like new after 3-4 months!By the way, Amazon is cheaper than the Maternity sites I've looked at.  No, I am not paid to say so...But I am a very happy customer.  My friends are impressed too with their great new nursing bras (YEAH, BRAVADO!!).
1	1381708800	I ordered this one based on the reviews and on the &#34;seamless&#34; in the title.....this has nothing seamless...is so uncomfortable and the sizing is not accurate!
4	1381708800	I really enjoy this bra. My one slight complaint about it (and it's slight) is that when I release the cup to breastfeed, the hook ends up high on my shoulder and I have to dig in order to find it and reattach the cup. Otherwise, very comfortable and fits well.
5	1381708800	Its a beautiful color and the material is soft to wear. Since the padding can be removed, its perfect for bustier women (like me). The only thing that could have improved it would be the option to add a strap extender so that it is more comfy at the rib cage
5	1381449600	I am pleased with this bra, I ordered it along withLeading Lady Women's Underwire Padded Seamless Nursing Bra, Nude, 40D. I really had no idea what size I was going to be- pre-pregnancy I was 38C, and now I am bustier. I ordered the XL and it fits great, I am going to return the other bra and order another one of these. It is so comfortable that I can wear it all day and then sleep in it. I do recommend this bra.
2	1381363200	I wasn't find if this bra. I went with the size chart and based on my bra size of a 32 F I ordered a medium. It was a tiny bit too small at the top of the cups, causing some spill-over. A nursing bra should never be too tight since that can lead to a plugged duct or mastitis so I am returning this one. Also really didn't like the shape it gave me. The soft cup inserts made each side small and rounded at the ends. Very weird shape. The shape without the inserts was different but not any better. : (
2	1381363200	36 DD here.  I bought a large and was really disappointed. Although it is a very soft bra, there is almost no support!  I will keep it to wear around the house only. Hardly worth it for the money.
3	1381276800	I ordered this bra and another bra from a different brand and I much prefer the other one.  I ordered the size small based on size description and it fits fine, but after a few hours the ribbing of the material starts digging into my ribs and is uncomfortable.  The pads it comes with always get misplaced when you're nursing so I took them out.  However, if you're wearing a thin top, your nips will definitely show through after you nurse.  I wouldn't wear it as an all day every day bra, but for a nursing sports bra it'd work perfectly.
5	1381276800	This is by far my favorite nursing bra.  I have tried many cheap ones and it is 100% worth it to get a good quality nursing bra!! I do occationaly use my cheap ones, but as far as everyday use this is my go to one.  If you are trully into nursing for the long haul a good bra is a serious must!!  It took my second kid to figure this out, and I wish someone would of let me know about this secret.  I have now had this for over 5 months and the wear and tear on it is very minimal for how much I wear.  I measure 34 F and bought the size medium and fits well.  I love the strechyness of the faboric and yet is very supportive.  I wear this at night and during the day.
5	1381276800	This is the best nursing bra I've had! Worth every penny. After having mastitis and clogged ducts, I've learned the importance of a well fitting, good quality nursing bra and this definitely qualifies. It is so soft and comfortable. I typically don't put it in the dryer ( I have on occasion and it was fine) but have found it dries quickly when placed on a drying rack.  Great product.
5	1381276800	I love this bra, can't say enough good things about it. I bought one to try out, and ended up buying two more. It's very comfortable, and I have no issues snapping/unsnapping it with one hand while I'm holding my baby. The design looks like a cami, which is great when your baby is tugging on your shirt and pulling it down in public. I only wish it came in white.
5	1381276800	I struggled to find the right bra that could continue to grow with me as I grow and expand. This bra is absolutely fantastic! It is SO comtortable. I also love that it covers 2 cup sizes - so as I continue to grow, the bra will still fit! The color was bright and absolutely fantastic. I will definitely purchase more!
4	1381190400	Yay! Finally a nursing bra that doesn't make me look lumpy when I put nursing pads in it. The extra padded insert cushions you if you're extra sensitive,  helps guard against leak through and prevents lumpiness. I worried that the padded part would make me look freakishly top heavy but it doesn't add bulk. I tried 2 orher brands of bras. The Motherhood maternity one has molded cups and an underwire and gets very uncomfortable very quickly.  It's not flexible enough to fit when I'm &#34;full up&#34;. And it can still lok a bit lumpy if i don't position the pads just right. The no name one from babies r us doesn't have molded cups and gives that lumpy look with nursing pads. Both were less expensive than this bra but I'd gladly trade those 2 for another of these.
4	1381104000	I love this bra! I love that it comes in S, M, L, so I don't have to guess what size I am, as it changes weekly. I find this bra to be comfortable and supportive, easy to clip/unclip, and I love the removable liners. I am never &#34;showing&#34; with these. The liners also prevent me from leaking through shirts if I forget a nursing pad. I may want another bra with a little more structure to it for going out or dress-up days at work. I feel like I can get a little saggy/unsupported looking with this bra at times. It is very comfortable and functional though. I have several and I wash them daily and they have staid good as new.
5	1381104000	Worth every penny! I never imagined that a non-underwire bra could be so comfortable, yet provide so much support. The silhouette was a little odd for the first few days, but I am extremely happy with the shape now. It just needed a few days to adjust to my body and now fits like a second skin. The silhouette is flattering even while wearing disposable breast pads under thin sweaters, and the material stretches comfortably to accommodate and support the entire range of breast sizes for the nursing mother: from deflated to engorged breasts. Plus, I can unsnap (and resnap) the nursing panel one-handed, keeping the other hand free to wrangle a squirming, hungry baby. Highly recommend to all nursing mothers.
4	1381104000	Fits wonderfully. Love the extra pads to hide the disposable nursing pads. Love the color selections. Did not give a 5 since my size (must be popular) was not in stock for some of the basic colors.
4	1380758400	Very comfortable, the only complaint is the pads in the bra have to be adjusted after you feed. If not they will be scrunched up.
5	1380758400	Comfy and supportive. Bought this bra to transition from last few weeks of pregnancy to nursing. Im at 37 weeks and So far it's great.
5	1380758400	I had purchased one of these nursing bras with my first pregnancy and loved the fit.  It is a very comfortable bra and well constructed.  I love the color options too.  I would definitely recommend these bras.
5	1380672000	Very comfy and fits great. I used the chart to determine my size and it fits great. I like the blue color.
5	1380672000	I waited to get a nursing/pregnancy bra until month 7 of my pregnancy when my other bras were just too small to be comfortable. I wish I hadn't have waited to buy this bra, it is really comfortable.
4	1380672000	I am breastfeeding and needed a bra that would be comfortable, functional and provide support for this new mom.  The Bravdo bra is great for the things I was looking for and well worth the cost. My only con is that even though it's suppose to be great for sleeping in, I think it's a bit to heavy feeling at night.  I would also recommend that moms get fitted for the bra first before ordering online to ensure accurate sizing.
5	1380499200	As a new first time breastfeeding Mom, I had no idea what I would like in a nursing bra/tank before my baby arrived. I also had no idea what size bra I'd need after my milk came in! I had purchased 3 or 4 different bras before I had my baby figuring one would surely fit...ummmmm not at all! I hated them all, I since purchased an addition 3 to 4 bras plus 3 different nursing tanks including many well-known brands....I hated them all! I felt like they either didn't have enough support (I started pre-pregnancy as a very full B cup and am now measuring as an I cup), had really thick straps that would show under my clothes, made my boobs look saggy, I'd leak through, or the cups were too hard and it hurt my nipples.I ordered this bra as a last resort...I felt like I couldn't leave my house because I wasn't able to actually get dressed! It arrived and I'm so totally in love! It fits like a dream, soft enough that it doesn't hurt my nipples but still supportive enough that my boobs look great. It has normal straps so I can wear it under tank tops! And it even has removable thin pads which work great so I don't leak through the bra and my nipples never show either (win-win!!)The one drawback for me is where the clasp is located...it's rather high up on the strap. I find the placement makes it a bit hard to hook one-handed but honestly...I don't care! I'll use 2 hands or deal with the strange placement for the comfort alone! I'm going to purchase a few more because I plan to not wear any other bra ever again while nursing!
5	1380499200	very comfortable, seamless and good strechable. Before pregnant, I was 70b, now I am 7mons pregnant, m size is just fit
5	1380240000	I have been putting up with my normal bras for the last 7 months as they stopped fitting well.  People kept telling me not to buy new bras yet, but I was not comfortable with the way my enlarged breasts were looking with the old bras.  I bought this one based on the reviews and the fact that it has quite the size range.  So happy I did!  Have not gone back to the old bras and will be ordering another Bravado soon.  I will be more comfortable the rest of pregnancy.I would describe the bra as a cross between the comfort and stretch of a sports bra, but with shape and padding of a typical cup bra.  It feels as though there is enough adjustment that the size I purchased will be wearable with the next step of breast feeding.  I think I fall in the middle of the medium size range.I was most worried about the padding being enough to hide the head light effect I constantly have during pregnancy. Most cheap bras I looked at in the stores were not going to cut it.  This bras works great!  And it does not feel overly padded which I am not a fan of either.  Worth the money!
4	1380153600	Great bra!  I got this on the recommendation of a friend, and it is great.  I ordered a second hours within putting it on.  I got a medium and I was a 34 C before pregnancy/nursing.  (I think I'm something like a 36 D now?)  It's soft and wireless and very comfortable, but still gives me a shape under clothes.  My previous underwire, more normal-bra-like nursing bras were both too small when I was full of milk, and too big right after nursing.  This bra accommodates my changing size really well.  It's still new so I can't say how well it holds up after washing.
1	1380153600	Bra did not fit the way it looks on model. Cup pad was too bulky and stuck out instead of lying flat
5	1380067200	The best nursing bra I've found so far. Seamless and soft for a good fit and easy to use straps for nursing
4	1380067200	Very good quality, feels very comfortable on skin, easy open and close, very happy with this product. I ordered one before the baby was born and ordered another one right after. The medium size I ordered fits well (I wore 34C pre-pregnancy).
4	1379808000	Comfy. Fits well. The pads inside the bra are a little awkward. They bunch up on me but are easily fixed.
5	1379721600	The most comfortable nursing bra that I have found. I am very pleased with my purchase. Glad I bought two!
5	1379635200	This bra was a lifesaver as I began nursing.  It fastens in back, so I didn't have to slide anything over my already sore breasts.  It is super comfortable and provides easy access for nursing.  As I have gotten over being incredibly sore and more experienced at breastfeeding, however, I find that I prefer nursing camisoles because they cover my back and stomach when I lift my regular shirt to nurse.
5	1379635200	I Wear it every day and night, very comfortable. I should buy it earlier. I have bought a second one.
5	1379548800	I purchased this early in my pregnancy and used it the most in the first and third trimester and the first month postpartum.  It is so comfortable however doesn't have sexy shape.  In the second trimester I exercised in it.  Now it's mostly for sleeping or when I don't care if I'm sexy.  Still the foam pads and bra have held up wonderfully, looks new.  I lay it flat to dry and wash in a laundry bag.
5	1379548800	I got the cheaper bravada original bra for my first couple of months nursing, but after my coo size settled down, I swapped to this one. It's a great improvement, like it a lot.
5	1379462400	I chose this because it was highly rated on amazon's bestseller list, and I was not disappointed! If you are right on the border between sizes according to the sizing chart, I would go for the bigger size. Before pregnancy I was about a 34 B/C and have been wearing 34D for the past few months. I ordered a medium and it was a perfect fit. It is very comfortable, feels very supportive, and the straps stay where they're supposed to. I also love the pads that it comes with, they're the perfect shape and easily removable. I also got 2 bras from the Elle McPhearson line, but I like this one much better.
5	1379462400	Very comfortable. I'm 8 months pregnant and it was a relief from my normal underwire bras. I like the pads too - I think they'll be nice and concealing for when I'm nursing.  Very pleased - have ordered more.
5	1379116800	This bra is comfortable, as it has no wires, and the dettachable piece makes it convenient for nursing. You just can't wear it with low cut tops. I am 5 ft, 6 in, 140 pounds, and I ordered a medium.
5	1379030400	I've tried several bras from destination maternity bras to target bras. This is the best one by far! It is soft, stretchy, good padding that you can easily put in or out, washes well (I think I've washed it 20 times already and still like new), and very supportive. The bra also exposes your entire chest if you desire so it's also great for skin to skin!
5	1379030400	This bra is fantastic. Super comfortable and well made! Good support for everyday use and washes well. Worth the price.
5	1378944000	I have been looking high and low for a comfortable nursing bra that did not have underwire. This Bravado designs model fit the bill perfectly. I have both the L and XL - both fit as I need them to fit. They are not too small and provide enough support and comfort to be worn multiple times.I went through several bras purchased at target and just could not find anything that worked. So, i went out on a limb and bought this model from Amazon. Worth every penny!
4	1378944000	This bra is reasonably comfortable and plenty supportive for me (I am on the smaller side).  I generally find bras uncomfortable, but this one is decent; the band isn't digging in too much and it's not itchy. The coverage is good, too much for the lowest cut tops, and just enough padding to prevent nipples from protruding.  I like that the padding in the cups is removable, because it makes me feel like I am able to get it all thoroughly clean in the washing machine and that I could hand wash the padding if I wanted to.  The padding does get bunched up sometimes when I fold down the cups for nursing, though,which is annoying.  The clasps that you unhook to open the cups for nursing are easy to open and close once you get the hang of it.  The cups get in the way a bit sometimes because of the padding, but think that's inevitable if you are going to have padded cups.
5	1378771200	I am nursing my third child, and LOVE this nursing bra better than any I had before with my other 2 kids. I wear a 38-40DD and the XL fits perfect.  I prefer to take the cup inserts out since I use nursing pads.  Great comfy fabric.  I actually own 3 of these now, mainly because I know we will have more kiddos some day!
5	1378425600	Product fits comfortably and feels smooth - no uncomfortable elastic bands. Works great during pregnancy and during breastfeeding. So far the best nursing bra I've found.
5	1378339200	I listened to the reviewers and they were right. It is on the pricey side, but face it mamas - you'll be wearing this bra every day for a while and the last thing you want to worry about when nursing is discomfort. I normally wear a 38 B while pregnant and nursing and ordered a medium. It fits perfectly. Can see it would still work as I grow larger or smaller. It's really like a sports bra but not as tight and much more flexible.
4	1378339200	i ordered a large per the guidelines when i was pregnant but that was too small when my milk came in so i got the xl.  the padding is too much for larger busts imo but the bra is super comfortable and i can even sleep in.  worth the money.
4	1378252800	I just received this bra in yesterday and I already love it. I'm currently 34 weeks prego and my breasts have grown a lot since I became pregnant. I would probably wear a 42 DD if I wore a &#34;real&#34; bra but I have been wearing a sort of camisole bra for years so I am very spoiled to a comfortable, wireless bra. I was hesitant to order this bra and pay this much but I'm really glad I did. It's very comfortable and offers good support. I ordered an XL and it fits really well. The clips are relatively easy to unclasp. The only issue I have is that the cups that come with it are easy to see through clothing and fold when folded down but they are easily re-adjustable. All in all, I would recommend this bra, especially to those with a heavier chest.
4	1378252800	I bought this bra for use during pregnancy instead of investing in a bunch of pregnancy bras and nursing bras. It has by far been the most comfortable one I have. It's overall feel is like a sports bra. I thought the sizing was a little large for being on the lower end of the size I ordered, but when I got a size smaller, its almost a little too small. They do, however, stretch out nicely.
5	1378252800	It is really comfortable and offers good support. You can wear it out or to bed and it will not bother you at all. I actually ordered another one after I tried the first bra.
4	1378166400	Im usually a 34D and now that im 7 mos pregnant I decided to go with one of these bras for comfort and so glad I did. I ended up getting the extra large and it fits great, very comfortable and worth the money. I will probably purchase another after baby arrives.
5	1378166400	Nice support, nice style under a shirt (you don't see the outline of breast pads!!) and much less expensive than many other nursing bras.  I have 3 (one black, two butterscotch) and I LOVE them.  I was professionally fitted for my first at a nursing boutique in my hospital... so the size and quality was no surprise when my other two arrived in the mail.  They're holding up well being washed in a lingerie bag and hung to dry.
5	1378166400	I'm not breastfeeding yet, just pregnant, but I LOVE this bra! It really is seamless, it's super soft, and the mechanism works intuitively--it seems like it'll be easy to use.
4	1378080000	Easy to use and very soft. I use these exclusively throughout the time I nurse my babies. I like the straps--they are easy to snap back up after nursing. The design keeps the top hook easily accessible after you're done.  I do not like the pads they come with and just throw all but one set out so I don't have a bunch of bra insets floating around my drawer.
5	1377993600	This is by far my favorite nursing bra that I've tried on. Very comfortable and the drop front snaps aren't too lose where you'll worry they might accidentally come undone like some of the other bras I've tried on.  I also love that it has no under-wire but still holds things firmly in place. Very soft and comfy- highly recommend. The sizing chart is true to size.
4	1377907200	I had gotten the cream colored one of this type before so was surprised to find that the thin foam cup in the black one was different. The cream/butterscotch one had come with a half-sphere foam cup that provided extra support and shape (which I reallyreally liked). It could withstand the washer and keep it's shape and everything--though I didn't allow it to enter the dryer.The black one, however, came with an oddly shaped and flimsy cup. I'm not sure why the foam shapes were different--perhaps I got an old version?---I certainly hope the half-spheres are the new design because the odd shaped ones are annoying. The odd shape makes it difficult to place it in the bra--as you don't know if you have it upside-down or what, and even if you get it right, it's very hard to get both sides to match, so you usually look lopsided/crooked until you manage to shift the foams just right--which can be quite a task. The other thing about them is that they don't hold their shape and fold/crease easily. With the half-sphere ones, you can easily sleep in the bra--a huge comfort, but with the odd ones.... well, you can slip out sometimes if you sleep on your side, even if you keep the straps snug.Anyway, I've given this 4 stars since the overall bra is still very good, and if you get the better cup, it's definitely a 5.The bottom band around the torso is wide but gentle on the skin. The clips are easy to do one handed (at least to me, though it may come with practice). The straps easily adjust and don't slip on their own that much (if at all). And the sizing is right on, even though you can vary a bit while breastfeeding (which is another reason why I prefer the half-sphere).
5	1377907200	During the 3rd trimester of my pregnancy I couldn't fit into my regular bras anymore.  So I got this bra to wear, even though the baby isn't here yet.  It is SUPER comfortable and supportive at the same time.  Obviously I haven't started nursing yet so I can't comment on how it is as an actual nursing bra. All I know is that I love wearing it as a regular bra!10/5/13 update-- Still love this bra now that I'm using it for nursing.  I wear one every day and sometimes sleep in it too.  Very comfortable.  I can unlatch for nursing using one hand! It's supportive too!
4	1377820800	It's my best nursing bra...but it runs a little large.  I should have ordered smaller.  It definitely looks the best under clothes and hides the breast pads better than bras made out of thin stretchy material.
5	1377820800	The perfect nursing bra - after a long, long search! It's comfortable, looks good and is easy to nurse with. Wish I had found it before.
5	1377734400	Very comfortable; fits well and is very supportive. Great to sleep in and wear during day. I purchased in all colors.
5	1377734400	Very comfortable and breathable fabric. Easy to strap and unstrap with one hand. Comfortable to sleep in and provides support. Extra padding hides your nipples so it can be worn without an additional nursing pad. Very practical because it can convert into a regular bra once you Re done with nursing, assuming you stay the same cup size.
5	1377561600	I love this Bra!  I have been searching for a comfortable nursing bra that looks good under clothing for weeks.  I have been to Macy's, destination maternity, target, etc and found nothing that is that comfortable.  I finally decided to look on Amazon and stumbled across this bra.  I have never ordered a bra online, but figured I would try it since I had been to every other store out there and found nothing I was satisfied with.  This Bra fits great.  I ordered a medium and I am a 36D or 36 DD right now depending on the brand.  It fits great and is definitely built to change as you change.  I love this bra and it is so comfortable.
4	1377302400	It is a very comfortable and practical bra, and that's all you're looking for when you're breastfeeding, believe me. The only down side is that since it is not a fashion bra, you can not wear them with tanks or tops that don't have sleeves or have thin sleeves, but other than that, they are great. Also, you can insert the nursing pads for avoiding leeking and they don't show whatsoever, plus they are awesome for sleeping!!! It's an all-day wear bra.
5	1377216000	I am only 12w so it will be a while before I can review this as a nursing bra.  I can say that even now I am very pleased with it--it is soft and very comfortable.  It is also surprisingly supportive for what it is.  I normally wear a 32D or 34C and would have ordered the small, but since my breasts have been getting bigger I ordered a medium.  It is a little bit big but I think this is a good thing--hopefully it will fit when my milk comes in.
5	1377043200	love these bravado bras and am glad i bought it in a fun color other than my usual black/nude bras. the bravado nursing bras are the best that i've tried (also tried pea in the pod) and i wear them comfortably every day.
5	1376956800	This bra rocks! This is my second baby, and I only wish I had found this bra a few years ago! It is super comfy and supportive. With my other bras, as soon as I would get pretty full, I wouldn't be able to stand the feel of the fabric or underwires against my skin. With this bra, I can wear it during the day and night and never feel uncomfortable. The latches are sturdy, and the cup folds down and nicely out of the way for nursing. The inserts are easy to take out and put back in. You don't have to fight to get them to lay flat. I am a 36B - 36C depending on fullness, and the Medium fits perfect.
5	1376956800	This bra is super comfortable, I even wear it to bed.  While breastfeeding I am between a B and C cup and the Medium is a perfect fit.
5	1376784000	The reviews are right. I have tried other brands and I love this bra. It's comfortable, easy to use, the perfect amount of coverage, lightweight, dries fast and is made of a really great quality material. I couldn't be happier with this bra. I have tried other brands and this is the best so far for daytime use for me. I bought 2 underwire ones from the same brand, but haven't tried it yet because I'm still in casual settings mostly and not at work.I bought a small and pre baby I was a true 32C. Post baby, I'm a 32 D/E. Hope this helps!Would recommend and looking to buy more!
5	1376697600	I love this bra, I've probably bought it 4 times, through my 3 kids.  I wear it 24/7 from the first days to the last.  I had the original but didn't want to hassle with changing from a night to day bra.  I just wear this one day and night and once it really gets worn out, I just will buy another.  I'm sure I'll be buying another!- Jane
5	1376611200	Very comfy and thick enough on the sides to where you don't bulge anymore with alleged back fat. Comfy enough to sleep in and wear with nice shirts also.
5	1376611200	It has built-in nursing pad thick enough to wear out and about without worrying leakage and has good support with very comfortable material.
5	1376611200	Very supportive and looks great! Love how it has the removable padding that way I can put a nursing pad and not have to worry about it showing .
5	1376524800	I love that this nursing bra is so comfortable. It was a great fit and worth the price. Totally recommend it!
4	1376524800	I prefer my nursing bras to have a little spandex and not be all cotton which is why I like this bra. It shapes well to your body and the cup inserts shift less than with a cotton bra that can bunch up after nursing. I also really like that there is a thin strap when you detach the front cup. Feels less bulky than other nursing bras that have a larger wedge section of fabric when you unhook.Wish they had a cappuccino color that would work better with my skin tone.
5	1376524800	Fits so comfortably and provides great support. It's easy to unclasp. Highly recommend. Sizing was also very easy since its so adjustable .
5	1376438400	This is the best bra (nursing or not) that I have ever owned.  We are due with our first baby in a couple of weeks and I needed to switch from my underwire maternity bra.  I've always used underwire and was not looking forward to making the switch (for fear of the uniboob), but after wearing this bra I'm never going back.  It is absolutely fabulous.  I'm 5'2" and pre-pregnancy wore a 36C.  I've found with heartburn and increased size, I don't like a constricting bra.  I first ordered the medium and it fit but was very snug on the last hook and I was worried it wouldn't grow with me when I become even larger when the baby's here.So I ordered a large and think it will be perfect.  I have it in buttercup which is great under white shirts.  I have it on the smallest strap and hook settings during the day and even sleep in it at night on a bit looser settings - I've never slept in bras!  It's so comfy!  I like knowing it fits on the smallest settings but I can make it larger and looser if I need to as well.  I also like that the flap comes off to expose the entire breast for feeding - not just a little center part of it.  And the support band at the bottom is quality.  I've tried the cheaper kinds that are basically training bras and just could not see myself wearing those in public or when guests come over.I know I'll be wearing this even after I'm finished breastfeeding - even if I have to order a different size at that time.  It's just that good.
5	1376352000	Great support, comfortable and practical.  Hands down best bra.  It brings a kit to convert it to a regular bra.
5	1376352000	This is the only bra I have worn while breastfeeding my almost one year old son, and I have absolutely no complaints.  I bought several so that I can rotate them out frequently, and I would recommend this product to anyone.
5	1376352000	I bought several different styles of nursing bras, and none of them compare to the Bravado!  It is so much more comfortable and my breasts do not hurt at the end of the day.  I am normally a 38 C (pre pregnancy), and am probably a 40 or 42 C or D while nursing.  The large fits well.  I have ordered the black and may order other colors.  This is worth every penny!
5	1376179200	One of my favorite nursing bras and it looks really nice. I bought a 2nd one because I just really love this bra. Very comfortable. I got X-Large...I'm 5'8&#34; and about 210 with probably around size 40 DD right now from nursing. I'm normally a C cup. This bra is nice and stretchy so it accommodates your breasts changing size.
5	1376179200	I have been through 5 maternity bras with no success as to fit.  Finally when this one arrived, it finally fit.  It is great to have padding in it over the nipple.  Most of the others didn't do well with hiding how pointy they are right now.  It is easy to adjust in the front as to the strap which was nice for me.  I like how soft the feel is and the color was fun too.  It is also very comfortable to wear being a soft cup bra.  One that I've tried before had a wire that would did right into my underarm.It was the most expensive one that I've ordered, but I plan to order some more in different colors because it is so great.Finally! A bra that will work for me!
5	1376006400	It's so soft i love it. It fit just right. Having it is so helpfull for breastfeeding. It just expensive so i just have one wish it cost less.
5	1376006400	Finally a nursing bra I feel comfortable leaving the house in!  I hated the $20 bra I got from Target and the $60 bra from Nordstrom. This one feels and looks good. Totally worth the price.
5	1375920000	I have nursed three children and been through several bras but this is by far my favorite. So comfortable all day. Easy one hand snap on and off. I'm big chested and its plenty supportive. I took out the pads. I did not care for them. You won't be disappointed.
2	1375833600	Ok smaller band larger cup women this Bravado sizing chart is a joke.  I followed their sizing and I can barely breath with this thing on.  Large does not fit 36F.  Give it up.  I am currently trying to stretch this thing out by putting it on my mannequin and stuffing all types of things into the cups - hehehee.  Anyway I just bought a Elomi and I love it!!
5	1375747200	I would recommend this product to all preggo moms and nursing moms! It is so comfortable, has nice coverage and also has padding so nothing 'shows'.
5	1375747200	Was kind of worried to buy online a bra. But it is a very good quality product, I recommend it. Very practical, will probably use it even after I wean the baby.
4	1375574400	I bought this bra because I had a mastectomy and a friend let me borrow a Bravado bra of hers and it worked great. I cannot wear underwire bras anymore and this bra gives good support and is very comfortable.  I decided to buy my own so I could return my friends bras.  They have changed the bra a little bit and I preferred the old version, but this bra still works much better for me than any other bra I've tried on.  It is very comfortable and I would highly recommend it.
5	1375488000	I am in love with this nursing bra. Not only is it supportive and comfortable but it also gives you a really nice shape.
5	1375401600	Have tried many, many others, this one wins hands down for both day and night. Would absolutely buy ten more. It's full coverage so it may show if you wear low-cut tops but when it's mainly the newborn seeing you all day long, comfort wins.
5	1375401600	Totally love this bra!! Fits perfectly and it holds my breasts up. I'm very happy with my purchase! I highly recommend it!
5	1375142400	I love this nursing bra. Perfect for me as a working and nursing mom who needs comfort and good support :)
1	1375142400	I purchased three of these after reading reviews on Amazon, but am very dissapointed in the quality of the bra!  I only wore them a few weeks before one of the hooks broke off.  At this point, one of the three bras I purchased have ALL THREE HOOKS broken off, one of them has one hook left, and one is still working normally (but it's only a matter of time before it's worthless too!).  They have all completely lost their springy/stretchy shape and create one saggy uni-boob.Dissappointed.
5	1375056000	Most comfortable nursing bra I own! Very easy to use for first time moms. Would recommend this to a friend.
4	1375056000	Built with room to grow but doesn't look baggy. Love it's ability to convert to a regular bra after nursing!
5	1375056000	This has made breastfeeding so much easier. It fits and supports very well. This is my second kid and I swore I would not breastfeed if I could not be more comfortable and this has made all difference
5	1374796800	This bra is a necessity for those moms who are breastfeeding and want a comfy bra in home, while traveling, visiting family, etc; it is quite versatile and easy to use. The material is soft and breathable with just enough support that doesn't feel like a tighter sports bra. I bought the brighter melon color and am very pleased with it so far. It has the built in breast pads and if you needed to add another layer to your already leaking breasts while breastfeeding, you can without feeling bulky or bulging. Definitely recommend this.
5	1374796800	As a mother of a 16 month old who is still nursing, I have been through my share of good and bad nursing bras.  This is probably the best one I've found.  It's probably the most money I've spent on a nursing bra, but totally worth it.  No underwire yet it's very supportive, and is so soft!  It has removable bra pads which allow a smooth look without having a molded cup.  Fits well all over, I love it.  I'm slightly asymmetrical and wear a larger size (usually a 38DD or large size) and this fit comfortably all around.  I bought a similar one from JCPenney in the past, but this definitely tops my list- will be buying another in the future as baby #2 is on the way!
5	1374796800	I am between sizes and was not sure what to get - so I tried this one. It fits sooooo comfortably and does not show any lactation &#34;leaks: since it has nice padding. Highly recommended!
5	1374710400	This is a great product for everyday wear - very comfortable, fits well, and is supportive.  I've already bought another one.
4	1374710400	Second nurse bra i tried. Pretty comfortable even for someone with sore nipples and engorgement. I figured it hurts less nursing pad in it. Size wise - i used to wear 32a or b. small fits just fine.
5	1374710400	great nursing bra, I recommend it! I have bought several of these and I can't live without them. Try it.
5	1374624000	This is my most comfortable bram. I am a 36E and the large size fits great! I bought some bras before that had underwire which hurts. This bra was a nice change!
2	1374624000	I am normally a 34 B. While breast feeding I am a 36 C, so based on the sizing I should be a medium. The cups in the medium were too big and I should have gone with the small. Especially after wear, it would had stretched out way too much. I decided to return the item because I can get my pea in the pod nursing bras which are almost identical) for the same price and I prefer them over this one. It is a nice, smooth, soft, stretchy material though.
5	1374364800	I was looking for a bra to wear at home that was comfortable. I needed a bra that I could sleep in and didn't make me feel self conscious when I had to go out to walk the dog or when guest came over the house. This is the perfect bra. I ended up buying another one so I could interchange them. The removable padding is perfect to cover the headlights. Pre-pregnancy I was a 32B, the small fits perfectly. I will definitely be using this post-pregnancy for nursing.

I will definitely be using this post-pregnancy for nursing.
5	1374278400	The first time I purchased this bra, the sizing chart indicated that I was on the borderline of size S and size M. When I got both, size S was obviously too small, and size M fit perfectly. This bra is very comfortable and provides adequate support. I wear it all day and when I sleep. I even wear it when I'm working out (with a shelf-bra top over it for added support). I like that it's machine-washable, and it dries quickly when I hang it to dry. Highly recommended.
4	1374278400	I like this bra. Fits well. Clips seem pretty durable so far. My only complaint is that I have to unfold and re-adjust the pads every time I nurse. I'm sure once my son eats less, it won't be a big deal.
4	1374192000	I followed the sizing chart from the company and the bra fit perfectly. I am about a 36D right now and I wear a medium. I would definitely recommend waiting until the very end of your pregnancy or just after delivery before deciding on the size. I like that there is a pad insert that hides breast pads well. The material keeps my skin well ventilated during the hot summer. The downside to this bra being seamless and without underwire is that it doesn't lift my breasts very well and makes everything look a little saggy. Overall I would recommend this bra. I have now bought 2 of them to alternate.
5	1374105600	This is hands down one of the most comfortable nursing bras out there.  I bought the large since I am currently at a 38DD and it fits perfect.  It's not scratchy and there is nothing that digs into my skin.  I like that it includes removable padding so it hides nursing pads or your nips!  The product includes instructions on how to convert this into a &#34;regular&#34; bra once you're done using it as a nursing bra so that's a bonus and totally worth the price!
5	1374019200	I was worried about paying this much for a nursing bra. I've tried several brands and styles.  This bra is soft, comfortable, supportive and easy to nurse baby in.  I am very pleased with this purchase. Glad I spent the money.  On a side note, I purchased the Bravado brand &#34;Basics&#34;  nursing bra in a similar style from Target.  While it is also comfy, soft and easy to use, it is not as supportive.
5	1374019200	I'm pretty busty (36F) so I have been very hesitant about buying a wireless nursing bra. Underwires are usually a necessity for me because I need all the support I can get. When I received this bra I was so pleased with the overall fit. I bought I large and it fits pretty well. Definitely a different shape than a typical underwire bra, but as a nursing bra, i think it serves it's purpose with a surprising amount of support. It is VERY comfortable- I'm 8 months pregnant and I've been wearing it to bed. I am planning on buying another one once I have the baby. I have a feeling I'll need to get an XL once my milk comes in, but I'm worried the band will be too big.
5	1373932800	I've had a few different (and high end) nursing bras, and I love this one.  It grows with you and is so comfortable.  Also, there is no under wire, which can be bad for breastfeeding.
5	1373846400	Has good reviews for a reason! This is my first nursing bra, and I am definitely pleased. Looks great underneath clothes. Really feels like I'm not even wearing a bra which I honestly love. I wear a 38 D and ordered a medium. Fits perfect!
5	1373846400	I live in this! Now it's not 100% perfect, but I think it's the best one on the market. It's VERY comfortable, and works great -- very handy for a nursing mother. The only downside(s) are the straps. When nursing, the strap becomes looser, and may slide off of your shoulder. Also, if you're holding your baby up on your shoulder, watch to make sure the plastic snaps are not right in their face (especially unsnapped).
5	1373846400	I am 8 1/2  months pregnant and went from Barely a 34B cup to a 34D cup! I needed to start looking for nursing bras, so I found this one and I have to say it is soooo comfortable! I love that it doesn't have under wire and it provides the support I need. I bought a size M and it's perfect.  It has a V so you can wear V-neck shirts. There are removable pads if you want to take them out, I like them, they are thin enough to be comfortable and they help with the RT. I ended up buying another one in butterscotch. I plan on living in these bras for the next few months, so I'm glad I spent the extra $$ on a bra that's worth it, instead of buying a bunch of crappy inexpensive bras that would end up costing me more in the long run.I also really like the back enclosure on this bra - and it comes with a conversion kit.
2	1373846400	I wanted to like it. I got same brand from target but cheaper and it was a different model. I just wanted one in black. Well target doesn't carry the black one so I tried this. The cup gives an awful shape. I removed and it still not good. I just want to find a decent black one that is also good for sleeping in and nice and light. The search continues...of course amazon was excellent and fast about my return. 5 stars for customer service!
2	1373760000	I can't speak for everyone, of course, but this bra absolutely did not work for me.  I really expected more given all the positive reviews, but it was ill-fitting and looked terrible.I did measure myself--more than once--based on the charts from Bravado's website.  I fell right in the middle of the size I ordered, but when I tried it on, it was saggy and too small, leaving me with that double-bubble look.  It wasn't supportive at all and much worse than the (way cheaper!) bras I already had from Motherhood, and I immediately returned the product to Amazon.  The Anita Women's Summer T-Shirt Nursing Bra I purchased in the same order, however, fit great and I plan to order another.I am small (4'11&#34;) and very large-chested, so I'm not sure whether this would be a problem for everyone, but for me at least, this wouldn't work even as a sleep bra.
5	1373760000	Love this bra! I started off in a Large when I was 8 months pregnant. I am now 5 months post partum and transitioning to Mediums! I wish I would have found these earlier in my pregnancy.
5	1373673600	I had one when I was nursing my second child and can't wait to use it with my next baby due next month!
5	1373587200	I have spent quite a bit of time (and money) looking for a good bra since having my daughter. I have finally found it in this bra! I have only had it a month, but have worn it every day! With breastfeeding, my breasts are changing size all of the time, but no matter what size they happen to be, this bra fits them perfectly! I didn't care for the inserts that were supposed to hide the nursing pads, they are really obvious, but after a few months of nursing and you generally don't need the pads anyway. All in all, I love this bra and will definitely be getting a few more!
5	1373328000	I normally only wear under wire bras, but don't like them when nursing. This bra still offers good support and is very comfortable.It also has enough padding to hide nursing pads. I like that it is stretchy and worked really when during the first week or two while my body was adjusting sizes due to engorgement.
1	1373328000	I am surprised by all the reviews saying how comfortable these bras were. When I received the Bravado bra and touched the material with my hands, I could tell it wasn't going to be comfortable. The material is somewhat rough and when I put it on, I was immediately itching to get out of it and I decided it had to go back. I purchased instead the Emma Jane bra, which is similar in design but the material so much more comfortable.
4	1373241600	Very comfortable, nice fit with or without removable pads. I bought 2 and only wear my other nursing bras if these both happen to be in the laundry at the same time ! My favourite nursing bra.
4	1373241600	Worth every penny, comfy and great support without being too tight. Easy access. I'll be buying a second. Great bra!
5	1373241600	i started pre-pregnancy as large A/small B cup and then had to buy new bras as my entire body expanded during pregnancy.  A size small was perfect during the pregnancy to support the bigger boobies (grew to a size C) and when I became engorged and my milk came in.  I'm now 6 weeks postpartum, breastfeeding and the size small is still a good fit.  i think i read somewhere that this bra can accommodate for up to 2 bra sizes.  i have 2 in different colors.  i like how it's soft without underwire but supportive.  good exposure of the breast when nursing (some tank tops/shirts only allow for a small hole which isn't big enough).  definitely give this a go.
4	1373068800	After trying out several different nursing bras, I have finally found one that works! I am a size 38d and I ordered a large.  I bought this bra after buying the same one a few weeks ago in a different color. This bra fits well, is supportive, durable, and very comfortable. It can also be washed in the washing machine and dried in the dryer which is very convenient!  It also comes with a conversion kit so when I am done nursing, it will turn into a regular bra. I will probably buy one or two more of this bra to complete my nursing bra stash. I'm so glad I gave this nursing bra a chance!
4	1372982400	loved getting this product.  Color was really pretty and fit felt great.  Expecting twins in 4 wks so i'm looking forward to trying it out for nursing,  but fits great now as a daily comfy bra.
5	1372809600	I bought this in XL because I wanted it to still fit in 3 months as I am not yet due.  It is a bit large now, but should be perfect in three months.  It is very comfortable and I love the color.  It seems easy to use, but as I have not yet had the baby I don't know exactly.  I will try to update.  This appears to be a well made product and good buy for the money.
5	1372809600	This is a great nursing bra. Very comfortable and easy to hide the pads. I even started wearing it before I had the baby because it was so easy to get on
4	1372723200	I bought this bra and the Bella materna bra. Nothing compares to the Bella but its also double the price. This bra is good however my boobs didn't always feel supported and sometimes felt a bit saggy. I still wear it and when it comes out of the wash its a great fit.
4	1372723200	I love wearing this nursing bra.  I wash it whenever possible because I always want it clean.  It is soft and it fits very well.  This bra is definitely full-coverage so I never have to worry about my cups "spilling over".  It feels good on my body, it sits comfortably around my rib cage, & it unsnaps easily for nursing.I am surprised, however, to see how many reviewers comment that this bra is supportive.  This is a very soft, flexible fabric with no under-wire.  Therefore, it is not overly supportive.  I have found that this bra cannot hold my chest from bouncing dramatically when I am walking quickly, bending over, or (god forbid) running.  I wear this bra when I am having a quiet day doing no more than grocery shopping or playing around the house with my daughters.I love this nursing bra though & it is a perfect option for those whose cup size fluctuates greatly due to nursing.  I wear this bra often & will continue to do so.
4	1372377600	Best nursing bra. They offer different colors I was sick of black, white, and nude. Great comfort and good support. I am about a DDD and I feel comfortable and supported in this bra which is hard to do.
5	1372204800	Good bra for nursing! I'm considering buying a couple more.The only con:  too pricey.Other than the price, I recommend.
5	1372204800	Good support. Fit needs just great. I mean, you could tell I wasn't wearing a push up bra :) But it was great in those beginning months and for in the home.
5	1372118400	I feel compelled to write a review since I am so pleased with this product. I am on my fifth month of nursing and wish I had found this bra sooner. It is so comfortable!! Perfect amount of support. I was hesitant, but the number of rave reviews convinced me to try it out and I'm so glad I did. I typically have a very difficult time finding bras that fit properly because I am 6'. This bra has none of the usual issues and fits like a dream. As far as sizing, I found myself wondering if I should go with a M or L, because I'm the largest size that falls under M but have always fit better in L items in general. I went with L because I didn't want to be disappointed with a too-small product. If I were pickier, I'd probably end up exchanging for the M, but I'm OK with the L and don't want to go through the exchange process. I do have to fasten the hooks on the next to tightest setting on the band, but I don't foresee it stretching out enough to make this a problem in the future. I'd recommend others follow the size chart exactly, as a M would likely have fit me the way its intended to fit. All in all, an excellent product and well worth the price. If I have more kids, I will likely only use this nursing bra in the future. It's that awesome.
4	1371859200	After all the positive reviews, I was expecting this bra to blow my mind.  I am giving it 4 stars because it is definitely more comfortable than the bra I was wearing, though it still does give me a bit of the uni-boob. I ordered a large according to the sizing guidelines, and while the strap is the right size around, the cup area is a little small for me (I'm normally a 36 DDD). I'm already busting out a little bit and I haven't even delivered yet.
5	1371859200	I was surprised when on the Bravada website, it said I'd need a medium.  I would've picked a bigger size on my own and it would've been a mistake.  It fits great and is even comfortable to sleep in.  The molded cups that can easily be repositioned or removed if you don't like them will hide nursing pads even on thin shirts.  I bought a couple Motherhood bras (sports bra style) and they don't fit nearly as well.  With those, the nursing pads don't stay in place when I sleep or even as I move throughout the day.  Due to price, I held off on the Bravada but now wish I never bothered with the Motherhood bras.  Yes, they cost a lot but they are worth every penny.
5	1371859200	My wife has really enjoyed using this bra during her nursing of our second child.  For our first, she tried quite a few different bras, all of which were not very useful to her.  Her comments to me about this one are that she really likes the wireless support on the underside of the bra, and the 3 hook clasp in the back provides great support.  She has not had any problems unhooking the clasp to feed the baby either.  It's a win for everyone!
5	1371772800	This is an absolute &#34;MUST HAVE&#34; or any nursing mother.  It is very comfortable, feels more supportive than other nursing bras.  It has easy snaps on the sides for easy nursing.  Fits perfectly.
5	1371772800	This is an excellent nursing bra that is top quality. Bravada had done an excellent job making a super comfortable bra for nursing moms!At 12 weeks post birth I have been wearing it 24/7. A few points:1.When it unclips to open your breast is fully exposed. There isn't another layer with a large hole and there are also no supportive side panels. There is a thin comfortable band with the function of keeping the shoulder strap on. When it is open and baby nurses your other breast is still fully covered and where the open side is folded down has never bunched up. It is very comfortable!!2. This is a functional more than fashionable bra but I am very happy with the pink ice color to make me feel more feminine. I am 5'4", 145 currently with a 36C post baby chest. I first bought a medium in the nude color. After 10 weeks supply leveled out and I wanted another one because it was my favorite. I chose the pink ice and waffled between another M or trying a S. I am normally a small 34A or 32B. And because the hooks have 4 options and the fabrics is so comfortable I decided to get a S. I am happy I did. It fits great and will until I am done nursing while I continue to lose weight and solids are eventually introduced. I'm wearing my M right now and it also fits fine for now and if/when the cup starts to feel too big I can always put in the removable inserts to smooth it out.3. Extras!! I took the cup inserts out but they are terrific to have. I will use them in a dress/top that is not forgiving enough to hide breast pad wrinkles. They will also come in handy when my M cups get a little too big at the end of nursing and I want to smooth the cup out. You ALSO get clips to turn the bra into a regular bra when you are done nursing. What a wonderful extra!
5	1371772800	Soft, comfy. After I deliver the baby it will fit even better as now it tends to sit a bit higher because of the belly.
5	1371686400	This bra saved me. Just when pregnancy had me growing out of every bra I own and I had given up ever finding one that could be supportive and comfortable for the next 5 months I found Bravado! I can't wait to buy one in every color and I'm happy that I will be able to wear this beyond my pregnancy.
5	1371600000	Wow--never felt a bra that was as comfortable as this one.  I highly recommend this for those who are nursing.  It's versatile as well and can be used even after nursing.  Absolutely love it!
5	1371513600	I bought this bra to accommodate my growing breasts through pregnancy (not even nursing yet!) since I was outgrowing my normal bras like crazy. It is very comfortable to wear and is very adjustable in terms of size. Plus the material is stretchy so the cup size has some give and take for changing cup size. Definitely a good buy!!
5	1371427200	I was a 36DD before pregnancy and this bra felt wonderful during the last months of pregnancy. The soft elastic band is exactly what I wanted for a belly that expanded into my bust line! The shoulder straps are adjustable, the clips are easy to handle for nursing, and it is incredibly soft! It doesn't offer support for my bra size but fits great and is perfect for life with baby.
5	1371427200	I ordered several styles of nursing bras because I know I'll be needing them for the next year.  This is the best one by far and I would wear it even if I weren't nursing.  Good support, thin straps are more attractive and allow for greater flexibility with various clothing.  Cups are well padded.  First day I wore it for 20 hours and had no soreness.  Highly recommended.
5	1371427200	Definitely the best nursing bra I have bought.  Very comfortable for use before you begin nursing and after. seamless bra so looks good under shirts too. Highly recommend.
5	1371340800	I LOVE it!  We'll see how times goes, but this bra is extremely comfortable.  I was unsure about the padding inside, and took it out immediately.  I soon realized that the padding helps to keep the nursing pad lines from being visible.I love the color, the fit, it's easy to nurse in, and I even slept in it once or twice.  If it continues to do well over the next few weeks, I will be purchasing a few others!I'd recommend it to busty nursing mothers.  I'm a 34 DDD, and the large is a great fit for me.
5	1371340800	I bought one of these bras based on recommendations from others and the amazon reviews. This bra did not disappoint!  It is incredibly comfortable and looks great under clothes. I am usually an A cup, so i was worried about the fit, but it fits beautifully. This bra is definitely worth every penny.
4	1371254400	I'd purchased the Bravado Basics bra last time I was nursing, and loved it. I couldn't find that one so I got this instead. It's a very comfy bra, but I hate the three clasps in back. I don't need that much support, so it sort of seems like overkill. And when you're trying to dress yourself as quickly as possible after a much needed shower (because you've got a crying newborn) that extra clasp is nothing but annoying! Otherwise, the bra is exactly what I needed.
5	1371254400	This is the best nursing bra I have tried & I have tried many! It keeps the girls in place well even though it's not underwire. It's very comfy & supportive. Worth every penny!!
4	1371168000	I bought two of these to wear when I sleep. Since then I have switched to nursing tank tops from Target at night. These have become my main staple bras for day-time wear. They are very comfortable. The pads inside the bra can get folded and mangled when pulling down the sides but I have gotten used to re-adjusting them. If you don't take them out prior to washing, they will fall out in the laundry as well. But over all this is a great product.
5	1371081600	I Love it! It's very comfortable and provided great support. This has to be the best maternity I've found. Thank you Amazon!
4	1371081600	Very soft and you forget it's there. I'm a 34B (before pregnancy) and I grew a cup and size small was still great for me.
5	1370908800	I am a new FTM and these bras are the most comfortable nursing bras I've found, totally worth the price.  They were incredibly supportive without being constricting during the engorgement phase and are now comfortable and convenient.  I was on the borderline in terms of sizing and went with a M (vs. S).  The cups fit great, but I am concerned the band will be too big very soon- the weight/bloat is coming off a little quicker than I expected.  If they do end up too big I will totally spend the money and get a couple in the smaller size, they are that comfortable.
5	1370822400	This is my fourth pregnancy, and by far the most comfortable nursing bra I have ever owned.  It is nothing special as far as looks go, but that is not my concern. I wanted a supportive, comfortable bra for my pregnancy and nursing.  I love the sizing chart. It made it very easy to pick out a bra online. I found the sizing chart true to size. The material is very comfortable.  I love the removable pads.  The pads give my shirts a smooth nice finish.  Bra has washed well, and air drys overnight.  I have worn it for four months so far, and it has held up great!  This bra is well worth the price.  I normally would never pay $40 for a bra, but this is an exception! I would recommend to any soon to be or nursing mom!
5	1370822400	Absolutely love this nursing bra! It is comfortable to wear all day and night yet provides me with the support I need. It even has removable lining/pads to prevent nipple show-through. Well worth the $!
5	1370822400	I feel comfortable in it,just the right size.I regret not to buy it earlier.I think I will buy again.It's really wanderful.
5	1370822400	Amazingly comfortable, and I had to hunt high and low to find a nursing bra whose straps could be let down all the way. As a woman who is 5' 11&#34;, I have had to scratch my head since having my first baby 8 months ago, wondering where the heck do other tall women find nursing bras?!? I have a very long torso, and have tried on countless other nursing bras and camis - none of which are long enough for me. I'm not super well-endowed, maybe a C cup now that I am nursing, but I had a lot of trouble (and unnecessary stress) over finding a nursing bra. I love this bra, have three now and might even buy more. Don't hesitate to buy this one - it's wonderful! So many others out there have stitching or fabric that are downright painful (Hello? Our girls are extremely sensitive now, so use soft fabrics, elastic and thread! It should be a no-brainer.)Bottom line: If you're tall like me and want the elastic band to go where it belongs (under the girls), get this one!
5	1370649600	... After ordered and returning no less than 8 nursing bras, I am so happy to have found this one. It fits perfectly (I am a now 6 mo along and am wearing a 36-DD or 38 D). The fabric is soft, the color is pretty, and I've even slept it in. While it certainly doesn't provide the lift of an underwire or shape of my &#34;regular&#34; bras, it is supportive enough to be out and about, it looks good under clothes, and I anticipate living in this bra through the rest of my pregnancy and nursing... I highly recommend! I've already ordered it in another color.
5	1370563200	I ordered 2 of these bras and they are awesome! They fit great and are so comfy and have great support. I will most likely order more. Great product!
5	1370390400	I got this bra following the birth of my first child two and a half years ago. She nursed for 15 months, but the bra is so comfortable that I've used it even after she was weaned!
4	1370390400	I was greatful someone took the time to post sizes but I disagree slightly with the fitting,I have another Bravado Nursing Bra exactly like this that is an actual 32D so I ordered the small BUT this slides up my back and I&#34;m going to have to stitch the sides so that its small enough for my ribcage. I like the padding coverage but I dont like the fact that its SMALL MEDIUM LARGE fitting I really wish it was sized like a normal bra, not a sports bra. otherwise I love these bras
1	1370217600	This is ok. It is a sports bra-like nursing bra, with more support than I've seen from these types of bras. However, no better support (I would argue less) than my other favorite nursing bra (loving moments nursing bra sports bra) from walmart, which is more like a bra than a sports bra. It has more support, and doesn't expose your whole breast while nursing. This bra leaves you totally exposed. Also, the material under the breast and in the back folds under. The straps aren't very comfortable. There is also no material between your breasts, so they are squished together, which I fear will lead to a rash on the hot days. That being said, it is relatively comfortable so that I can picture wearing it around the house, and I don't feel like returning it. I was on the fence and decided to give it a good day of wear, and therefore had to take off the tags. My other favorite bra that I mentioned above, is literally 1/5 the cost of this one. I have about 10 of them, and they've held up through 4 years of nursing. I only branched out because I was looking for something different with a little more support. I am a 42DD, and there is absolutely no way this would fit any larger cup size, I am completely spilling out of it if I don't adjust it constantly. I wouldn't mind it for less money, but for $50, this is a disappointment. Going back to my more supportive, more comfortable, cheaper option.
5	1370217600	I bought a few nursing bras from macys as well as this one. I really like this one the best. It has no underwire which is really comfortable and it still supports your breasts without making them look saggy.
5	1370044800	I love these bras and have lived in them ever since my first child was born in 2010.  They're remarkably comfortable and stretch/contract along with the constantly changing breast size of a nursing mama.  The pad pockets are great for extra coverage and structure and the clasps are easy to work one-handed after a couple of tries.  I think I have four of these at the moment, two that are still in great condition after three years of use and two new ones bought just recently.  A great bra for making nursing and pumping a little easier and more comfortable.
5	1369958400	I had multiple sets of Motherhood bras for my first 4 kids, and after my last set wore out, I needed some new bras. After searching and searching, trying on every kind of bra, my sister recommended the Bravado bra.  I was hesitant to buy these bras because they were expensive. I have been wearing them for 3 months, and they are SO WORTH IT!!! These are so much more comfortable than the Motherhood bras!! I wish I would have found theseyears ago!!! They are the most comfortable bras I have worn, nursing or not. They also convert to a regular bra, and come with the hardware to do so. I will be wearing these from now on!
5	1369958400	This is the only nursing bra I wear.  I have three and thinking about getting a fourth one.  I have the black, nude and pink.  Love the pink color.  The removable padding in the pink bra is different than the padding on the other 2 bras.  It's cut in a circle and the shape doesn't look as natural.  The padding on the other two is triangular in shape like in a bikini and looks more natural.
5	1369872000	I LOVE this bra.  Seriously it's so comfortable.  I hate bras normally.  This bra is really supportive even of size D-DD breasts.  I love that I'm still in the same size as I was postpartum to 2 years in to nursing (my breasts did change over the time) and now I'm wearing it as a maternity bra.  I'm really tempted to stick with this bra for forever because it's so comfortable.  The clips come undone easy enough to nurse discreetly in public and the flaps fold really nicely.  The light padding helps hide any nursing pads or flaws.  The only downside is every time I wash it I have to mess around with the padding for a while to get it in the just right position again.
5	1369785600	I bought this as a gift and have just recently heard that the mom who received it is pleased.She was using it while she nursed her baby.
5	1369699200	Being a new mom and looking for the right fit has been challenging but I was able to find jist the right bra. This bra is so comfortable that it doesn't feel like I wearing one. he fabric is very soft and flexible.I was hesitant on the size but I chose correctly. During my pregnancy I wore a 38D so I bought a large and it fits great. According to the size chart I am a medium, but I don't like my back skin to be overflowing through my clothes.Love this bra!!!!
5	1369699200	This bra is a mix between a sports and an under wire bra.  It is incredibly comfortable.  Haven't started breast feeding yet, but so far, it is working to support my added growth.  I may have to make the switch permanent - throughout the day, it's entirely unnoticeable compared to my usual discomfort with under wire.  Yeah!
5	1369612800	I almost didn't buy this bra because of the price but finally caved after trying unsuccessfully to find a good, cheap bra at Target or Motherhood Maternity. This bra was more amazing than I could have hoped - EXTREMELY comfortable, great fit, easy to use, and very durable. I used a bra for a year and a half (wore it every day!) with my first son, the while I was pregnant with my second before I somehow broke one of the clasps in the back. I'm now on my second bra and have had it almost a year with the same great experience. Order this bra! You won't be disappointed!
5	1369612800	I bought three different nursing bras for my first child (after going to a nursing specialist and being fitted for bras). This one is the only one I felt completely comfortable in. There are four sets of clasps in the back that allowed me to wear the bra for the year I nursed as I lost weight. It also has a great profile from the side and back while still retaining support. I bought two more of the same bra for baby number two and they are all I plan to wear.
4	1369526400	This bra is comfortable & easy to use.  I haven't had the baby yet, so we'll see how it functions for actual breastfeeding...
5	1369526400	yes it seems a bit pricey but compared to other maternity/nursing bras ive tried these are awesome. So soft lightweight you forget your wearing them at all. Great for all day use and in bed to sleep
5	1369440000	One of the most challenging things about being a nursing mom was finding nursing bras that fit well.  In my first pregnancy I went to a bra shop with experienced fitters, but it's an hourlong drive each way and they do not carry Bravado brand bras.  I liked the easy sizing of the Body Silk bra and currently own two - one purchased late in both pregnancies.During pregnancy I'm around a 38-40D, expanding to a DD in the early days of nursing.  With our first baby I bought an XL Body Silk bra and found that it fit perfectly when I was a DD but didn't give enough support in late pregnancy or after a few months when I dropped back down to a C/D cup.  This time I bought the L Body Silk and am very happy with the fit in late pregnancy and anticipate it will be a better fit once my milk supply is established and my cup size decreases to normal.  I would say that if you're borderline between sizes, choose the smaller size.Body Silk bras are comfortable and easy to use.  Of note is that the clips are great compared to other nursing bra/tank brands - there is no awkward fiddling under your shirt, just simple one-handed clipping and unclipping.The look of the bra under clothing is comparable (IMO) to a tee shirt bra or other non-underwire bras.  I do remove the soft cups because they give kind of a funny look if I leave them in the bra.  I use nursing pads anyways, but if you don't and choose to remove the cups, be advised that the stretchy material of the Body Silk bra may show more nipple than you'd like to.I still believe that if a nursing mom wants an underwire nursing bra, a professional fitting is essential due to the risk of milk duct compression and mastitis with an ill-fitting underwire.  Before returning to work I'll be going to a Bravado certified fitter to make sure that I have the correct underwire fit.  However, for a comfortable/casual non-underwire nursing bra I recommend the Body Silk to all of my friends who have new babies and are nursing!
5	1369353600	I bought 3 different styles of nursing bras. I hesitated on this one because of the high price, but it looked comfortable and had great reviews. I returned one of the other bras and this one is by far my favorite. Sizing should be determined by your band width and I recommend XL for 40+, even if the chart says different.Comfort is of top importance to me now, as I am 8 months pregnant. The reviews were right and this is an extremely comfortable bra and I came back to buy a second one. I haven't been using the clips, as baby is not here yet, so I can't attest to how well those work. This bra is not going to give you an especially lifted perky shape, but it does it's job. So if you value comfort over perkiness (as I don't think you can really get both) then invest in this bra!
4	1369267200	I love the convenience of this bra & no seams.  It's very comfortable & the plastic snaps are very sturdy.  I never have an issue with them.  I'm a 34C/D & the medium fits perfectly.  I do leave the pads in the bra because I like more coverage.  Most of the time I do wear reusable nursing pads & sometimes it can look lumpy if I don't get them in there exactly right.  Overall I would tell anyone to buy this bra!!
2	1369094400	I have had this bra for 4 months and a clasp has already come loose on it. I expected a bit more from a $50 bra. I wrote to Bravado and despite receiving an automated reply saying they would get back to me, I haven't heard from them. It has been over a week now. Perhaps I got the lemon of the batch, but just wanted to let others be aware that if you order and something happens, you may not get any help or refund.
4	1369094400	I am a 36 DD and it said I wore a Large, My breast fell out at the top a little, so I am exchanging it for an XLG.  But I like the supportive band at the bottom, the clips are a little hard to use one-handed.
1	1369094400	I keep struggling to find any nursing bra that does not have underwire but will fit a large breasted but narrow chested woman.  This was not it.  I'm a 32H and all the nursing books recommend no underwire, but I just cannot find anything that fits.
5	1369008000	This bra provided the support I need along with comfort.  If you are nursing this is the bra for you!
5	1369008000	I was looking for a bra that was comfortable like a sleep bra but still gave me support - this one is great! It's not the best support (doesn't lift them up enough) but is the best one that I have been able to find being high on the comfort scale.
4	1369008000	I love the fit of this bra. It's high enough under the arms and low enough on my torso that it doesn't squish any &#34;chub&#34;. The material is a little firm at first, but once you wear it for a few minutes, it loosens up and conforms to your body. The straps connect and disconnect easily (one handed once you get the hang of it). My only complaint is that the elastic band that you connect the flap to stretches out. After a little while using it, you have to tuck in the excess strap or it sticks out the side. I bought in black and light pink. Sizing is true to size chart. I purchased a Medium as a 38C and it fits me perfectly.
5	1369008000	I am six months pregnant with my second. I went cheap on nursing bras with my first and decided to spring for something a little more spendy this time around.First off, I was nervous about the sizing as I do have a large chest and was unsure if the size chart would be accurate, and it was right on. This bra seems very flexible and I can imagine it still fitting when my milk comes in and the fluctuations that happen between being pregnant and nursing.Next, I have to rave about the comfort. You really do get what you pay for! It is very soft to the touch, supportive and sometimes I forget I am wearing! I have always been one of those girls who rips her bra off and throws on sweats when I walk into my house, but lately I have been leaving my bra on without even thinking about it.Finally, the pad inserts are way better than expected. I have also tried the genie bra pre-pregnancy and the pads that are supposed to hide the nipples would slide all around and get lumpy. With this bra, they stay in place and don't get lumpy.I have yet to use this bra while nursing, but I have played around with the snaps and think that it will work out well. I plan on buying another one for back up!
5	1368921600	I used this Bra for during my 1st pregnancy and am now using for my 2nd. This time around, I have pain in my armpits apparently due to growing breast tissue that extends into your armpits. This bra helps provide the support I need and help minimize that pain for me.
4	1368921600	This is definitely the best for the price that I found. It could be a bit mor supportive and I wish I didn't have to put the pads in each time I wash it. It at least doesn't make you look saggy like everything else I tried on. Good for work clothes especially.
5	1368921600	I've been forcing myself to wear my pre-pregnancy underwire bras for awhile even though they have been so uncomfortable (35 weeks pregnant).  When I brought out my old nursing bras to wear I had quite a bit of relief, but was reminded that I wore most of them out last time (the hooks no longer worked or the elastic stretched out too much) and didn't spend much on them.  My splurge this time around would be fantastic nursing bras.I'm measuring a 36DD at the moment and purchased a size L...didn't even wait to wash it before I put it on.  At the end of the day I took the bra off and realized that I hadn't adjusted it during the day or felt uncomfortable once.  This is amazing as I had previously been either removing my bra half way through the day, or changing into something else because of discomfort.  The size large seems to be a little bit big on me, but I know that I'll be changing sizes in the coming weeks and it isn't uncomfortable at all, just a little bit loose.  I just ordered a second one in size Medium to see the difference.  I'll probably end up keeping both since sizing changes during pregnancy, birth, and weight loss afterward can be a bit dramatic.It makes such a difference to be comfortable while nursing (and in my case, before baby comes) that the price really is worth it.
5	1368748800	I am a first time mom and I bought this bra on my cousins recommendation.  I normally wear underwire bras but nurses at the hospital told me that a wire can cause clogged milk ducts.  I have tried other wireless bras and this is the only one that does not cause me pain on the sides.  Perhaps its because I am a D cup but I have never been able to wear anything without underwire.  The only thing I don't like is that the connecting strap is too long and there is not way to adjust it.  That makes re-hooking the bra with one hand (baby in the other) challenging at times.  This is a pricy bra but I am pain free so it is worth it.
4	1368748800	I have tried quite a few brands but this is the best so far. Great comfortable bra and holds your girls very well. I was 34dd pre pregnancy,but during my pregnancy my size has become 38F. I ordered M++ and can't say enough good things about the fit and soft cups. I am wearing bra on it's first hook so there is lot of room if I grow anymore (which I hope not). Easy to snap hooks for breastfeeding.  It looks good under clothes which matters to me a lot. GREAT BRA! I am already planning to buy in different colours. if you are on the fence, I would say GO for it.
3	1368748800	I picked my size based on the chart and even picked large, but still had to have the hooks on the loosest (third) setting and found that my breasts were pushed up and out. The &#34;pockets&#34; the bra offers for them do not seem to be for large-breasted women. Thankfully, Amazon is amazing about returns, so I've reclaimed my money and am headed to Nordstrom for a proper fiiting with many options to try, real-time.Thanks, Amazon, but this one just didn't do it for me.
5	1368662400	This bra was God sent at the end of my pregnancy. Excellent for sleeping but supportive enough for day time use also. It is very well made. You can buy a cheaper version of this bra at Target but with the reduction in price there is an obvious reduction in quality and support. I used one size larger during pregnancy and first 8 weeks postpartum. But now that I am nearing my per-pregnancy weight I am wearing a medium which is true to my bra size according to the sizing chart. My only criticism is that the material is not very breathable in warmer temperatures. Otherwise if supportive comfort is what you are seeking this bra is a great choice.
4	1368662400	The bra is pretty comfy, except for underneath, where it felt a little itchy. I just got it, though, and I'm 6 months pregnant so I am definitely more sensitive and have yet to find a bra that is truly comfortable. That said, I still need to learn how to work the nursing hooks, for when I need the bra for that purpose in a few months.
5	1368662400	Best nursing bra ever!! Supportive, incredibly comfortable, ease of use - I could go on and on.  Better than a lot of the 'popular maternity brands'. I wear a sleep bra at night and this during day. It's just excellent!Only downside was no size chart available.  Coulda used a medium, but will wear the large for now.
5	1368576000	I ordered this bra after already having bought two of the same kind at a local shop. The bra is very comfortable, especially compared to other nursing bras that I have tried on. The two features that I like the most are the clasps for nursing (which are easy to release and reattach with one hand) and the fact that the bra is unpadded (since nursing pads are padding enough!) The lack of an underwire is also nice, as the band at the bottom provides plenty of support.
5	1368576000	Support and stretch which is so important with the ever changing size of my nursing breasts! Plan on getting a couple more.  Worth the price.
5	1368144000	Really love this bra! It's so soft and comfortable. I highly recommend it. At first, I tried a cheaper nursing bra from Lamaze, and it's just not even comparable in terms of cushioning and comfort. Spend the extra dollars to buy a good nursing bra like this one, because it makes a huge difference especially when you begin nursing.
5	1367971200	I was having a lot of trouble finding a nursing bra, as my breasts vary in size depending on fullness. This bra is great: excellent support and comfortable. It has enough elasticity to accommodate your changing breasts.
4	1367884800	By far, the most comfortable nursing bra I've tried. I own several Playtex and Vogue nursing bras. This one doesn't make me look like I'm wearing a nursing bra. Also, comfortable enough to sleep in.
5	1367884800	Hands down the most comfortable nursing bra I've ever had. It looks great under clothes and is very supportive.  I'm using it with my second baby and wish I had known about it for my first. The only thing I would wish for is a lower cut version of this bra.
5	1367798400	Pros: I can wear this for 24 hours without getting uncomfortable. I also love how stretchy it is. It grows with you. The pink is light enough that it works under most tops.Cons: Kind of expensive. Does not work well with low-cut tops.
5	1367798400	Terrific support for a bra without underwire support. The fit is just as expected! East wash & care. A must have
5	1367625600	Why did I wait til 35 weeks pregnant to buy this bra?  It is incredibly comfortable.  I am a 36DDD and the Large fits me perfectly. Underwire in my bras were starting to really get uncomfortable because they would push into my belly when I sat down.  This bra is perfect - it provides enough support to make my boobs look good during the day at work (I don't look saggy at all), and it is incredibly comfortable at the same time.  I will be buying more!!
2	1367625600	Was hoping this bra would be more supportive than the sleep bras. Not so. The sizing is all wrong. The medium was way too big and I wear a 34dd. It was sent back.
4	1367452800	I like this bra alot and it is very comfortable. My only complaint would be the removable pads. I ended up just taking them out as they kept getting crumpled when in the bra.
5	1367452800	tried multiple bras, this one is the best.best support, not stretching after 6 months of use. No marks on my body, other bras leave terrible red marks if I use them overnight, but not this one. And I can wear almost everything, because this thing is not huge and not visible underneath my clothes. Also super easy to feed - just one easy clickI bought a couple of similar bras of different colors and can highly recommend this product.
4	1367280000	This is a VERY comfortable bra. Unfortunately it's not super supportive for these huge girls (38DD). Really though, anything without underwire isn't going to hold them up and separate them properly. That said, it's SO comfortable, I don't care. I have a different bra if I need to go somewhere and care if I have 2 boobs instead of 1.
5	1367280000	Love this bra! It soft, comfortable and offers good support :) it is a little pricey but it is far superior to any other (less expensive) nursing bras that I've tried. Nursing my second baby and a good nursing bra is a must and worth the investment.
5	1367280000	I tried a few other bras and this is hands down the best. Pre-pregnancy I was a 32D, I am much larger than that now and this bra provides support, but is soooooo comfortable (I sleep in it too), I bought a few. I am going back to work soon and this bra is great because it is not bulky under clothes. Buy it, you will not regret!
5	1367280000	This is the most comfortable, simple, soft, easy to use bra I've found.  It's totally worth every penny.  Use the fit guide to select size.
5	1367280000	This is a super comfortable bra. I was looking for a nursing bra that was &#34;wire free&#34; and this one is awesome. Was one that was recommended by my lactation consultant too.
5	1367020800	I've tried on a handful of nursing bras, and this one is both very comfortable and supportive.  I would highly recommend it.
5	1367020800	I love these bras, they are so comfortable and I am very picky about comfort.  Plus, they look really nice and have surprisingly good support for no underwire.  (And IIm a larger chested girl).
5	1366848000	As a person who has tried on (And hated!) what feels like 99.9% of the nursing bras on the market, I was very skeptical about the Bravado bras. The price point is one of the highest for nursing bras, and for me there was no choice but to purchase online - no in-store options available. That being said, I was exceptionally surprised and pleased to discover this bra by Bravado! This is the most comfortable bra I've ever worn - gorgeously soft cotton, enough support and shape to avoid the sports bra 'uni-boob' look, and incredible comfort from the straps and clips on the back. Also, the sizing allows for a fit of 2-3 different bra sizes to accommodate changes in the breast during maternity wear and post-partum.This bra is absolutely worth the extra $ compared to other nursing bras - I will definitely be purchasing more!
5	1366848000	There is a reason this bra has been purchased and reviewed by hundreds of people: it's a must-have nursing bra.  Originally I bought the Elle MacPhearson nursing bras available at Nordstrom.  The clerk there incorrectly sized me and the bras felt flimsy when they arrived in the mail.  Their design was flawed, in that the panel that opened onto the breast left a bit too much breast covered.The Bravado nursing bra opens exposing the entire breast, which is helpful, especially in early nursing days when baby and mom are finding their way.  It's also helpful when you're out and about because it's easier to get the baby to the right spot when they're under a Hooter Hider or other cover.  The fabric is soft, breathable, and absorbent.  The fabric does crinkle after milk dries on it, so having more than one bra or having one of their nursing bras along with a couple nursing tanks is helpful so all can be frequently washed.The clasps are incredible.  These people really thought about how to put together a nursing bra that both is easy to use and also sturdy enough to be worn around without fear of one of the flaps falling down.  A personal story about the quality of the product: my dog somehow got to the bra and chewed on one of the plastic clasps that holds up one of the panels.  I was devastated.  Then I remembered the bra also comes with a conversion kit which allows you to continue to use the bra after you're done with nursing, so I had a peek at the contents of the conversion kit.  I was able to use one of those pieces to hold up the bra and it's been working *almost* as perfectly as the original clasp ever since...for a couple months now.  I was loath to spend another $50 on a nursing bra, but I didn't have to!  The product is really solid and great quality.Finally, on sizing: call Bravado and they will help you figure out your perfect size.  They were so helpful to me!  And they can also help you figure out just what you'll need to have after baby arrives.
5	1366848000	I tried 4 different nursing bras, all designed by Bravado. The other three were Medela brand. I found this to be the most useful because it unsnaps very easily and fits comfortable. It holds a nursing pad better than the other types I tried. I also find the padding to be necessary so that the nursing pad doesn't look lumpy through clothing and to obtain adequate nipple coverage.
5	1366761600	This bra is a bit pricey but it was highly recommended to me. The package says it's designed to melt onto your body and that what it does! I'm currently wearing it 8 months pregnant and unlike any other bra, it's actually comfortable. I'm a 38B which is medium on the package but I'm wearing the medium on the last hook and it's a tiny bit snug so it might run a bit small in band size. If your measurements are on the line between M and L, go with L.
2	1366675200	I ordered the XL because it said for size DDD (F), which I am not yet because my milk has not come in. It was way too small and I was spilling out the sides. And it had zero support. Not good for larger busted ladies.
5	1366675200	As far as nursing bras go, this one is great. It is made of a stretchy material so it changes in size to accommodate your ever changing nursing breast size. You won't bust out of it when you are full of milk, and it won't be to saggy baggy when you are empty. It's comfortable, easy to wash, and holds up to 24/7, 12 months of wear and tear.
5	1366416000	I tried several different types of nursing bras, this one is by far the most comfortable bras I have worn. It gives good shape as well. The optional padding is great when you need it.
3	1366329600	These are quality bras and will last me through my (intended) 1 year of nursing. The clips are not as easy to snap off. They are also cut small so I wish I had ordered a bigger size as these squish my boobs towards each other.
5	1366329600	This bra is very confortable, soft and last but not least, it is beautyful. You may feel good and nice in this period.
5	1366243200	I have struggled to find a comfortable nursing bra and finally decided to order this one based on the good reviews.  I am very happy with it.  It is very comfortable, looks good under my clothes, and is easy to unsnap.  I do have to tuck a wash cloth over the top of the pulled down bra cup when nursing because my baby is a messy eater and the cup gets all wet, but I think that would happen with any pull down cup.  This is probably the most comfortable bra I have ever owned.  I just ordered another one because I am so happy with it.
5	1366243200	I figure if you are not buying formula for your baby then you can spend the cash on an awesome nursing bra.  The fabric is nice and soft on sensitive breasts and the clasped are easy to use.  The light pink color is nice and has some color, but still can be worn under light colored shirts.  This is my second one of these bras and I'm thinking of a third.
4	1366156800	Beautiful color ( bought turquoise and purple ones ), works functional, very comfortable to wear, need to wash by hand delicately
5	1366156800	I've bought cheap nursing bras in the past (this is my 4th baby) and I have always regretted it.  It killed me to spend so much on a bra, but when I really thought about it I am wearing these things for a year while I nurse, and cost per wear makes them TOTALLY reasonable.  Comfortable enough to sleep in and wear all day.  Perfect.
5	1366156800	I did a lot of research on nursing bras in preparation for my baby's arrival next month. I haven't used it as a nursing bra yet, but it is very easy to unsnap so I am sure it will be perfect. I've been wearing it all day today and it is super comfortable, it feels like you don't have anything on. It is also very light weight and soft. The best part I found is the elastic that is inside the bra that allows it to attach does not leave any marks on your breast. I am ordering two more today!
5	1366070400	I wish i would have found this bra when I was pregnant, it would have come in handy. Very comfortable. Not a whole lot of separation, but is wireless so I didn't expect much. All the same, I can wear it in public and feeding with it is easy.
5	1365984000	It fits perfect for me, and it's very comfortable. You can wear it every day even if you're not nursing. I'm planning to buy more, and forget about the VS bras. Plus, it's a sexy bra.. it shows your sexy cleavage just like the VS bras.
5	1365984000	Great product. Super comfortable. Shipped on time. Exactly what I was looking for. I'm ordering another one. I highly recommend it.
5	1365724800	I was looking for comfort but did not want that sports bra uni-boob look. I needed something to wear that didn't have an underwire. This is great! Super comfortable but has good support. I am a 34DD and have grown/swelled substantially. I ordered the large and it is perfect. Although, it is a big large it gives me room to keep growing. I still have 5 months to go.
5	1365724800	Great nursing bra! I was nervous about buying a generic size vs. width and cup size but the XL fits great and is so comfortable. Great support and totally worth the price. I wish I would have found this 2 babies ago!
5	1365724800	I can't believe I waited until I was 36 weeks pregnant to order a nursing bra. This model is super comfy and stretchy. I am now about a 36DD and ordered the L and it's perfect. I am really happy not to have underwires digging into my chest anymore.
5	1365724800	I LOVE this bra.  I had 3 of them during my last pregnancy and I wore them to death while nursing my son for a year.  I tried many other brands but this was the best I found.  I am pregnant with my second child now and bought one more of these bras.  They are super comfortable, they fit perfectly regardless if you change a cup size up or down. It does look like a bullet proof vest but if you are looking for a comfortable and functional bra this is the one to go with.  I took out the pads that come with it and used disposable ones the whole time.
5	1365638400	Usually you can only find this in beige or black. Having some interesting colors is nice and makes it seem more like a regular bra. She's been using the bravado bras since she began nursing and highly recommends them.
4	1365206400	I liked this bra and the only thing that I would change on it is how far up the clips are on the bra cups and that it shows when you wear tank tops.  Almost like wearing a sports bra  but very comfortable and barely know that it is on because it is so supportive.  Would recommend to those that want comfort and support.
4	1365206400	I have - no idea - what the one and two star reviewers are talking about. I am in a C/D right now and get a bit bigger when my milk comes in and I am currently in my last month of pregnancy with my second son. The bra is supportive (if bought in the PROPER SIZE) and it also is very stretchy. Lets cut to the chase - I have saggy breasts. Not going to lie. It looks like two tennis balls in some tube socks. This bra keeps them up. I feel comfortable wearing it outside of the house. It looks like a yoga bra. This isn't a bra for low cut tops, tank tops, etc. This is a TEE SHIRT BRA. REPEAT. TEE SHIRT.  Settle with the SUBLIME nursing bra for that tank top deal. And, if you need some extra support (bigger breasted) go for the BLISS. The soft cups ARE NOT - I REPEAT - ARE NOT THIN. They are typical SEAMLESS foam cups. They do not bunch, wrinkle (I hand wash my foam cups and DELICATE WASH my bras on COLD and HANG DRY). This bra is worth the money if you get properly sized, get bras that fit your shape and breast shape. I couldn't be happier with my THREE silk seamless and my Bravado nursing tank tops. They are worth the money but these bras will give you uniboob in a tank top.  Also, customer service is superb.
5	1365120000	Finally I've found something comfortable enough to wear during the later stages of pregnancy that makes me forget I am wearing a bra. Soft, flexible, no seams showing through tops...I LOVE IT!! The pink color is perfect and doesn't show through. Can't wait to try it post baby for nursing.
5	1364947200	This is the only nursing bra I wear (I have three) after trying out several different brands and tanks. I rarely spend this much money on clothing, but if you will be nursing for a while it is worth it to spend money on yourself. Here are all the reasons why I love it:--Super soft material: I had a winter baby. The freezing cold air, coupled with my super-sensitive nipples, and an on-going case of thrush, made nursing very painful in the beginning. I found myself cringing at the idea of wearing a bra and spent most of my time topless or in a robe. Once I was ready to leave the house, this was the only bra that didn't make me want to scream when I put it on. Those of you who struggled (or are struggling) with nursing know what I am talking about. This is the bra for you.--Roomy cups: Sounds dumb to buy a bra that is too big, but you need room because your size changes throughout the day depending on if you are empty or full. Tight bras are very uncomfortable when your breasts are full.--Wide band: This is my favorite feature. It makes the bra more comfortable. It offers full support, without the wire. I am a C cup and my breasts are super heavy when full. I can't wear the nursing tanks during the day because there is not enough support. Some other reviews comment that this bra is not supportive enough. I think if you use the right hook in the back, you will be supported. Anything more supportive may compress your breasts or poke at your milk ducts (like wires) which is not good for your breasts.--Strap Snaps: Super easy to undo/resnap with one hand once you get the hang of it (I can't do this with my Bravado nursing tank).--Full coverage: Great if you need to use nursing pads--Long life: Comes with a conversion kit to change into a regular bra after weening (great news if this is your only or last kid - you can still wear your favorite bra!!). Also, I've heard that this is one bra you can buy during pregnancy that will grow with you. I didn't do this, but I wish I had.--Machine washable: very important with nursing bras
5	1364860800	This is the most comfortable nursing bra I have found yet!  This is my second pregnancy and last time I went to the expensive boutique - they never fit quite right and were expensive.  This one is reasonably priced and it's so comfortable!!  I am not exactly well endowed, but I am broad - so nothing seem to fit right.  This is stretchy and fit perfect right away.  What they don't tell you is that they give you instructions and clips to convert it to a regular bra when you are done nursing, what a great idea.  This is my second bravado body silk and I think i may get a third.Finally - thank you!
5	1364860800	It's the most comfortable nursing bra I've ever bought although I have to add an extension buckle to fit my chest better.
5	1364774400	very good item, and wears comfortable as expected. I'd like to recommend it to my friends and all those who need.
4	1364774400	I have not yet used the bra for nursing as my baby is not quite out yet. But for an initial review it may be helpful to know that if you are on the line of the sizing chart you will need to go a size larger. It is not the best sizing policy in something like a bra to just have small, medium, and large. The package has a chart like nylons. According to the chart I could have gone medium or large. Medium turned out to be too small, with the cups positioned too close together. Especially when first nursing small is not ok, so opt larger. The ice pink is a very light baby pink. There were some complaints in other reviews about the cup inserts being an odd shape. This might be partly due to the cup inserts becoming creased while in the package. I have laid them out to see if the crease straightens out.
5	1364688000	I hesitated busying this because it is more expensive than other bras and I am used to underwire bras. It is definitely worth it though. Here is why:** If you are still pregnant, once you start nursing your size changes drastically, and this bra will fit COMFORTABLY a wider range of sizes.** Doubles as a night bra** I am not a large bust women (was a 32C before pregnancy, now 36DD), and it fits very nicely...I mean it looks good when you are dressed and that is always a plus** It is incredibly comfortable** Very good quality and easy to washSo far I have not found a con to this bra. Will definitely recommend it.
5	1364688000	Great bra with easy snap removal for breastfeeding or pumping. I wear 36c and I bought the medium size. Yes it is expensive but it is a must have. I have two but I would like to have 5 or 6. I wear them everyday with my nursing pads. I just throw them in the washer and dryer like regular clothes when they need to be cleaned. They provide good support and they are cute too.
5	1364515200	And I've tried a lot of them! I love this bra. It is extremely comfortable and allows for quick and easy access when you have a very hungry and cranky baby. I've bought three of them and I'm sure I will continue to wear them even when I'm no longer nursing.
4	1364515200	Sizing runs large. I ordered a medium per the sizing chart but the band is still loose even on the tightest hook placement. If you are on the edge of either size- go smaller!!! Cups are soft and stretchy so bust size should fit in either. You just don't want a loose band when you need support!
3	1364515200	Not for Full Sized Women. If you are a size D or bigger, this will be too small for comfort.  I bought it because I am a D and it said it would fit even larger and I was not completely satisfied with the coverage.
4	1364428800	I like the range of colors and to comfortable fit. However, the shape is not as good as Pea in the Pod.
4	1364428800	This was my first nursing bra. It's super comfy but it doesn't really give me the lift like my old regular bras. I think comfort is more important than cleavage right now anyway.
5	1364342400	This is the most comfortable bra I've ever owned. I'm not nursing anymore and I still wear this bra. It worked great for nursing, was easy to snap on/off with one hand. The bra is very supportive. I love it!
3	1364342400	Original: This is a very comfortable bra and it fits nicely under my clothes. I consider this a very good purchase.UPDATE: previously I only owned this bra in butterscotch (nude). I loved it so much I ordered it in black. I was disappointed because the pads that came in the black bra are different than the pads that came in the butterscotch bra- and the pads in the butterscotch bra are MUCH better in shape and fit the bra better.I'm going to contact the company and see if they will send me the other pads.
4	1364256000	This is a good maternity bra, but I wish the XL was bigger, I still struggle with it to cover up my entire chest which is disappointing.  Even though it isn't perfect, it is the best bra I have been able to find.
5	1364256000	Worth the money. I have four of these in different colors. I take out the padded liners (I don't have let down/leak problems). Easy to snap one handed, and hold up well in the washer/dryer.
4	1364169600	This bra is so comfy and supportive! I like the padding for a little shaping and nipple cover-up. The pads do come out in the wash, so you just have to stuff them back in after they air-dry. No underwire to irritate/compress milk ducts is nice! Easy to clip and unclip for nursing. Soft fabric!
1	1364169600	I tried this on and bought it in a store. The Large fit just fine before my milk fully came in (36D at time of purchase).  However, once my milk came in it stretched out way too easily and became huge on me, even though with milk I was like a 36H/J.  The flimsy, stretchy fabric offered no support for my breasts whatsoever, even with the straps fully tightened, and permanently stretched out under their weight.  Also, after a couple washes it looked like it had gone through several years of abuse. After a couple months I caved and bought another, more supportive nursing bra (same price range, maybe $5 cheaper; similar no-wire, just stretchy fabric concept) and kept this one as an emergency back up.  Maybe this is better for breasts that are mostly sagging and not so full of heavy milk.
4	1364169600	Easy to snap on and off, washes well and comfortable to wear. Not the most flattering but chose fit over looks.
5	1363910400	This bra is comfortable, and good quality. Sizing is accurate. Love the colors, I got the plum. I read the reviews and tried to find one less expensive, but in the end got this and couldn't be happier. I'd wear it everyday if I could, and the removable pads will be great eye I go back to work and want more "coverage."
2	1363824000	As a woman with larger breasts, this bra was very disappointing. Sag city! It is already packed up and ready to head back to Amazon. May be a super comfy bra, but I'd rather not go around looking 50 years older for comfort's sake.
4	1363824000	I went by the appropriate measurements and this bra was way too small. Had to return it and get a bigger size.
4	1363824000	The wide ban provides great support but has a tendency to bunch up under the arms.  The shoulder straps are good but don't provide the best support for large breasted women.
5	1363824000	I really love this bra,  it's so comfortable and the removable pad/ liner is a great feature.  It hides absorbent leak pads great,  but I remove from the  actual bra lining and just stuff them in because they tend to bunch.
3	1363824000	Other reviewers said that the cut was low enough to not be seen under most clothes. However, I find that even though the cut may go down far enough in the center, the sides of the center of the bra (if that makes sense) are not easy to hide if you have a basic scoopneck or vneck.
5	1363737600	Finally bought this bra when breastfeeding baby #1 after a bunch of much cheaper, but uncomfortable bras. This bra is so comfy, easy to wash, and has removable pads. Now nursing baby #2 and exclusively bought Bravado designs products, including 2 of these bras. So worth the money if planning on nursing for a long period of time.
5	1363651200	I live in Brazil, and thought hard to find a good nursing bra since I have large breasts.I bought this bra and I found comfortable, and that shapes the breast. I loved it!
5	1363651200	supports well, materials feels good against the body. I like it a lot! I appreciate that the adjustment is located on the top of the shoulder and not all the way at the back, makes it easy to adjust.
2	1363651200	I bought this bra based on all the great reviews.  I started out as a small A cup and am now probably a full B, so I bought the size small.  The removable cups are ridiculous, it looks like I stuffed small plates into the bra, the edges were obvious and noticeable no matter how I moved the foam around.  Definitely NOT seamless with the padding in it and I felt exposed when they were out. Also the sides and back come up very high, which while I know friends who love that, for someone of my bust size it's not necessary and feels silly. The only thing it has going for it is that it is very comfortable, but if you've got small girls to begin with I would find something else.
1	1363564800	I thought I will get what I paid for and 300++ reviewer that gave this product 5 star can't be wrong. But I was wrong. The bra is uncomfortable  (it's not made of cotton). The sizing is off. I wear 36B and M is too small for me. I always want to take it off when wearing it because it is too tight. I regret spent almost 40 buck on it. Too expensive for the quality.
5	1363478400	This bra is super comfortable and easy to use as a nursing bra. I purchased the Dark Plum first, then decided to get a 2nd one in Butterscotch. I have other nursing bras but the Bravado is now what I use exclusively because of it's comfort. I'm a usually 36B and the small fit nicely even post pregnancy. Highly recommended!
5	1363305600	The material is excellent and it fit perfectly. I am a 34D and a Medium size fit perfect. Seems like a bra that will last
5	1363219200	For a first time mom, this is my favorite and most comfy bra post-baby. I need to get another one...
5	1363219200	this is the best nursing bra I have ever owned. so comfortable. it was the only one that I have found that doesn't have wires yet still supports the girls sufficiently.
5	1363046400	I'm using this at 7 months pregnant. I wish I'd bought it sooner. It was my first nursing bra purchase. It's so comfy. It surprisely gives good support. I'm a 36D and I ordered a medium, but I probably would have been even more comfortable in a large. Great bra though!
4	1363046400	My wife is really enjoying really the bra. She told me it's much more comfortable than she expected, she hasn't had her baby yet, so i cannot comment on the ease of use of the straps as yet..
2	1362960000	I read all the great reviews about this bra and was very excited to get it. However, this bra does not do anything for your body. Besides nice material and comfort, the bra is completely unflattering, giving your boobs weird shape, being cut way to high (so no low cut tops), and not to mention hilarious removable padding that is completely visible and just looks ridiculous. I am sorry to say, but no woman who cares about looking good and feminine will wear this (except overnight in bed).
4	1362700800	The color is as shown in photo, bra is comfortable and snap release for cup is easy to use. It has washed well in cold water with Dreft.
3	1362614400	This bra is super comfortable when you put it on, but tends to stretch a lot durign the day.  I am constantly adjusting the band making it tighter and pulling it down in the back.  I wore a 32DD before pregnancy and am in a 32F after.  I tried both a small and a medium.  The medium band was way too loose (on the tightest hook to start) so I went with the small.  At the end of day if I bend over I tend to fall out since the cups don't fully keep me in after being stretched.
5	1362614400	This is very comfortable and comes with extra padding inserts that can be taken out. I am a 36-38DD and I ordered a large. It fits perfectly.
5	1362528000	This bra is so comfortable. I normally wear a 36B and I got a size medium. Fits perfect. I highly recommend this bra!
5	1362528000	Great nursing bra. My favorite one of all the ones I have. It's comfy and I can sleep in it, but also supportive. Removable pads give extra coverage too. Would recommend to first time nurser!
5	1362528000	This nursing bra is exactly what I was looking for. Comfortable, easy to snap with one hand and looks good underneath my clothes. I am typically a size 6/8 and 34D bra and I ordered this in a large and it fits just fine.
5	1362441600	Easily the best nursing bra I have. It's so comfortable that I even wear it to sleep. I like that it isn't &#34;sized&#34; so that it doesn't feel too tight when I'm engorged and it doesn't feel too loose when I'm empty. I wish it wasn't so expensive or I would buy two more. As it is now I'm only upset with it when it's dirty and I can't wear it.
4	1362441600	I really like this bra - no underwires, very comfortable for day and night, smooth, nice material that holds up in the wash. The only thing I would say is it's not super supportive, but not terrible either. It's still my favorite of any I have tried.
5	1362441600	I haven't tried any other brands, as these were recommended to me by a friend, but I ordered two initially and just ordered two more. They are comfortable and really easy to snap down for nursing. I was a 34DD pre-baby, and I would guess that I am now probably two cup sizes larger, and the large fits perfectly. They are comfy for during the day and also for sleeping, which is nice not to have to change bras. I was happy to find these because there weren't many options for larger sizes in the maternity stores.
5	1362355200	Bras by Bravado better then Medela.  I used different models of both. The bad thing is there is no white bra.
5	1362182400	For a product that is somewhat annoying by nature this is a great one!  It's very comfortable, the straps don't slide off, and the clasps relatively easy to fasten even with one hand.
5	1362009600	Much more comfortable than the 4 other types I've tried. I can even sleep in it, if I want. I wish the lining was built in, but it's not too much of a pain to fix the pad after washing. A built in lining might also provide a little more support. Easy to unsnap and redo with one hand, but the pad can get twisted in the process. I originally purchased on in a breastfeeding resource center, and they said it's great because the cups stretch/compact with your changing size. I've only worn these for the past 14 months while my son has been nursing.
5	1362009600	Worth the price, it still fit when my milk came in.  Just ordered another one I love wearing it so much , makes breast feeding much more comfortable.
5	1361923200	Comfortable and beautiful, with great support. Has extra padding, which helps prevent leakage if nursing pads get wet. I got an XL while pregnant (no other bra would fit!), and now continue using while nursing.
5	1361923200	Excellent nursing bra, nice and comfortable.  Bring it to the hospital, it helped ease engorgement pain to wear it those first few days.
5	1361923200	This is comfy and supportive. Currently I'm not using it for nursing, I'm using it during my pregnancy. But the snaps look like they're quality and will function great when I am nursing.
5	1361836800	I ordered a Medium (I'm 38C) to use as a comfy sleeping nursing bra and this is just perfect.  It fits great and is so much more comfortable than the cheaper bras that I was wearing.  I am definitely going to order more!
4	1361836800	Love this bra, its super comfortable, it doesn't pain me any where, and can wear for a very long day. I feel like I look normal when I wear it (unlike most nursing bras where the main function is support, this has both support and shape).The only thing I would change is the connector strap that hold the bra strap to the bra (the one that's inside the cup); I would love to see it made a little bit heartier, it gets stretched out during the day so wile pumping or nursing it slips down. Conversely though it doesn't put a lot of pressure on the breast that leaves the ducts feeling plugged....I also wish the nude was a little bit more darker hue to be a little "sexier" like the victoria secret color instead of light sandy khaki tan... but whob know maybe its available to buy and I missed it.All in all great bra and I plan to buy a few more! :-)
5	1361750400	I'm normally a 32-34 D, and towards the end of my pregnancy, I really started to swell. I got a M, and it is perfect. Not sure if I'll still be wearing the Medium once Baby is born and my milk comes in, but for the past couple of months, the M has been perfect. Supportive and comfortable.
5	1361577600	I was nervous about purchasing these bras without trying them on first. BUT, I love this bra! It is very soft and fits against my body smoothly. There is also plenty of room for when my milk comes in. I also ordered the Bravado New Original Nursing Bra and I will be sending that one back in exchange for another one of these. This seamless body silk bra fits and feels so much better. I would recommend this bra over the Original Nursing Bra.To help anyone with sizing questions: Pre- pregnancy I was a 36B... I have been wearing a 36C throughout my pregnancy... I ordered a size Medium and I am 32 weeks along. It fits perfect now and has more room to "grow into" once my milk comes.
3	1361491200	I followed the sizing recommendations exactly and ordered a Medium (I was/am a full 36C, my VS bras still fit in the cup so I would not guess I have gone up more than 1 cup size if any)  I'm 29 weeks pregnant and my milk hasn't even come in yet.  This bra was way too tight, my girls were squished.  Had to return it.
5	1361491200	I really like this bra! Haven't used nursing function because baby is not here yet. I wanted to put it on now to see how comfortable it was. So comfortable!!M I am definitely going to like this one!
5	1361491200	I have a few of these bras and wear them day and night. They are incredibly comfortable and the design is functional for pumping / feeding.Highly recommended for those looking for a comfy, comfy nursing bra!
5	1361491200	This the the most comfortable bra I have ever had- and I am not just talking most comfortable nursing bra. I love that it comes with clips so you can make it a &#34;regular&#34;bra when you don't need it to be nursing any more
5	1361404800	Just what I expected, higher quality than similar one I found at Target.  Cup size a little large but should be perfect once baby arrives.
4	1361404800	I don't have a lot of experience with nursing bras, I actually only have one other one besides this one. However, I have to believe for the price that there are better ones out there. This one is pretty comfortable, except for the straps. They need to be wider with more cushion, especially in the larger sizes. They are pretty skinny and rough and even itchy. I am normally a 34dd, but right now, I am 35 weeks pregnant and am a 36/38 E(DDD) The large fits. I don't like the way it makes my breast look, not real flattering. No real support. Pads look bad too...Update- I washed this and took pads out. I like it much better! It is softer now and looks smooth. I use this one all the time. I still want more support, if I am going out, but for most of the day this is good and comfortable!
5	1361318400	I bought this during my last pregnancy because all of a sudden, it seemed like not only my boobs but my entire chest expanded! I couldn't bear underwire bras and everything in the store, even wireless bras, felt too tight. I wanted something not restrictive that I could wear everyday. I tried on so many maternity bras, but again, the rubber lining around the chest band was so uncomfortable. I am so glad I found this one (and also the Majamas Easy Bra). Both are perfect.This bra does not offer support, but honestly, they were firm and didn't need support. What it did offer was the ultimate comfort. I could breathe easily every day at work. A life-saver. Btw, pre-pregnancy I was around a size 36D and found the XL to be just right.Then of course after my baby was born, this bra was the perfect nursing and pumping bra! It easily unhooks without an issue. It has been through so many loads of laundry and has upheld well. No snags, no tears, no signs of heavy wear. This is a perfect bra and I absolutely love it. I am on baby #2 and started wearing this right away. No need for anything else!
5	1361232000	I say this it's totally worth the money. I have first bought the target Gilligan o maley bra and it was `okay` but it bulked on side. this bra is definitely comfortable, provides support and fits great. I can't seem to undo the snap footer nursing with one hand but I'm sure there's a technique to it
5	1361232000	Comfortable, breathable, easy to unhook to feed and looks good under clothes.  I will be buying more in different colors!
5	1361232000	My breasts have gotten bigger (of course) since I have been pregnant and I was looking for replacement bras that I could wear throughout the rest of my pregnancy as well as for breast feeding.  After some research, i found these bras and boy am i glad!  While they are not as low-cut as some of the other more stylish bras, i am still able to wear them with all of my lower cut shirts.  They are very comfortable, and I don't notice any difference with them being a nursing bra as well.  The nursing function seems to work well.  I have played with it a bit to be sure that it was easy to use (and it is) but I can't tell you how it will be when actually breast feeding.  Athough, I am sure that it will work great.  The bras also come with a little kit to change them into regular non-nursing bras when you are done, just in case you don't like the quick detach feature.  I would definitely buy these again, and just might when these ones are worn out!
5	1361232000	Let me preface my review with this: I hate nursing bras. I had yet to find one that was comfortable, functional, and made my chest look somewhat attractive. Usually the comfy ones make result in major sagging. I'm a 38D and bought the medium in this. This bra is great! I really love it, and I can wear it after weaning, too. I can't believe how supportive it is, no sagging bra after a few hours! It seems like a miracle, given there is no underwire. The band under the cups seems very thick and durable, for lack of a better word. The bra itself has shape if you hold it up, which again, I haven't seen in a seamless wireless nursing bra. This is probably due to the removable foam cups on the inside that line the bra, and they are actually large enough to stay in place (I have another bra with tiny foam cups that shift frequently. This bra does not). I have a similar looking bra that I got at the mall, but it doesn't hold up nearly as well after 18 hours of wearing it during the day. I feel like I look great in this bra, definitely worth having several. Highly recommend, again, by someone who has about 10 other nursing bras because I could never find one that fit right, made me feel attractive, and was comfortable except this one. Washes very well, too. Very impressed!
4	1361145600	The bra is very nice and soft.I gave it a four because the sizing was not easy to figure out.However I am keeping this item as its very comfortable for nursing.
5	1361145600	i have hated all of the nursing bras that I've purchased besides this one.  I wear it to bed.  great!
5	1360886400	Doesn't ride up and the straps don't fall down...Comfortable enough to sleep in, tooI haven't tried out the nursing feature on a regular enough basis since baby isn't here yet, but the strap was easy enough to pull down that I think it should work out just fine.
3	1360886400	These bras are comfortable, but I don't think they give a very good shape. I would like it better it the cup was firm.
2	1360800000	Given the great reviews, I thought I'd give this bra a try. The recommended size for me was way too small and gave me a uniboob. Returned it.
3	1360800000	this is a little pricey for something not so exciting.  It does get the job done though i guess.  decently comfortable.
5	1360713600	I just love this nursing bra- another great one made by trusty Bravado. I have never had an issue with any Bravado bra I have owned, but this nursing bra is by far the most comfortable!
4	1360713600	In my quest for a more supportive nursing bra, these fit the bill.  I've purchased many different nursing bras at Target...they either lost their elasticity within a few washes and were not supportive at all.  These are so supportive and the removable pads are a plus if you need to wear disposable nursing pads.  They cover them completely.Other reviews state these bras don't look like the picture, but I completely disagree.  If you are a B/C cup then these look exactly like the picture.  I can see if you are larger, then it might look different.  Would recommend these bras.
4	1360713600	This bra is very comfortable and supportive. However, it is a little tricky to unhook one handed (which is helpful when nursing a hungry baby). However, I haven't found a better nursing bra than this. I am size 34D and the medium size fits me well.
5	1360713600	I searched for a long time for a good nursing bra.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money, so I ended up trying and returning several bras.  I finally realized that to get something I could actually wear all day I needed to spend a bit more money.  I'm so glad I did.  This is the most comfortable nursing bra I have tried and still gives a nice shape under tighter shirts.  I will spend the money to buy another one!
5	1360713600	This is by far the best nursing bra!  It feels like a sports bra.  It supports very well and makes breastfeeding a breeze.  The removable pads are amazing at preventing any &#34;show.&#34;  Plus, they absorb small leaks.
1	1360627200	This bra is not actually suitable for your 40+ DDs as the sizing indicates.  I'm falling out of it more often than not.  I like my $10 genie bras much better and get more support from them.  Don't waste your money if you have a large bust.
5	1360627200	I had tried several nursing bras, and hated all of them: there was either too much support/coverage that it made it difficult to nurse it, or there wasn't enough that I felt comfortable in public. With the removable pads and stretchy fabric, this bra has comfort, support, and versatility to be the perfect bra from pregnancy through nursing. My favorite feature is that when unclasped for nursing, the bra doesn't get in the way because of how it's made. I highly recommend this bra for anyone who wants to nurse on the go and feel comfortable doing it.
5	1360627200	I really like this bra. It fits great and washes great.  It's easy to open the closures and is very adjustable.
5	1360454400	I own 7 nursing bras, and this is by far the most comfortable.  It's my favorite bra for overnight wear because it's so flexible and comfortable, but it still offers a good amount shaping and support for daytime wear, especially for a bra with no underwire or molding.  Now that I am nursing, I am a 32E (I purchased a M for this bra), and I find this bra to offer adequate support.  However, women who like a lot of support might need a more rigid bra for daytime wear. Either way, I would still recommend this bra to all nursing women - even if you only use it at home just because of how comfortable it is.Also, the nursing clips are super easy to open and close.  And the bra comes with conversion kit so you can remove the nursing clips and still use the bra after you no longer breast feed.
5	1360454400	Love this bra! Most comfortable bra for nursing ever and it's supportive. You can't even feel it when wearing it.
1	1360454400	The bra was not what I thought.  It was not attractive or supportive and did not fit well.  I am returning it.
4	1360368000	This bra is super comfy and convenient for breast-feeding at home or on the go, though after a few hours it does allow for a bit of a uni-boob effect. The turquoise color is perfect, just as it looks in the picture. Ordered a large the first time according to the measurements on the back, but it was a bit tight and so I returned it and got an extra large, which is working out much better.
5	1360368000	This just arrived today and so far I love it. I am a 38 DD and it fits well and offers good support.
5	1360368000	Comfortable, good support, convinient and good quality. I got a size small and fits perfect! It's so comfortable that after I bought the black one I knew I had to get more, so I did.
4	1360368000	While I wish it were prettier and not so industrial looking, I have to say the comfort factor is outstanding. I went from a B cup to a DD after my baby and a medium fits me perfectly. The clips operate easily. My favorite part is how supported I feel without any wire. The design is pretty genius if a bit boring. I guess that's why it comes in such a wide variety of colors.
5	1360368000	This was by far my favorite nursing bra.  So comfy and looks great under clothes.  It is expensive, but worth every penny.  I highly recommend it.
5	1360281600	This nursing bra is so comfortable and really gives you great support. It washes very well. I have one in every color.
5	1360195200	At the start of breast feeding when your breasts are sore and tender this bra is a godsend.  It moulds around you without constricting your breasts but at the same time offers support.  Love my Hotmilk Bras but at the moment I would choose to live in this one.
3	1360195200	I am a 34G while nursing and the L in this bra just didn't cut it. No support and the cups weren't big enough, which is generally the issue with S,M,L bras for me. Oh well...
5	1360195200	I am not looking forward to the day when I am no longer nursing/pumping and need to hang up this bra. It is SO comfortable. Perfect to sleep in and to lounge around in. Highly recommend.
5	1360195200	This bra is fantastic. I own two of them (one in pink ice; one in nude) and that's all I've needed from third trimester on. The cup fabric expands/shrinks as needed; the straps are easily adjustable; the inserts are great for under t-shirts (I leave them in all the time); and the bra washes well (cold delicate cycle; line dry). It's a pretty simple design, stitched to last, and with durable fabric. Did I mention it's super comfortable? Don't waste time and money trying less-pricey bras; this one is worth the money.
5	1360108800	I love my Bravado nursing bra. Most bras that can you buy in local maternity stores, have bras that are Demi cut. This bra provides great coverage as well as being stylish and comfortable. Love it, buy it!!
5	1359936000	I bought size M (34B pre-pregnancy) I'm on 25th week.Made in Mexico, Canadian brand.It doesn't look fashion but very comfortable. I have a back pain so this type of bra is much better then the regular one.
5	1359936000	This bra is worth the investment. I was using standard, wire nursing bras and kept getting clogged ducts in the area where the wire was resting. My obgyn recommended that I find a wireless bra to alleviate some of the pressure that the wire was putting on me. I bought this bra and NEVER had a clogged duct again. They're comfortable, flattering and easy to snap on and off.
4	1359936000	I've read a lot of great reviews on this bra, but I wasn't sure what size to get. I was 34A pre-pregnancy, and now I'm about 36A-38A/B (so between small and medium on the chart). I am small-chested and I wasn't sure how the cup would look on me. I went with the medium because I didn't want any back fat oozing out. It definitely does not look like how it does on the model as I don't have enough to fill the cup. :) Another minor complain that I have is that when I'm wearing a tank top (or even a scoop-neck shirt), there is no hiding this bra. It is fairly comfortable, but I wouldn't wear it to sleep as others have suggested.
4	1359849600	I wish I had bought this bra sooner...much more comfortable than the cheaper ones available at maternity stores...and I'll probably be using it long after I stop nursing. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect 5 stars is that I wish the clasp was slightly easier to undo with one hand...it's possible, but a requires a little extra effort. Other than that, so glad I bought one!
5	1359849600	This bra is by far my favorite nursing bra.  It is very easy to use, and very comfortable, it adjusts to fit a variety of sizes.  It comes with optional pads that you can put in.
4	1359763200	This is a very comfortable, nicely-constructed bra.  It fits nicely and is very supportive.  I always wear bras with underwire, but it is not needed in this one.  The only reason why I have it 4 instead of 5 stars is it should come in cup and chest sizes instead of just small, medium and large.  I am usually a 34D, but go up to a 34DD when nursing.  This put me right in between small and medium.  I chose medium and it is perfect in the cup size but I have noticed it is getting a little loose around my chest. I have worn it for 8 months, most everyday, so I am not too concerned, as it has held up better than any other nursing bra I have owned.
5	1359590400	This bra is great for any Breastfeeding mother. The material is soft and stretchy and has a very comfortable fit.
5	1359504000	This bra is a little more expensive than others, but the quality seems good so far. And it's comfortable and works well as a nursing bra, so I'm happy with it.
5	1359504000	I am a 38E and have looked everywhere for a bra that fit well.  It is so comfortable and provides the support I need.  The fabric is breathable and moves with me.  I love this bra and plan on buying another.
4	1359504000	I love this bra, I've pretty much been wearing it nonstop since I got it because at this point (38.5 weeks) it's the most comfortable one I have. The sizing was accurate--I got the Medium; I was a 34C before pregnancy and with 2 weeks to go before my due date, it's got room to grow without being huge on me now (I didn't really go up in size too much til this last month when my ribs have definitely expanded, making me more of a 36C-D); I do think it will be large enough, even in those first few weeks. It gives me good support without feeling constrictive. I haven't actually nursed with it yet, so I can't help as far as whether it's easy to undo, etc. though I've given it a try (albeit without a squirming infant in my arms) and I think I can manage it (hey, it may not be graceful but I'm not trying to win any awards here).All that being said, is this the bra I'd wear on my honeymoon? Noooo...it's not winning any beauty awards, and the pad inserts definitely leave something to be desired (though under most of my tops, I don't notice lumpiness with them in)--they definitely should be better designed, removed, or permanently built in. When you do reattach the strap after nursing they do need to be readjusted to look right, which I can tell will be annoying.
5	1359504000	I have two of these style bras, and one other (the Original). The silk seamless is WAY BETTER than the original. Much more comfortable, and it actually maintains the separateness of your breasts. The Original is more like a sports bra, with no back closure, and less shape in the cups. The silk seamless I have used since my son was 2 weeks old and I was able to get out of the house to get some nursing bras. They don't have underwire, but honestly I don't miss it. The shape is not quite what it would be with a regular underwire bra, but they are so much more comfortable. I was well endowed before pregnancy (36D), and I love the support of these bras. Highly recommended!! I wear a large.
4	1359417600	I don't know if this bra was worth the 40 dollars but it is super comfortable and the clips are the easiest I've found to work one handed. Will prob order another even though pricey
5	1359417600	I'm currently 39 weeks pregnant with my first child, so though I haven't yet used this bra while actually nursing, it was recommended to me by tons of nursing friends and I get to see it &#34;in action&#34; all the time while we're hanging out :)  I purchased these bras when I was about 18 weeks pregnant, because even though I was barely showing and haven't put on much weight even now at full term, what weight I've put on seems like its at least 80% in my boobs, hehe :)  I was a 34C pre-pregnancy but now am likely an E/F at least, if not bigger.  These bras have been supportive and comfortable all along, and I think they'll have room to stretch even during the first few weeks of engorgement.  The provided removable soft cups are great for adding shape and preventing nipple peek-through when wearing T-shirts.  I was an underwire gal before pregnancy, and was concerned that these bras wouldn't be supportive, but amazingly they are.  The nursing clips are also really easy to use, yet secure.  The butterscotch shade is great under any color tops - doesn't really show through.
5	1359244800	I've liked the Bravado nursing bras for a couple of years now, but I shied away from buying the &#34;butterscotch&#34; color because I'm so used to flesh-tone colors being too pink or too light or just, somehow, odd looking. I really quite like this one. I'm not going to claim that it perfectly matches my skin, but I will say that it's as close to invisible as possible under a sheer white shirt.Pros:- Good color- I like the way the entire cup detaches for nursing, unlike some that have a wide panel supporting the breast when open- The clasp is easy to use one-handed- The clasp doesn't come undone accidentally- 4 rows of hooks mean 2&#34; worth of band adjustments- These wear well. I wash them in lingerie bags and dry them flat.Cons:- These are more of a shelf-style than individual cups; things fall down the front and take up residence in my cleavage. (Anyone with a toddler will understand this.)
5	1359244800	Great fit and very comfortable nursing bra.  Provides excellent support however seamless under shirts.  Would recommend to all nursing mothers.
4	1359158400	Fits great, feels great.  Offers comfort, support, and separation compared to other similar styles.  Not crazy about the price, but quality in fabric and design is worth it.  I plan to wear while delivering!
5	1359072000	This bra is VERY supportive, comfortable for periodic nap taking (as it has no underwire), and hides inevitable leaks with the pad inserts.  I ended up buying another one as I liked this one so much! Awesome!
4	1358899200	I read the reviews and adjusted my bra size so it would fit accordingly. I haven't had my baby yet, but I'm 9 months. The bra is a bit on the small size...I have to wear it on the last clasp. Luckily the cups are stretchy with plenty of room. My suggestion would be to go a size bigger than you think. Right now I wear a 32-34 C cup and I got the medium, and it was too small, if that helps any. Apart from that, this bra is extremely comfortable and breathable.
4	1358899200	This bra is super comfortable. My only complaint is the molding cups don't wash real great and it sometimes feel like the bra hooks are up a bit high. But it is soft and a great color.
5	1358899200	Perfect around-the-house or sleep nursing bra. Very comfortable and love the removeable pads that I can use for a quick trip to town.
5	1358899200	I LOVE this bra! It is so incredibly comfortable, I can wear it during the day and sleep in it and it never bothers me. It's the first nursing bra I've owned and it's so incredibly easy to unclip and clip with one hand, truly effortless, which is SO important as a new nursing mother. I hand wash it and let it air dry, which only takes a few hours and leaves it perfect. I am a 36 DD and it provides good support. It's certainly not something I would wear for a night out, I'd want something with a but more push up support factor for that, but it's not designed for that. For what it's designed for, it is fantastic! Also extremely reasonably priced compared to many nursing bras.
5	1358899200	It's super comfortable and has great support. I only wish it came in bigger cup sizes as I am still pregnant and assume I will be needing a much bigger cup size once nursing.
5	1358812800	I have been wearing this bra (well, I have a few different colors now, but this same style of bra) pretty much nonstop for the last six months. I keep looking for other nursing bras and even have bought some others, but can't find any that have made me switch from wearing this one all the time.Reasons:1. It really is seamless and doesn't show under clothes (well, unless you get the turquoise color, which I have and love. Just use that one under colored shirts).2. It is so comfortable. Like, I wear it around the clock and I never used to wear a bra to bed, but now I don't even think about it.3. It holds up -- I have washed mine multiple times, and not always by hand (hey, when I'm tired and doing laundry, sometimes I just give in to temptation...) I do try not to put them through the dryer, however, and they do air dry quickly.4. No underwire but still lifts/holds the way you want a bra to do. No underwire also means that it doesn't restrict your milk production.5. Biggest reason of all: The sizing is a godsend. Really. When your milk first comes in, followed by the first few weeks of breastfeeding, you are going to be one giant size that is not easy to measure. (Also, there was no way that I was together enough to go to a breastfeeding supply store to get measured and fitted for bras in those first few weeks.) Having sizes that cover a range of cup and band sizes meant that I could add a small and a medium to my cart from the comfort of my living room and know that I was covered. This kind of sizing makes SO much more sense than trying to figure out a regular bra size when your breasts are anything but regular while breastfeeding.I wore the size medium for the first six months, and now that my body has gone sort of back to normal, I am now in a size small, so I am glad I have both sizes. Also, Bravado's customer service is fantastic. I am someone who buys her normal bras normally from that store with the big bullseye as its logo, so spending more on this bra was a big step for me but was absolutely worth it. I bought multiple nursing bras from that other store and ended up returning all of them because none of them came close to this one. Love it!
5	1358812800	Very comfortable, great quality, and looks nice (as nice as a nursing bra can look!). I highly recommend this product!
5	1358812800	This product is wonderful. I love the color too. The only thing I was surprised about is the number of hooks at the back. I ordered a Small and was surprised to find 3 hooks. This normally would be a deal breaker for me, but it is so comfortable I decided it was worth keeping.
2	1358726400	This bra came out of the box, got one try-on and went right back and got returned. What am I missing? I can't believe this bra has so many good reviews? This bra looks SO cheap and you can SEE the pad outlines on your boobs/under any shirt (i tried on a few). I went to a big red bullseye store and got one for half the price that looks about a million times better. The sizing seemed fine, the material was soft and it was easy to un-hook the front bits with one hand (which is the only reason it gets 2 stars). However, the quality of the pad inserts and the fit was just awful. I liked that it was wireless and the butterscotch/nude color would hide well under most tops (even white), but it had to go back! I don't need everyone looking at my bra pad outlines. Sorry, Bravado.
5	1358726400	I have traditionally purchased my nursing bras from Motherhood Maternity or Target, but I found that the bras I had from my first daughter were not fitting well when my second daughter was born recently.  As all nursing mothers know, your breasts are not the same exact size throughout the day and as your child ages.  At the beginning, there is the issue of engorgement, which makes fitting into most bras problematic.  (They fit fine when your breasts are empty, and you are popping out when they are full).  This nursing bra completely solves that problem because of the spandex-type material that stretches when you need it to.  On the flip side, it still fits well when you are on the empty-side.  I like that the bra doesn't have an underwire.  This is so much more comfortable when you have to flip the bra down to nurse.  Despite it having no underwire, I DO find it supportive enough and it gives me a pretty good shape.  The only thing I would say is that that cups in the bra do shift, but you can easily reach under the fabric to adjust as needed.  I don't know if I would wear this bra with a paper-thin, borderline see-through shirt, but it does fine with most of my clothing.  I would definitely recommend this bra.  It's honestly the only nursing bra I wear now.  It's a little bit more expensive than many nursing bras on the market it, but it was DEFINITELY worth it.  I usually wear a 34C - 34D and the medium fits well.  I could easily see it fitting smaller and larger women equally well because there are several settings to clip in the back.  Nursing moms, buy this nursing bra.  You won't regret it.
3	1358640000	The bra works well for nursing at night.  I don't use it during the day because it doesn't have much support.
5	1358553600	I am 3 weeks from delivery and I ordered this bra in order to get ready for breastfeeding.  When I put it on I decided I'll be wearing it until the baby comes! It really is that comfortable.  I haven't slept in it but I bet I could.  I love the hint of padding! I'm a 36B and ordered a medium- I definitely have room to grow in the cups and the band is just right.  I think I might order another color.
5	1358467200	Bought several nursing bras based on reviews. I wore the others a couple of times and couldnt stand them. I bought two more of this bra and am very pleased. They're not too tight or unstructured. They have inserts that keep your nipples discretely smoothed over and the clasps are easy to manage with one hand.
5	1358467200	Great product! Purchased 2 to start and I'm already ordering a 3rd. Easy to snap, comfortable, fits well! You cant go wrong with this nursing bra
5	1358380800	Great nursing bra!  Fit is very true to size and super comfortable which is key while nursing. I have 3 of them and love them and where them everyday.
4	1358294400	Overall I like this bra.  The fabric is really nice, the straps and closures seem sturdy, it washes well, and it's nice that it has a hook and eye closure in the back instead of having to go over the head like some others.  The only problems are that it doesn't come in an extra small (I'm about a 32C now I think, which falls in the small range on the size chart, but it is kinda big on me both in the band and the cup) and the athe removable cups are a totally weird shape.  The concept is good, but unless your breasts are really small and perfectly spherical than the cups just look funny.  I replaced them with some soft cups I had taken out of a bathing suit and it's much better now, but it's too bad they couldn't have just found a more natural shape cup to put in there.
5	1358294400	This is the most comfortable nursing bra I've used so far in my 22 months of nursing. It's supportive, yet the band doesn't feel restrictive in any position. I could even sleep in it. It's very easy to open and close the cups with one hand. Only caveat: It's not the sexiest little number on the market. It's actually a bit dowdy. But it gets the job done like no other I've tried.I've also tried the Gilligan ones from Target (decent support and a good value for the price, but can be a little uncomfortable around the band after a short while) and the Bliss Nursing Soft Cup (very attractive and uber-supportive, but it gave me plugged ducts every.single.time I wore it).
5	1358208000	I am in my third trimester and am at the upper end of Medium so i was a little nervous about the size when I ordered. I think this bra is going to be perfect for my last few weeks and into nursing. Very well made and very comfortable!
5	1358208000	great bra, very comfortable and light,  no bone, i would recommend this to buy. you could wear this after .
4	1358208000	My cousin recommended this bra so I ordered it to try it out. I didn't expect it to provide much support and lift because it wasn't an underwire but it certainly does! I plan on using the included conversion kit after I'm done breastfeeding to use it for everyday wear.My only improvement would be the included nursing pads. While they do prevent my nipples from showing through my clothing, they often require me to readjust them after nursing because they sometimes get folded within the bra pocket. I haven't figured out the best solution to this yet, but since it's so comfortable I'm definitely willing to keep adjusting them until I can figure out a better way to handle the roving pads.
5	1358208000	soft, beautiful ,good shape,I love it!This is the 2nd I bought, the 1st one is green ,this is pink ice. All beautiful!
5	1358035200	I tried so many nursing bras and tanks bravado makes the bet of both hands down. Easy up and down, comfortable, looks nice under clothes. It is a bit big and the snap is loud when You secure it but they are the best! Especially vs anything from gap maternity, maternity stores or target. The tanks are even better. I slept in one ever single night for the first 1.5 years of my kids lives while nursing. They are snug, cute if you don't want to change/can't find the time to change and they offer support. This company truly is made for the nursing mom, not just capitalizing on the market. I have 4 of each bras and tanks. They are worth the expensive price tag!!!!!!!
5	1358035200	I am extremely picky about bras so finding a decent nursing bra without an underwire was going to be a task. This bra is so much softer than other nursing bras and much more comfortable. Bought another in black.
5	1357948800	I already had this bra in black which I purchased at the gift shop at my hospital as it was recommended to me by the lactation nurse. It makes life so much easier and it is super comfortable. Unfortunately the hospital shop only had my size in black so I came online looking for other colors. I would highly recommend this bra for any nursing mothers.
4	1357948800	This bra has been been a lot more supportive than other non-underwire nursing bras that I tried with my last baby. And because of how it fits, I have no discomfort with size fluctuations throughout the day. It has also worked well with hooking my hands-free pump up to! I'm not crazy about the removeable pad... it wrinkles (which you can see through clothes) and is hard to get in so I leave it out. Overall, great bra, would recommend it!
5	1357862400	I had this bra in ivory for a previous child and loved it so much I ordered another.  It is super comfortable and easy to nurse with.  The included pads come in handy!
4	1357776000	This bra would be perfect for nursing moms that have a much larger cup size. Thick straps, high quality material make this bra super comfortable. I only gave 4 stars because according to size chart, I should be medium... But too big. Otherwise, love this nursing bra!
5	1357776000	Although I'm still pregnant, this is by far the best bra I've found to accommodate my growing assets. The stretchy band is also really comfortable, even though I'm carrying really high. It also provides enough support for the girls, even given that I wear a large cup size.
2	1357776000	It's well made, but the material is MUCH less comfortable than what you can get at the same price from A Pea In The Pod, which I highly recommend.
3	1357776000	I need coverage and the pads are really awkward. I do plan to wear it at night, though. Still searching for the perfect daytime nursing bra.
3	1357689600	This bra is super comfortable but as a 34E, I found it did not give me the support I needed after 12 weeks of breastfeeding. The back started to ride up which meant my boobs started to ride low. I like the idea of this bra, but at $50, you'd think it would give you the support needed for larger breasts.I think it works if you have small boobs.
5	1357689600	I love this bra.  I just ordered a second one in black.  The first one was the light pink.  A very nice light color to use under light colored shirts instead of the usualy nude/beige colors.  I only ordered one because I have tried many many nursing bras in all price ranges and none of them have ever been worthy of buying a second.  Some of them I just threw away.  I have tried Medela bras in several styles, Target bras in several styles, Motherhood Maternity bras in several styles, etc.  They all either hurt right away (underwire or rubbing) or later as they wore out, looked like crud after a few gentle cold-water washings in a lingerie wash bag (I never use the dryer), didn't offer decent support, were clumsy to use in public, or showed lumps and bumps either from the bra itself or the thin Medela disposable pads I used with them.  This bra has none of those problems.  I would have never ordered a non-underwire to use during the day or out and about given my size (I will share below) so I planned to use this just at home.  But it is so comfortable and fits so well that I wear it everywhere and all the time, even at night.  The rest of my bras are getting tossed.  I love the thin pads to hide the pads and provide a nice shape under clothes.  Although I have also used the bra without the pads and the fabric is so nice I almost don't need the removable pads anyway.  The fit is terrific for me and it is sooo comfortable.  No underwires to cause trouble now or later (although when not nursing all I wear is underwire) and no bad rubbing like some other bras do under my arms or on my back.  Also, the bra comes with some little conversion clips and instructions to use it after you are done nursing and don't need the fold down cup feature.  Clever.  If the bra was like my other nursing bras, I would have never thought I would use that feature, but it is so nice I will probably use it as a around the house and sleep bra when I am done nursing in a year.  I don't plan to have more children, but may buy a third & fourth of these just for rotation sake and color change.  I really wish I had found these with my last child.  For reference, I ordered a medium.  I wore a 34DD before getting pregnant, was slighly larger during pregnancy but made do with a few of my 34DD bras that fit a little larger.  When I get measured, they measure me as a 32G, but I like the fit of 34DD better.  I am 5'5&#34; and was 128 lbs before getting pregnant.  I'm 141 lbs now, 1.5 weeks after delivery.  I hope this helps.
5	1357603200	So I am 14 weeks pregnant with my second child.  As with my first pregnancy, my regular bras no longer fit because I go up 2 cup sizes (36/DDD). This is the only bra I have found that alleviates the back pain associated with not having the proper support. I had one and just bought two more to get me through my pregnancy and nursing. I have other nursing bras that I bought because they were not as ugly as these, but I do not wear them because I am uncomfortable within a few hours of putting them on.  This is not a &#34;cute&#34; bra, but does what it needs to do. I wear these with everything and just add a cami or bella band (to look like a cami), so the bra does not show under a low &#34;v&#34; neck.
5	1357603200	Of all my nursing bras, I wear this one the most.  The extra padding inside the cup is nice and helps in case a little leakage happens.  I probably should have gotten the next band size up but it's still comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this.
4	1357603200	This bra is comfortable and supportive. When I'm not actively nursing, I enjoy wearing it. However, it's difficult to fold the cups down to nurse because of the molded inserts. Removing them, as well as nursing pads, each time I want to breastfeed is too complicated. Also, I don't find the clasps very easy to use one-handed. The $15 nursing bra I bought at Target has better clasps. I'm not sure this bra is worth the price.
4	1357430400	I was really impressed with the quality and fit of this bra the only bad part is the removable pads were super wrinkled and didn't look right. I will have to wash them and see. But great bra! Oh it also comes with a conversion so when done breast feeding its a normal bra! Great idea.
5	1357344000	I bought my first Bravado nursing bra as a result of the good reviews on Amazon, and they didn't steer me wrong. I originally bought a medium in the butterscotch color, and wore it during my last couple months of pregnancy (I was a 36-C before pregnancy, and a 38-E during pregnancy) and while nursing. The medium fits all right, but can feel a bit tight at times. Thus, the next two bras I purchased were larges, and they fit wonderfully. I now have a black and a pink along with the nude (butterscotch), and those are all I need, along with a few nursing tanks. I have other nursing bras, but rarely wear them. I find these to be much more comfortable to sleep in than any sleep bra (including Bravado's, which itches me), and I love that if you leave the foam pads in, you can't see the cotton nursing pads I wear underneath the way you can with other nursing bras.
5	1357257600	Wife told me she couldn't find any nursing bras she liked... I bought her these on Amazon, and she loves them!  She was a 34 DDD, and the larger was too large... so we swapped out for mediums, and they fit great!  I just told her I was writing a review, and she told me to put that &#34;they are so good&#34;!
4	1357257600	These are my favorite nursing bras.  They are super comfortable and easy to work with.  I wish they came in different colors.  They also tend to stretch a little after wearing them.
5	1357257600	Have been using this style bra for 15 months of nursing. Love the comfort and ease of use. Worth the money!
5	1357171200	By the time I decided to order this kind of bra I didn't care as much about the look as about the overall comfort. At five months of my pregnancy I was very uncomfortable with underwire which I normally wear all the time and my breasts seemed to get larger and larger. This Bra was exactly what I needed. It looks nice and smooth under the clothing and it is very stretchy and accomadating! I bought three of these in different colors and they are all I wear. I went from a 36B to a 36C/D and I got this in a Medium which I think will also fit well while breast feeding. This was worth the price.
5	1357171200	This is the most comfy, non restriction nursing bra I own.  I'm usually a 34C or D while nursing and I bought a medium.  Fits great!
1	1357171200	I ordered 2 of these bras, one large which was much too small and one XL, the XL fit great but the breast pads were not even close to large enough so they were completely noticeable through a shirt, this bra offered zero support so I looked like a sagging grandma, I would say that unless you have perky breasts to begin with don't even order this bra. After about 30 minutes of wear the material started irritating my skin. Overall not a good bra for large heavy breasts.
5	1357084800	Was a gift for my daughter in law. She was told by many of her friends to give it a try. She loves it and plans on getting a couple more. Comfort is great!
2	1357084800	it felt like too much control, i didn't know that was possible. thick and stiff with obvious pads, the original is better
2	1356912000	I realize that for a nursing bra functionality is just as (or should be more) important as aesthetic. However, I just couldn't justify spending $40+ on a bra that looks like a training/grandma bra. I am confident there are better nursing bras out there that are both comfortable, highly functional, and attractive as well.- The only positive for me: the bra was very soft and comfortable. It seems like it would be comfortable to sleep in.- I purchased the butterscotch color so that it wouldn't show through light colored clothing, which I think contributes to the unattractiveness of the product.- The outline of the pads inside the bra show through the bra, which isn't visible in the product image. I'm worried that if I wore this bra with thinner/tighter shirts that the pads would be easily visible. I wish there was more fabric on the front of the bra so the pads wouldn't show.
2	1356912000	I have a few Bravado nursing tanks that are great around the house, so I thought I'd give them a shot for a &#34;normal&#34; bra as well. This basically fits like a sports bra--i.e. it's kind of dumpy-looking if you have a large bust--and the removable pads in the cups are a real pain to deal with. They're soft, thin, foam-like inserts that fit into a pocket in the cup and they often fold up/move around inside that pocket; lots of fiddling required to keep them smooth. Would not buy this bra again or recommend.
5	1356912000	This is a fantastic nursing bra.  It is really comfy and supportive as well.  The nursing clips are one handed once you get the bra broken in.  They are a little tight at first but after a couple of days, I had the process down and they had loosened up enough to be one-handed.  I wish I had purchased this bra while I was pregnant because it is so comfy and it stretches enough to go through a couple of sizes.
5	1356825600	Super comfy!! I was concerned about the sizing but I can certainly see how M can fit various cup sizes. I've tried on so many different nursing bras and this is by far the comfiest one.
3	1356825600	I used the sizing chart but it was too small so I had to return it. Not worth the hassle of buying another right now.
5	1356825600	I absolutely love this bra. I looked around for a while reading reviews to find the "best" nursing bra. The reviews for this bra made it the winner. So glad I did...it is the most comfortable bra I have ever worn. Pre-delivery it was comfortable and I was nervous it may be too small after my milk came in, but even growing about 3 cup sizes....it fits perfectly. Pre-delivery I was a 36C so I ordered a M. Perfect. I have now ordered more in different colors. Love it!!
4	1356652800	I love this bra! It is so comfortable. The only problem is that it leaves you with a slight case of saggy boobs.
5	1356652800	I ordered this bra for my daughter for our newly expected baby. She has had this same bra before and just loves the fit, the style and the durability. She did not want any other style bra,
1	1356566400	I read the reviews on this bra and thought for sure I would have a winner...when it arrived I was very disappointed.  The band seemed small even though I followed sizing directions and the liner for the cups showed through even with much adjusting.  The support and design reminds me of a bra I purchased from a big box store for under $20.
3	1356480000	but wrong size.  Substituting the next best does not always work...my order was for a B cup and you send the next size larger.  Thoughtful,  but absolutely no help.  It would be better to have the option of a call to direct if the substitute would be ok or if waiting is an option, for correct item later (within the same month).
5	1356480000	my wife loves it. she loves these bras. very convenient and good quality. she uses one hand to snap and nurse our baby.
4	1356393600	Great bra for the price. Nice satin trim. This feels just as comfy as the sleep cotton bras but is a bit lower cut and better for wearing with workclothes. As another poster said the pads are not perfectly smooth. However they are removable and you can replace with nursing pads if needed.
3	1356307200	Its a good bra in terms of fitting and comfort. But it is costly and also the slot to put in a breast pad is useless because then the bra fabric touches the skin and does not keep the skin dry. So I ended putting the breast pad as I would on any other bra (outside the slot).
4	1356220800	This bra is really comfortable. I purchased 3 nursing bras and this is my favourite. I was a 34B before pregnancy and I purchased a medium... I think I should have gone for large instead
5	1356220800	I love it. It is very comfortable and easy to use. The snaps hook and unhook just fine. It's so comfy I have no problems sleeping in it.
4	1356048000	I am in my third trimester and am wearing this already cause I am not fitting in my other bras anymore. It is comfortable to wear. The pads that are in it seem to bunch up and not want to lay completely flat showing a line or lump under your shirt. Once I can get those to lay flat, then it would be perfect. Obviously I have not used it for nursing yet, but it seems like it will be very easy to use.
4	1356048000	This was my third purchase of the bra. The bra gives good support and easy to wash. Good thing about this bra is that you don't have to know your exact bra size. I have no idea what my bra size is now since I am breastfeeding. I purchased the medium size bra and it fits perfectly. Also size can be easily adjustable on the back. My only problem with this bra is the removable pads. It is kind of hassle to take off and put them back after a wash. It would be better if the pads are sewn to the bra instead of removable. Overall I am pretty happy with this purchase.
5	1355788800	I am very cheap, but I had one bravado bra (the original) already and loved it.  I bought this one because it's got a traditional back closure instead of being a racerback that you have to pull over your head.  This bra is as nice, well made, supportive and comfortable as the original style.  Completely worth the cost.  Especially if you'll be wearing nursing bras exclusively for at least a year, as I do.  I'm just sorry I didn't have this bra for the previous three children!
5	1355788800	Feel like a sports bra but with looks like a regular bra. I'm currently at a very full C cup and a medium fits fine.
2	1355788800	I usually wear a size small or medium in a shirt, but the M is tight for me. The idea is nice and I can imagine it is comfortable if it fits. The time I did wear it I got a rash in the crease under my breasts. The fabric is not breathable at all.
4	1355702400	Love this bra except for removable pads. I generally hate removable pads anyways. Every time i nurse my baby the pads are always really messed up its annoying. But besides that the bra is really comfy.
2	1355702400	I'm used to bras feeling very tight. Their size chart suggested I was right in the middle of size L, so I bought the L, but it doesn't feel like a bra at all, more like a generic tube bra that happens to have nursing clips on it. I wish I'd bought a M.
5	1355702400	This is a great nursing bra. I like the softness of the fabric and that there is no underwire. The 3 clasps in the back are supportive and stay put. I ordered a second because I liked it so much.
5	1355702400	My nipples were so sore first three months of nursing. I hated wearning anything that felt scrarchy against them. The only thing that worked besides wearing shells, hydrogel pads, and lanolin was this bra. I went braless most of the time at home and just wore soft cotton, modal, or synthetic tops. But when I went out, needed more lift. I heard so much about these bras...how great they were for sore nipples plus wireless which is good for me since I got plugged ducts at times. These were so comforting for my poor nipples. I bought a second one to rotate with the first. Plus I did not even have to leave home, get fitted and all that. My guesstimate as to what my post partum size is was enough to buy a good fitting one.
5	1355529600	I loved my Bravado bra so much I got 2 more.  After trying several different styles and brands, this is the one that manages to hit all my requirements.Pros:- fits like a soft, moderate compression sports bra, full coverage at back and sides without rolling, yet low enough in the front so it does not show on low-cut shirts- wide back band with 3 hooks, and 4 tightness settings- lifts and separates- easy to unlatch, full drop panel- removable shaped liners to disguise pads and cover nips, fully liner panel so you could insert additional pads as desired- baby likes the smooth cloth and playing with the latches while nursing- includes alternative latching hook and instructions on how to install- comfortable for sleeping- variety of colors- never gives me blocked ducts!Cons- not as shaping or supportive as an underwire- requires a lot of cinching of shoulder straps to get real lift if you are a larger size, but then straps dig at shoulders- requires 2 hands to re-latch panel
4	1355529600	This bra is great for both pregnancy and nursing.  It's so comfortable and I reach for it all the time.  My only complaint is the thin nursing straps (not the bra straps) seem to fray over time, doesn't really bother me though.  The molded cups make this not "seamless" but I just remove them.  Easy to open and close.  For sizing info - pre-pregnancy I was a 34B, during pregnancy a 36C - I wore the size Med for my first 6 months postpartum and now the small fits perfect.  Plan to buy another with baby #2 on the way!
5	1355529600	I'm a nursing mother, so I was looking for the bra that provides the good level of support but not to tight. And I found it!
3	1355529600	For the price, I would expect to give it 5 stars but I can't bring myself to do it. It's middle of the road in comfort...it's almost too tight but I followed the ordering chart. If you wear even a slighly thin shirt you totally see the removable breast pads and if you remove them, well things get a bit nipply. Too bad they didn't just make it lightly lined all over the breast part. As far as ease of access for bf'ing, I have no complaints there.
2	1355443200	The bra itself is great but the the way Bravado packages it causes deep creases to form in the soft cups.  These creases show through your shirt ruining the &#34;seamless&#34; quality of the bra.  I ordered two of these bras at the same time (each from a different seller) and they both arrived with the same issue.  This leads me to believe Bravado is responsible for the issue.  Disappointed as I am usually quite pleased with their products.
5	1355443200	I'm providing a comparison in my review for those like me who had a hard time deciding which bras to pick without being able to see or try them on firsthand.  Let me start by saying that both the Body Silk and Bliss are quality bras and I like them both, but there are some big differences.Info about me:  Pre-pregnancy, I was a 38C.  I'm 9 months pregnant now, gained about 20 lbs and I'm about 40D now.  My favorite bras pre-pregnancy are Bali underwire bras (non-padded), which I also slept in on a nightly basis. Anything to keep the girls from sagging!  I purchased the Bliss (40 D/E) from Amazon and received the Body Silk (size XL) as a baby shower gift.  Here are the comparisons:-Both are very supportive, and as a bigger chested girl, I like and need that.  The Body Silk feels like a more supportive sports bra, keeping my boobs very snug and in place.  The Body Silk was a little more comfortable to sleep in than the Bliss.  One point for Body Silk!-Both bras have light padding, and I don't usually like padded bras but I know it will help hide nursing pads, etc.  The Bliss' cups are a bit cone shaped, which may look a little unnatural and fit a little odd near the nipple but I think the cups will break in as you wear the bra longer.  The Body Silk has removable pads, which were very noticeable and bumpy (not smooth at all like in the product's ad).  I removed the pads right away and put a pair of Bamboobies nursing pads in there instead.  MUCH better, barely noticeable.  I don't know why they bothered putting those removable pads in there, especially since most women will wear nursing pads in their bras, but at least you can remove them if you don't like them.  As a person who prefers un-padded bras, the Body Silk gets another point from me.-Sizing:  I think women of most sizes will prefer the Body Silk because the bra is quite snug and supportive.  The Body Silk will hug your curves whether you have small or big boobs.  However, I must mention that I am wearing the largest sized Body Silk that Bravado makes (XL and I'm 40D) and it is quite snug on me, cup and band-wise.  Any woman with a chest larger than mine will probably not be able to fit into a Body Silk or wear it comfortably.  This makes the Bliss a better bra for bigger-chested/plus-sized women who can fill out the Bliss' cups better.  Also the Bliss comes with a bra band extender, a plus for women needing more room in the band.  The Body Silk does not come with band extender.  Larger women will have to go with the Bliss or another nursing bra until Bravado starts making the Body Silk in larger sizes.-Appearance:  I like the way the Bliss keeps boobs separate, but the massive cone-shaped padded cups don't fit quite right so you may appear a bit bumpy around the nipple area from the cone shaping.  Adding nursing pads didn't help.  Some have suggested ordering a cup-size down but I know that breast size will fluctuate when you're nursing so I'm not sure if ordering a size down is wise.  The extra room is only around the nipple and larger-breasted women may fill the cup better.  Once again, I'm hoping that as I wear that bra, the cups will break in.  The Body Silk squashed my boobs together and gave a bit of a uni-boob look under my tight t-shirt.  It didn't really bother me though.Final thoughts:  Both bras are great but I prefer the Body Silk over the Bliss for now.  The Body Silk is comfortable, can be worn un-padded with just my nursing pads in place, and seems very comfortable to sleep in.  The Body Silk also seems better able to adjust to fluctuating cup-size and will probably fit just as well when I start losing the pregnancy weight.  The Bliss is a good alternative, especially for larger women, and I think as the Bliss is worn more, it will mold to your breasts and fit better.UPDATE: I just had my baby and the Bliss bra came with me to the hospital. I was able to sleep in it comfortably and the shaping of the cups have molded to me. I am now filling out the extra room in the nipple area.  With more wear, the Bliss will fit even better.  Body Silk, on the other hand, fit me snugly before giving birth but now that my breasts are engorged, the "snug" fit feels very uncomfortable.  I still like Body Silk and wish that Bravado would make them in larger sizes.
1	1355356800	I returned this after trying it on because it offered no support.  If you are large chested, try the Bravado Bliss for better support.
5	1355356800	I love these nursing bras.. I used them with my first.. They are super supportive especially with larger breasts... My only complaint is that they are not the cutest/most fashionable, but I still love them so much I give them 5 stars.. Oh! Also great quality! I have owned two.. One I wore with my first and the other I have worn with my second.. I nursed my first for 22 months.. still in good condition!
4	1355270400	There are so many seamless nursing bras, but rarely do they also offer support. This bra is incredibly comfortable, the nursing snaps are durable and don't come undone easily. The best part about this bra is that it does actually provide a decent amount of support.
5	1355184000	Love this bra!  Washes well and fits great. I've even worn it overnight and it doesn't hurt or rub or pinch. Just great!
5	1355097600	I own one in black and butterscotch. Super comfortable, has robust clasps that can be handled one-handed. Hides nursing pads.
5	1355011200	I am larger busted (pre-pregnancy 34D, during pregnancy 38D) and this bra is pretty great for me.  First and foremost, it's very comfortable, easy to click and unclick and adjustable.  It certainly does not give me the support underwire would, but I've resolved to accept slightly saggy boobs until done breastfeeding.  If I'm wearing a shirt where the sagging is particularly evident, I throw on a tank with a shelf bra under the shirt and it gives me a little more lift.  I've been wearing this bra non-stop for about 6 months and it is holding up quite well, and I put it in the washer and dryer.  If I would spring for another and lay flat to dry it would probably be holding up even better.  If you wear disposable breastpads with it, leave in the removable breast pads it comes with otherwise it's just a little bit too thin and you can see the disposable pads. I'd recommend this for any nursing mama.
5	1354924800	This nursing bra has worked out great for me.  The clips make it easy to remove and snap the bra back in place during feedings.  It is comfortable enough to wear at night as well.  I do think it is a bit pricey, but I couldn't find anything else out there that came even close to this bra.
5	1354665600	You won't need any other bra while nursing. No sleeping bra, no day time bra, just this. You can pump in it, everything. Very comfy, yet provides excellent support.
5	1354665600	I'm normally a size 16, bra size 40C/38D (plus size figure). I got this bra thinking it would be too small based on the reviews, but it's perfect, not suffocating, and carries the goods wells. I'm 22 weeks pregnant (with twins) and for now it fits me pretty well. Maybe in time it'll be suffocating and hard to wear, but right now, I'm good and hopefully after the pregnancy it'll still be perfect.
3	1354665600	This review is after approximately 7 wears.  Pre-pregnancy, I am a 34C.  Nursing postpartum, I'm a 36 C/D(ish).Pros:- Comfortable- It supports when you put it on fresh after a wash and throughout that day- No underwire digging or blocking milk ducts- the pads are very thin (discreet) and removable, if desired. After a wash, if the pads are crooked, the hole is big enough (and bra stretchy enough) to pull out the pad to straighten and reposition/reinsert- shoulder straps are great material and are adjustableCons:- the band that connects the shoulder strap to the lower part of the bra when it is unhooked is too thin and stretchy. This band should be supporting the breast (and that side of the bra) while nursing. Unfortunately, it does not do that.  My breasts are very heavy naturally and adding breast milk to this situation means support is a must.  When you are finished nursing but with an arm still under your baby, the common thing to do is use the only free hand to cross over the chest to grab the bra cup and snap it back into place. Because the band is so thin, as you pull the cup up toward the snap, the band and snap begin to ride up your shoulder. It's not easy to play catch with the opposite hand/arm.  So imagine trying to do this in a semi-public place while you pray that jr. doesn't kick your nursing cover open :-) But, realistically, my breasts are heavy so if  a) your husband bought you fakies or  b) this is the first time your boobs have been stretched to the max and they're still completely perky, you may not have this problem- when nursing and one cup is down, the lower part of the bra digs into the center of your chest, making full breaths a bit of a tasks- must be washed every day to be able to enjoy the maximum support and comfort that this bra is able to provide.Of course these cons may only apply to those of you who have always filled out a bra. I'm always on the larger side of medium EVERYTHING but never big enough to be able to fit comfortably into a large ANYTHING. My breasts could probably set up camp in a large but my waist is small so the hooks would need tighter settings.  I was silly to think that this bra would be a miracle and different from the rest. The pictures and models fool me every time :-)
4	1354665600	I wish it had more lift and shaped a bit better, but I guess none of that matters too much, because once I put it on in the morning, I forget about it all day. I think that is a sign it is working just fine, because annoying bras can't be forgotten.
4	1354579200	I didn't nurse for long, so, I can't speak to the durability after many uses - but for the short time I was rocking this bra, I loved it. Very comfortable (stretches in every direction) but also has a nice light control/hold from the spandex so I actually felt supported. A blessing for sore breasts. I kind of wish I could get away with digging it out of my maternity box to keep wearing.
5	1354579200	Pros:- Comfortable- Supportive (no sagging for DDD cup)Cons:- Bra sometime shows when wearing with low scoop neck topsBottom Line: Worth every penny for the comfort and support. I wish I didn't waste my money with the Motherhood nursing bras before finding out about this bra!
5	1354492800	I wear this one that I bought in ivory and another that I bought in turquoise every single day. They are nice for sleeping in as well as during the day. Good support! I couldn't wear anything else since I am pregnant and seem to not stop growing. Currently a 36D. Keeps everything high and separated which is most important. I wish I had more. Definitely worth the pricey tag for me!
4	1354233600	I like this product, it washes well and is easy to use. It almost seems to run a little large, maybe get a size smaller if you are on the edge between two sizes.
1	1354060800	In 2009 I had my daughter and used this bra exclusively - LOVED it! Ordered 2 more to use while nursing my newest (born in Aug 2012) and they are not the same!  YUK!  The cut is different, the material is different - it's not the same soft, thick, stretchy material.  Instead, the material feels flimsier and is totally different than the bras I had in 2009.  I am so disappointed as this bra (the 2009 model) fit great and worked wonderfully.  Back to the drawing board. :((Notice that many of the positive reviews are several year old.)
5	1354060800	After trying several nursing bras, I am most pleased with this one. It's comfortable (which is not easy to find with my large chest!), flattering and supportive. I haven't started nursing yet (I am 7 and a half months pregnant), but from what I can tell it will transition well to that. The bra is designed to comfortably fit up to 3 cup sizes, so I know it will work when my milk comes in too. It's more like a sports bra than a under-wire, but even with my large chest, it hasn't been a problem, but if you want a huge "lift" this may not be what you are after...I wanted comfort and support, which this bra provides.
4	1353801600	I think it's worth it to spend a little more on a good nursing bra and I would say this one is worth the price. It is very comfortable and works well when nursing. I bought a few nursing bras from Pea in a Pod for about the same price and I think those give a slightly smoother look under clothing but this bra is a very close second! I don't regret the purchase at all. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. I'm a 34C.
5	1353628800	I recently purchased three nursing bras off of Amazon and this is by far the most comfortable!  I can see why it has such high ratings.  In addition to this bra, I ordered the Anita Maternity Women's Microfiber Nursing Bra #5068 as well as the Hot Milk Women's Luminous Bra.  I ordered all three based off of customer ratings.  I am not yet nursing so I cannot comment on its ease of use, but as far as comfort goes I give it 5 stars.
5	1353628800	I'm a 38DD (E) and nursing my second child. I've bought lots of cheaper nursing bras, and after having an underwire ride on my ribs all afternoon, I finally threw in the towel and decided to make my money count. I ordered this bra after lots of review reading on various brands. It's. Wonderful. It's crazy supportive, wonderfully comfortable, and amazingly discrete. AND you can convert it to a regular bra when you're done nursing. HELLO!!!! How wonderful is that?!?! I seriously believe I could live in this bra day and night. The clips are fine...they're aren't the simple ones like Target's bras, but they don't require two hands, either...they just take a little getting used to. For the support the bra offers, I can work with it. This one is definitely worth the money.
4	1353542400	This bra is comfortable and does the job. My only complaint is that over time the support strap has stretched out a bit.
4	1353456000	Might just be me, but if you're between sizes, I'd recommend ordering a size up.  I'm still pregnant (8 months with twins, but haven't over-gained weight) and ordered the smaller size (large).  Am returning for the x-large because the large was already pretty tight.
5	1353283200	I've tried several nursing bras/tops and this has been the best by far!  I was always hesitant to spend a little extra on a nursing bra but definitely worth every penny.  I wish I would've found this bra sooner.
1	1353110400	Based on a friend's recommendation, I purchased this bra after having my first child. After 2 washes, both time hand washed, seams near the bra hook came undone. I contacted Bravado's customer service but received no reply after a month (!!). I do not recommend this bra and would caution anyone to also beware of their terrible customer service. For the price I paid, the quality is worse than a $15 bras at Target. Huge disappointment
5	1352937600	This bra is great! With the padded cups in it is great to wear in public (covers the silhouette of nursing pads, etc.), and without the cups in it is really comfortable to sleep in (is also comfortable with them, just more so...). The only issue I could see is if this were worn in the hot summer months it might be less comfortable, since its not cotton and sweat would just stay with you. This bra is well worth the money and fits well!
5	1352851200	I've loved Bravado bras since I was nursing my oldest (who is now almost 6).  I never got to try this style, but I went for it this time while I needed a good maternity bra that would carry over to nursing.  This bra is extremely comfortable, supportive, and has good coverage.  As with all of the products I've tried from Bravado, I definitely recommend this product, in any color.
2	1352764800	This is not an item you can buy online.  The sizing is by small, medium, large, etc.  However, based on their packaging, a 36B is a small and is definitely too small.  I had to return it.
5	1352678400	I love this bra! I'm very chesty, and even more so while breastfeeding. I have always needed an underwire, but find that this bra offers enough support without needing the wire, which is so much more comfortable! It is really great quality, and worth the money. I originally bought the nude color, and then bought the plum which is fun!
5	1352505600	After buying close to 20 different nursing bras and still being uncomfortable, i came across the Bravado bra.  Wearing it for the first time gave me such a feeling of relief (from engorgement).  the fabric was gentle enough against sore/raw nipples and the foam cups provided aided against nipple show-thru and leaks.  I loved it so much that i bought 3 more.  It still fits well even if my breast size has already gone down a bit (owing to my milk supply being established).  I can imagine wearing this even after nursing.
5	1352419200	I bought a few bras that were half the price and sure enough they are half as good. This is the best bra I have used yet! I want one in every color if I could.
5	1352073600	I've been looking for this bra my whole pregnancy! I went through a bunch looking for a comfortable bra I can wear in public. This is it! Finally 5 months in and I found it! And it can be used for nursing.....perfect!Great for small girls with large cup size! ;)
5	1351900800	It's my first nursing bra and I got it in the last month of my pregnancy. It's very very comfortable and fits me perfectly, quite easy to use for breastfeeding. So I got a second one of it (just a different color). I don't think it necessary for me to try some other brands! I love it!! It's a wonderful choice for nursing my little angel!
5	1351814400	Love the light padding and great fit of this bra! Highly recommend! Kind of pricey...but well worth the investment!  You will want to buy 2!
5	1351728000	I tried many nursing bras and this is the only one I wear now (six months in). I even bought it in other colors.  Sizing is right on as well.
1	1351641600	With or without the extra padding it makes your boobs look very lumpy.  I was unable to wear it under t-shirts since it looked like I was stuffing my bra with socks/tissues.  The lumpiness is exacerbated with nursing pads.  I didn't even like to wear it under baggier clothes such as hoodies because it had so much fabric around the band making it uncomfortable.  I bought it and wore it twice.
5	1351296000	I wish I would have found these sooner. They're a little pricey but well worth the money. I spent too much on other less comfortable bras, I got rid of those and am now only using the Bravado bra. Great product!!
5	1351209600	I bought this bra for wearing around the house and at night for support. It is so extremely comfortable and the fabric is very soft against my tender breasts as my milk just came in. It provides good support for heavy breasts but doesn't squeeze or constrict them while I sleep. It is also very pretty! True to size as well. I'm a 38D and got a large. It's perfect.
5	1350950400	Hi I just want to say i'm in love with this bra! Im a small person with big boobs and now that I'm breastfeeding I'm bigger! I was looking for something cool that doesnt make me look like a 50 years old grandma and I found it.I was hesitating to buy because of the price but now that im wearing it, i know i made the right choice and as i plan to breastfeed for another 6 more months for sure I will buy another one.Just to let you im normally 34D so I ordered size M and it is ok.
5	1350691200	Very comfortable! Made of stretchy sports bra material. Works as a maternity bra, then a nursing bra, THEN a regular bra! (Conversion Kit is included to replace nursing clips with regular clips.) Straps are adjustable from the FRONT!I am in my 3rd month of nursing and wearing size 34I/J. I ordered a Large and it fits great.From the package: Fabric is 90% nylon, 10% spandex. Removable Foam Inserts are 100% polyester, 100% polyurethane.I have uploaded two images. One of the package sizing chart, and one of the conversion "kit" included with the bra. I hope these help to make your decision.
3	1350518400	This bra is excellent, I really love it and it's exactly what I wanted. However, it did not arrive until 5 days after the delivery window I was given, which was frustrating since it's really not that much cheaper than it was in a local maternity store, and the last thing I wanted was to be left waiting for a nursing bra in case my baby decided to show up early!
4	1350345600	I was really hoping to find a nursing bra that was comfortable, nice looking, and can be worn under regular clothes...I don't think that exists, so I settled for the Bravado nursing bra. As far as comfort and convenience is concerned I give this bra 5 stars. I hate sleeping in bras but I had no problem sleeping in this one. It's soft, super comfy, and fits really well. I was a 36c pre baby and have gone to a D cup when nursing. The medium fit perfectly. My major gripe with this bra is that it shows under my clothes in the front because it comes up so high (I swear they are normal shirts and not super low cut!). Also, the nursing pads have to be worn in order to avoid having your nipples show through, which isn't so bad, but the outline of the pads shows under shirts and sometimes they wrinkle up when I fold them down to nurse. Overall I think this is a really great bra. I would recommend it to all of my preggo friends.
5	1350259200	I have never written a review for any other product but this bra exceeded my expectations. I have always worn underwire bras for that extra support, so naturally my first maternity bra also had underwire but it was extremely uncomfortable and I believe resulted in a breast infection. I purchased this bra after reading the reviews and absolutely love it. I wear a Large and I find that this bra offers the support I need and want but is also light and comfortable. The range of available colors is also a bonus. Would recommend to other mothers who are a C or D cup.
3	1350086400	I was always a 32 B pre-pregnancy so the obvious choice was to buy a "small" size. But now that im pregnant, i have gone up to 36 B/C (still a small according to their chart) but the bra was rather uncomfortable and tight. If you ladies like a snug fit, then go for a real size, otherwise if you like some room then go up a size to be safe. Quality was satisfactory.
2	1349913600	I must say that this bra is comfortable, and does give you support. I am a 36D. I was surprised at the amount of support without an under wire and would have kept this bra if it weren't for the removable pads. I need the extra layer of fabric in order to hide my mommy nipples and/or nursing pads, but the removable pads are horrid. They are 4-5in circles and leave very noticeable imprints on my boobs. It looks like headlights. If they were permanent and covered the entire bra than this bra would have been perfect. But as is I would not wear it out in public unless I was wearing a jacket or something to cover up. If you don't care about your nipples showing or the imprints then I would suggest trying this bra out, otherwise, don't waist your time or money. Amazon was perfect though and I was able to return it hassle free and didn't get charged for shipping.
5	1349913600	This bra is super comfortable and gives enough support without digging into my shoulders or ribcage. Also, it's soft so baby's face doesn't get hindered if rubbed up on it.  I like this bra very much. No uncomfortable wire to contend with.  It gives a nice shape-and doesn't let nipples show at all.  Easy to change the pads. Washes with regular wash and holds up very well.  I've tried several nursing bras and nothing comes even close.  This is the best bra I've ever owned. After trying one for six months, I ended up buying a few more in different colors and wishing I never wasted money any others brands. It's well worth the price.  They come with conversion clips and after I'm done nursing, I will convert it and wear as regular bra.
5	1349827200	This is by far the most comfortable and best fitting nursing bra I have purchased.  I think it is worth the money.  The material is stretchy enough that it doesn't look matronly under shirts like many other nursing bras, but it's well built so it's still supportive.  Closest thing to a "real" bra that I have found.
4	1349827200	This bra is comfortable and fits well.  Very functional.  It's not the most flattering item on the planet (pretty sports bra-ish) but, definitely wearable.
5	1349740800	I had been looking around for a while for a bra that would be supportive enough for my larger breast but wouldn't break the bank in terms of cost. The Bravado bras fit the bill.
5	1349654400	I ordered size M for 36D bra size and it works great. The material made it very comfortable when my breast is full or empty. It is quite expensive, but you get what you pay for. I have a whole bunch of cheaper ones, but they were not as comfy. Some of them caused clogged duct because they were too tight when my breast was full.
4	1349481600	This bra is nice and supportive despite having no underwire. It is very comfortable and I like the removable pad to help give breasts a nice smooth look under clothes. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the sizing runs a bit small. I purchased based on the sizing printed on the package, but I probably would have been even more comfortable in the next size up. Overall I would definitely recommend this product as it is a great affordable, comfortable, and supportive bra for pregnancy and nursing.
4	1349308800	This bra is everything it claims to be.  No wires to dig into your skin, but still good support.  Very comfortable.  Looks good under clothing.  It does not make you look like you are wearing a sports bra, which is what most non wired bras do.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
5	1348963200	Yeah it's a little expensive. It is totally worth it. Skip buying other bras. Just go for this one. Removable cups are a bit annoying but are certainly necessary.
5	1348876800	Very comfortable bra and easy to use while nursing! It is pricey for a bra that doesn't look like much, but is functional.
5	1348790400	These bras are great!!! I ordered one before I gave birth so I would be prepared. I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was. I didn't wear bras often pre-pregnancy as I found them bothersome -- So the fact that I don't mind it at all, is a big deal. Now 2 weeks after birth I have ordered an additional 2, (a size larger as the girls have grown!) and can't imagine my daily routine without them. They really are fabulous. I am around a 44 C/D and the XL size suits me perfectly. A must have for any nursing mom!
2	1348790400	Biggest issue, is this bra holds your breasts together which allows for no circulation. So after about a month of wearing it, I noticed a rash starting between my breasts. A yeast infection! Eek! Changing to a bra that holds each breast separately, instead of smooshed together, solved the problem. I recommend Anita nursing bras, they don't give you the rash or the unattractive uniboob look.
5	1348704000	AMAZING!..I was a little nervous because the price seemed a bit high, but I have no complaints now. I bought two other nursing bras from walmart, one for day and one w/light support for night, however this bra is better then the other bra for day and even though I am at the end of my pregnancy I am already wearing this bra every day!. Its comfortable, supportive and attractive. I purchased mine in black with winter approaching. I am currently a size 38 C and ordered a size M which fits perfectly. it come with padding that you can take out, but i like it for the extra support and look.
5	1348617600	I've had my Bravado nursing bra for about 2 weeks. I've barely taken it off! It's comfortable enough to sleep in, but supportive enough to wear in public. I'm nursing my second child right now, and I've finally found a bra that I like. I like that each size fits a range of bra sizes, for the ever-fluctuating postpartum breastfeeding body. I think I'm a 34 C right now, and I ordered a medium. It fits well on the tightest setting.It is not going to give the same shape as an underwire bra, but I'm ok with that because it's actually comfortable!
5	1348617600	I am a 34 H And this bra is the only one I've found to be supportive enough and comfortable would definitely recommend to a friend !
1	1348617600	Very thin and the removable pads show right through the fabric.  Too bad because the fabric is soft and seemed like it would have been comfortable.  Sending it back.
3	1348531200	So after reading the countless reviews I ordered this bra to accommodate my rapidly expanding cup size. I was a size 36D before pregnancy and ordered for myself estimating that I was approximately a 36DDD in size at that time. The size large fit nicely, however as many other reviewers have noted the pad inserts inside the bra are smaller than the actual cup size itself, which means they bunch up easily and can show through tighter fitting tops. You can easily remove them, but the bra itself is not thick enough to hide your nipples. I have found that my breasts as they have grown have become very heavy and this bra does not provide adequate "push up effect", so I would recommend a bra with an underwire for other large cup size women for those that desire a bra that lifts. All in all I will be using this bra through the weekends and at home for comfort, but definitely NOT for an special occasions.
5	1348358400	I bought many different kinds of nursing bras, and this one is by far my favorite.  It is the most comfortable, and it is easy to insert nursing pads (some of the other bras I have didn't work well with nursing pads).  I'm normally a 34C and with nursing my newborn I'm a 36D and the medium is a good fit for me.  I will be ordering more in different colors - it is so easy and comfortable to wear!
5	1348358400	I'm a big fan of this bra. I'm having a hard time knowing what size to get because most people recommend going up one cup size, but I needed to go up 2. [B -> D] The Medium size of this bra is very, very comfortable. More so than any other that I've tried. I can sleep in it. I also like the way the front of the bra is one panel and that it comes with pads that slide into the fabric of the cups... these aren't nursing pads, but give you a bit more protection from leaking through your nursing pads or from having your nursing pad lines be visible through your shirt.Want one of these for post-nursing days too! It's that comfortable while being supportive.
4	1348185600	According to the package sizing, I am a 42D, but when I got it, it was a little tight in the cup size, and since you go up a cup size when you breastfeed, I should have gotten a 42DD(E) which is the next cup size up. I recommend getting 1 cup size large than you measure. Other than that it is comfortable, but overpriced in my opinion. I probably wouldn't buy it again because the price is higher than I think it's worth.
3	1347580800	I really don't understand what all the fuss is about this bra. Sure, it works fine, but it's nothing spectacular. It's functional and reasonably comfortable, and I wear it often, but I certainly wouldn't rave about it. I followed the size guidelines and ended up with a band that's a smidge too tight, and cups that are a little bit too loose. The removable pads are kind of a pain, as I always have to fiddle with them to get them to sit flat enough to not show through my shirt. The bra is unflattering without the pads, so why isn't the padding just sewn in? It is easy to unhook the cups with one hand, but it can get difficult to re-hook them with one hand because there's just one extremely stretchy piece of elastic left holding the strap in place, and the hook part is often way up over my shoulder when it comes time to reattach. Also, I find the cup a little bit awkward to keep tucked out of the way when feeding the baby. All in all, I'm not upset that I own this item, but I certainly wouldn't pay full price for one again, and I'd think twice before buying it at even half off.
5	1347494400	As nerve-wracking as it can be searching for a great nursing bra online, when the Bravado! seamless nursing bra arrived I gave a sigh of relief--literally. Prior to receiving this bra, I had been wearing a less-than-flattering and fairly uncomfortable nursing bra that gave me a uni-boob (really, as if excess weight gain and swollen breasts isn't enough!) and when the nursing panels were down it had too much excess material at the sides of the breasts that bind and inhibit milk flow. Not so with this bra. I can wear it and it gives my breasts shape and support, as well as the comfort of a soft cup. There is no excess material at the sides of the breasts when the panels are down, just a simple thin strap to help hold the bra on while you nurse. I was concerned that sizing would be an issue, giving my breasts have changed from a 34C/36B to a 38B/C...medium fits great, and the nylon/spandex blend adjusts to my changing breast size. Don't hesitate to give this bra a try. Copy and paste this link to your web browser, and it will display the Bravado! sizing image: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41tm8CJ%2BT0L.jpg
1	1347494400	If you have anything larger than C-cup breasts, go with the other Bravado nursing bra (honestly, even C-cup wearers may not find this comfortable or flattering).  The Bodysilk Seamless is horrible.  I was a natural 36DD before pregnancy, then went up to a 38DD by the time I needed a nursing bra.  Not only was this completely see-through (not that that's too big a deal), I didn't feel supported at all.  It was too tight in all the wrong places (even though I bought the size it said I needed), and really, it wasn't comfortable.  Even though the other Bravado bra gives the wearer the pointy-boob look it's not so bad in clothes, and it's also much more supportive, AND has some more lining in the cups.  Much better all around.
4	1347321600	Very useful I would recommended for all the mom soon to be every one should get one and even after birth
5	1347321600	I bought this for my wife.  Here are her comments:"This is a very comfortable bra (more than any other) and it's easy to wash.  I would highly recommend this bra for nursing mothers."
4	1346976000	I wore a 32DD before pregnancy and it's been very difficult to find bras that fit me well now that I'm up to a 32 f/g. This bra is great. Just remember that if you're on the cusp of a size, order a size smaller. I should be a medium on their chart, but I had to return a medium for a small.
5	1346198400	This bra is perfect! I nursed my first baby for 15 months. Now I'm nursing my second and my search for the perfect nursing bra has finally come to an end.  This bra is supportive and comfortable - I can (and do) wear it all day without complaint.  It is also flattering (as flattering as a nursing bra can be) and because it is not racer-back style, it can be worn with almost any shirt or dress. It also allows full access for nursing, which is important for me.  I have a larger bust so finding a bra that fulfills all of these requirements has been such a challenge.  I'm so glad that I found this bra - I'm going to buy a few more!
5	1346112000	I never seem to get it right with bras in general and nursing bras are no exception. I love the Bravado Seamless Nursing Bra because it does exactly what it is supposed to without looking like something my mother would wear! I was on the lookout for a bra that provided adequate support while sleeping as well. I tried sleep bras but always woke up with a soaked shirt since the bra shifted and the nursing pads didn't stay where they were supposed to. I bought the medium size and found they worked just fine.
1	1346025600	I was so excited, because the reviews were so good. Yes, this is comfortable...probably would be the most comfortable sleeping nurse bra, but for ladies with a large chest (I'm a 36 E), it looks like I have one giant boob. There is nothing in the middle to create any separation. It's also not very supportive for heavy breasts. I will say it's extremely comforable, so if you have really small boobs, or your boobs stay separated, perky and high on their own, this will work for you ;) I'll be returning this. Had it been cheaper, I would have kept it for a sleeping nurse bra.
4	1345593600	The only problem is the size guide, i followed the size guide and it turns out too small for me.
5	1345420800	Sizing is true. Washes and dries well. I removed the inserts while at home. I wash these after each day and they are holding up well.
3	1345420800	it's very comfortable ,after  wash it the stripes are very lose.You can NOT wear them out -look like grandma. so every time I go out have to change real bra.
5	1345161600	I really like this nursing bra.  It is supportive and comfortable.  I have bought 2 of these and used them for over a year.
5	1344988800	I choosed the wrong size when buying this item, pls kindly help to change the Size Middle to Large .
5	1344729600	This bra doesn't pinch, is soft and holds bigger breasts in place. The removable inserts are great. You can also put cool packs into the pockets. And after nursing is over, the bra is still great to wear.
5	1344729600	This bra is GREAT! I ordered so many others that were too tight around.  I am large chested but small around. I was a 32 DD prior to pregnancy.  This bra is comfortable and looks great under regular clothes
3	1344643200	this bra was recommended to me by the hospital staff, and i went ahead and bought it since i am too tired to shop around for bras right now. The lactation consultants at my hospital says that we should not wear under wire bras after 36 weeks. I am 37 weeks pregnant so I haven't even started breast feeding yet.. my size is 34DD-E and I have tried multiple bras since I really want a good supportive bra. This one is ok, not as supportive as my underwire bras but pretty comfortable. Still looking for the perfect nursing bra! Oh, I bought size M.
5	1344384000	I'm six months into nursing and have been alternating a super-expensive professionally-fitted boutique nursing bra with unstructured nursing bras from that big box department store with the really colorful commercials.  I finally got tired of going around with too little support and ordered this bra from amazon and couldn't be happier. No seams mean sensitive spots stay comfortable, perfect balance between support and ease, and really very handsome for a nursing bra.  If in doubt about sizing, go one size larger -- although the package measurements would have put me at a L, I ordered an XL and it fits perfectly.  I agree with the product description -- this would make the absolute most useful and treasured shower gift! Skip the newborn clothes that won't get worn before the baby outgrows them and buy this bra instead!
5	1344384000	This is my favorite nursing bra ever. It is extremely comfortable and supportive. I used the size chart and ordered according to what it said. The cups fold all the way down for easy pumping. The removable pads have not shown through any shirt I've worn, yet. I would highly recommend this bra. It fits exactly as pictured, although whose stomach looks like that if they are nursing?
5	1344211200	This bra is expensive, but worth the money.  I bought one two months ago and quickly bought another one to have in rotation.  They hide nursing pads very well, and the removable cup will protect from any leaking.  I did not have any problems with the cups looking lumpy or wrinkled once they are situated in the bra.  The only slightly annoying thing is it takes a minute or two to get the pad situated in the bra and they come out easily in the laundry.  Also, this bra is super comfortable and I know I will wear it as a regular bra in the future since I don't wear underwire usually anyway.
1	1343865600	Did I get a defective bra? I don't see how this bra received so many good reviews.The removable cup is awful. The shape of it shows through shirts so easily. When I removed the cup, it left a space that would only fit Madonna's cone boobs circa the 80's. I can't forget that the cups are see through without the cup.The only pro is that the bra really is soft. I really wanted to like it but back it goes
5	1343779200	I can't believe I wore stupid motherhood maternity nursing bra's when there are bra's like this to be had and at a great price no less.  This is like a treat for your tatas!  I got the first bra as a gift in black and I promptly bought another in nude.  In fact I might even purchase another it IS that comfortable.  The best part other than how comfortable it is and soft is that when your done you can make it into a regular bra.  Why wear sports bra's when you can have the best of both worlds in this bra.  Such a great product.  I recommend it to all my nursing friends.  In fact i might just start giving this as a gift and change someone else life the way this product did mine. Happy to have found Bravado! Bravo!
5	1343520000	I love this nursing bra.  I hesitated to buy it t first because of the price.  I actually found that Target carries the Bravado Basics line and I picked up a couple of bras there.  But I had a gift certificate to a maternity store and used it on one of these and it has become by far, my favorite bra.  It is super comfortable and fits great.  And even after using for 6+ months, it has held up well.  I kind of wish I had just bought a few of these in the first place!  Highly recommended.
1	1343260800	I too, hated this bra! Not worthy at all of the high ratings on Amazon...which are usually spot-on. Not in this case, the bra was uncomfortable but the worst part is, like another reviewer put it, it makes your chest look like an 80-year old! NO SHAPE, NO SUPPORT. I looked worse with it on than off! I am a full C-cup but wore a "D" throughout pregnancy and nursing. If you want a good nursing bra, I recommend the Anita brand instead.
3	1343088000	I bought this one as well as the Medela seamless nursing bra and prefer the Medela.  This one is kind of grandma-ish, with thick fabric and a really high middle section so it doesn't work with most of my tanktops and lower cut shirts.  Maybe this one is necessary for a more busty girl but for me the thinner, lighter Medela bras are better.
5	1343088000	Great bra; true to size and fits perfectly. Only complaint is that 4 months in the padded inserts have started to wrinkle and I have to straighten them out every time I put the bra on. Also after being washed several times the bra has started to snag and look old. Granted no one every sees it, so that doesn't really matter! This bra is a great choice for any nursing mom and an even better price.
4	1343088000	I am impressed with the quality of fabric and overall structure. Normally I wear a 36DD and was concerned the XL would be too large. But being pregnant for the 4th time know how much I will grow, so I think this will be a perfect fit when baby comes. I bought this bra for comfort, support, breathable in hot weather and color. And all of which I am very happy with. the nursing straps sometimes slip out of the sides when wearing, but I think its because its slightly too big until I actually start nursing. Even with the slightly too big size right now it seems to support pretty good.
5	1343088000	This nursing bra is very supportive and comfortable. I purchased it in Poppy, and I love the color. It's a classic, bright red (the image swatch of Poppy is a little too pinky, on my computer anyway). The hooks are easy to use with one hand. The fabric is stretchy but hasn't over-stretched even after several washings.
5	1342828800	After looking for 5 weeks at local stores for a nursing bra that fit, i finally looked to the internet and I'm so glad I did! This bra is so comfortable and fits perfectly. I ordered the medium for 34 DD bra size. This bra doesnt have underwire so you can wear it for a night time bra which is nice and it also comes with a conversion set so you can convert it to a normal bra when you are done breastfeeding. I would definitely recommend this bra for any woman who is thin, but has larger breasts while nursing.
5	1342828800	I live in an area that really does not have good selections for pregnant and nursing women. I have a few nursing tops and bras that I've found in stores that work but just aren't comfortable enough or work well with my clothes. So I went hunting online to see if I could find something. This bra is amazing! Right when I got it I tried it on and it was such a relief right from the get go! It's very supportive, the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't itch, bunch, or irritate my skin. I have really dry skin and some bras leave rashes on the sides and this one doesn't at all, even in 90 degree heat! The pads on the inside do slide around a little, but are no where near as irritating as nursing pads. The detachable clips are stiff, but much better than the other bras I have. It's by far my favorite and definitely worth the money! I will be buying more in the future. Just so you know, I am a 38D and the packaging says I should have a medium but I got a large and it fits perfect. I'd say if you're riding the line, go up a size. It's worth it for the comfort.
5	1342569600	This bra is a great fit. Comfortable like a sports bra but looks a lot nicer than one. I wear a 36C and a medium size fit perfect. I had borrowed this exact bra from a friend and loved it so much I had to buy my own. I totally recommend it.
4	1342224000	Perfect bra.  Soft and comfortable. Staps are wide enough to prevent the dreaded back fat.  I've bought a more expensive nursing bra and regret it after wearing this bra.
5	1341792000	This is the best bra I've found for nursing. The underwire nursing bras gave me mastitis. This one is very comfortable. It's the only kind I have that I wear all the time!
5	1341619200	It was important that I find a nursing bra that supported me, was comfortable, and without underwire (to avoid clogged ducts). This fits the bill well. Yes, my underwire nursing bra makes "the girls" look better but for everyday use this supports my size 36D better than the cheaper bras I tried first. I haven't encountered problems with the foam inserts like others have written about, and it's easy to unclip with one hand. I'll be ordering more!
1	1341446400	I am very disappointed in this bra. Not worth the price at all.The material is synthetic and not at all breathable. The foam pads inside the bra that give it the seamless look, actually move around and are removable. Problem is, when I unsnap one cup and bring it down for nursing, the foam pad contorts inside the cup, and when I wear it again, is folded and misshapen, and not very easy to adjust in public.Please read the negative reviews before purchasing, and please try to order it from a store like target where you can return it without shipping costs.
2	1340928000	Nice product except it ran small for me (both in the band and the cup). I am a 38 D and according to their sizing chart, medium should have worked fine but it was tight in the band and the cup. Also, like some other reviewers stated, the polyurethane pads do create an obvious rigid border underneath your clothes.
5	1340841600	I love this thing!  I ordered two more because I love it so much.  It's comfortable, it provides GREAT support for a large-chested woman (I'm a 36DD while nursing) without uncomfortable underwire.  I even occasionally sleep in this.  I just LOVE it.
5	1340582400	These are truely comfortable to wear everyday everytime. I am a new mom and I first bought 2 and now I own 4. The bra is like a sports bra so it is very comfortable but unlike a sports bra you have the comfort and ease of putting it on like a regular bra. It does not dig into you skin like a regular bra and does not shift around. I am a size 34 B and while breastfeeding I think I am a size 36 B-C. It does have some flex and can be forgiving. At first, the bottom seems a bit tight on my rib cage but with constant wear, I think I stretched it even after washing. Actually, after washing I think it feels more comfortable. I bought a variety of colors so that when I wear it under my clothes, it does not feel like I am showing my bra to the world and since many people wear sports bra in public, it doesn't feel like I am an exhibitionist (not that I do wear it without clothes over it.) It is on the expensive side but let's say it is better for the value than a Victoria's Secret bra. (And the material is thick so if you do drip while breastfeeding or leak, there will not be stains on your clothes.)
4	1340409600	I purchased two of these nursing bras, size medium (I'm currently a size 34 D). They are of much better quality and are more supportive than any nursing bra I have purchased from "a mid-priced maternity store" at the mall.  The only negative thing I would say about this bra is that it isn't exactly as it is pictured in the product photo, that is, it isn't totally smooth.  The inserts have a definite outline, and when the inserts are removed of course the bra doesn't look smooth at all.  This hasn't been a problem for me since I wear looser shirts, but if you wear fitted tops, it might bother you.
1	1340323200	I had to send this back.  I think it's uncomfortable and the material is AWFUL.  Given the cost and the good reviews on Amazon, I had high expectations and this did not come close to delivering.
5	1340064000	After my second daughter was born, I ended up a cup size and needed to purchase new nursing bras. After buying the Bravado, I swear my girls issued a sigh of relief. Not only was this bra very comfortable, but it has a nice shape and with the removable inserts, my nursing pads were hidden from view. I loved this bra so much, I immediately bought a second and all was right with the world, until my beloved bra went MIA in the wash. I tried to go without it, since I probably only have another 6 months of nursing left, but after a couple days of angry boobies, I ordered a replacement. Side note, whoever invented underwire for a nursing bra, needs to be flogged with one.  I'm a 36 DD and the Medium fits great. After almost a year it will stretch though and I have my original ones on almost the smallest hook and loop closure, so keep that in mind if you are between sizes, these do eventually stretch.Update: The new bra that I received even included a nursing bra conversion kit, so I can change this to a non nursing bra! This is genius!
5	1340064000	So after you give birth you must be prepared to wear a bra 24-hours a day.  I felt totally comfortable sleeping in this bra.  Plus it shapes nicely and has enough support that I can also wear it to work too.  This was a good buy.  Definitely worth the money!!
5	1339891200	I have a few requirements for a nursing bra:-Easy access-high quality plastic hooks-looks good under clothing-comfortable all dayThis bra has it all.  Finally!
5	1339459200	I LOVE this bra!  I have tried at least six other brands, and this is by FAR the best!  My boob would fall out of the others or they would just be uncomfortable.  This bra stays put and is SO comfy!  I would totally wear this even if I wasn't nursing!  I have 4 total and I wish I had ten!
4	1339459200	During my pregnancy, my already-large bust exploded and I was pretty uncomfortable (not to mention lumpy) in my normal bras. After doing some research about nursing bras for the full-figured I ordered these.  They are really comfortable and smooth any back fat.  Sometimes I wish they were more supportive but I'm sure I'll appreciate the current design more once I start nursing.
2	1339372800	I chose this bra because I was not sure what cup size I will need until my milk is established, as I have not given birth yet. I currently wear about an F cup bra in my third trimester of pregnancy so I purchased the XL for something to wear now as well as after I have my baby. The bra comes with removable pads which is great for extra coverage or to help hide nursing pads, but they are greatly misshapen, not sure if I wash them if they would come out smoother. The bra fits like a moderate support sports bra. The picture is very deceiving, you will not get that much lift from this bra. It is very comfortable and has a bit of growing room, but like I said it is much like a sports bra. After reading many of the reviews on this bra I figured it would be a good purchase for me, but after trying it I think I should have saved my money and just kept wearing my sports bras until I can get fitted for actual nursing bras. In my opinion, ladies who are larger breasted will not find this bra very useful, just buy yourself a few sports bras or regular bras without underwire.
5	1339286400	Love the fabric!!! Easy to snap on and off. And whether your breastfeeding already or not, this bra feels great!
4	1339113600	I find this bra very comfortable.  I love that the straps stay put on my shoulders and that there is great support without an underwire.  I do wish the foam inserts were not removable.  Without them, my nursing pads show, so I have to keep them in all the time.  The foam inserts don't fill the whole cup, move around eventually, and the edges are visible through some shirts.  Overall I am happy with this product, but I have yet to find the perfect nursing bra.
5	1338854400	I love this bra! It's super comfortable but also provides great support (I'm an E while I'm nursing). I bought it after my first child was born and I just ordered two more for nursing my second child. I was wearing the bra during the last few months of pregnancy and I now wear it at night as well as during the day and it doesn't bother me at all at night.The sizing seems odd but a medium works great for me (I'm a 34). I wore the bra throughout the nursing period, including when I reduced & finally stopped nursing, so it worked well for several cup sizes (from an E down to a C).I do have more supportive bras for exercising and I wouldn't use this one for jogging but it's a great everyday bra.
5	1338854400	I am currently 9 months pregnant with my second child.  All my old nursing bras from before are well used and stretched out.  I decided to give this one a try.  I love it!  Very, very comfortable with good support.  I am a 34 DD and ordered the M, it fits well and has some room.  I am currently wearing it now b/c all my underwire bras are digging into my large belly.  I am back to buy more.  If your looking for comfort in a nursing bra this is the one for you.  I have tried many with my first child and none compare.
5	1338508800	my wife love it so much.Comparing with Other similar product, it is more comfortable.She love it more until she tried other product.
3	1338422400	I really, really wanted to like this nursing bra. Having just had my 3rd baby I'm over annoying nursing bras! I read a lot of the already given reviews on this and other bras and decided to get this one. However, when I tried it on there was major sagging in the cups--under my bust, and the removable pads were super lumpy.  My baby is 3 weeks old and I measure 29 band and 36 bust, so I ordered a S, knowing that I'll get smaller as time goes on. I decided to return it because of the bagginess of the cup. Also, the removable pads didn't lie flush with the bra, they looked like major stuffing! But maybe that part would smooth out with wear! Either way, the cups didn't fit me!
4	1338422400	I have had at least 3 or 4 of these bras over the years and have loved them so much I never converted back even after I stopped nursing. They are seriously the most comfortable bra I have ever owned, nursing or not. I ordered the soft pink one this time and the color is lovely, however, it seems that the material in the cup is extra baggy for some reason on this particular bra. Since I use the padded cup which fills out the bra on its own for my other ones in the same size, so I know its not because it isn't fitting right. Plus is puckers just sitting on its own. Still very comfortable, but I am not able to wear it under T-shirts because of the extra fabric that creates odd lines across my chest. I am thinking I just got one that wasn't made correctly.
5	1338336000	Very comfortable bra for pregnancy.  we will see about nursing! It does not provide great shape but great comfort.  I definitely recommend this product.
5	1338076800	Awesome bra and worth the money. I got this is ivory and beige and it didn't disappoint!  I wore them both for the last month of my pregnancy and they actually lifted my boobs off of my belly, were SUPER comfortable and I know will be awesome when I start nursing later this week.
4	1337904000	i have been using it for sport most of all since i delivered my baby and for 2 years while breastfeeding, i wish it was made of cotton,thats why i couldnt sleep in it.
5	1337472000	This bra is extremley comfortable and easy to use. I was skeptical of this bra as i typicaly wear padded underwire bra (i dont love the shape of my breast,) but this bra exceeded my standards. Great to wear all day or bed. Would highly recommend this bra to any nursing mom.
3	1337126400	Before getting pregnant I had a bra size of 34DD and by the 15th week of pregnancy I was busting out of all my bras in the most uncomfortable way.I had really high hopes for this bra based on the reviews so I ordered two- a medium and a large because per the chart I need a medium for the band, but I knew the cup size would likely be too small....and I was right.The medium: Provided me with more support than the large, but I had to use the hooks that make it tightest and I have already maxed out the cup size and even have a little boob poking out the side.The large: Great cup size, but poor support. I have to wear this with a tank top that has a built is bra/support.This bra also doesn't give you very good separation...it's not quite to the point where it will give you a uniboob, but it's close.Basically, this is just an okay bra. It's better than wearing my pre-pregnancy bras which cut into my skin and leave marks after only an hour...and this bra is probably great for people with smaller cup sizes than me but I wouldn't buy another one.
4	1337126400	I love the comfort this bra offers, but you definitely can't wear it w/camisoles for Summer. The straps are rather wide. Also, the pads inside the cups move out of place sometimes. Other than that, it's great. It's very plain and is a great bra for night time.
2	1336521600	The bra is too small in the band even though I ordered the right size. Now I need to buy a bra band extender. I also think the cup size is too small and I'm trying  it on two weeks prior to the baby's birth. If my breasts enlarge with milk, this bra will definitely not fit. I am going to buy all future nursing bras in person. I think its worth it to do the research.
3	1336348800	Pros: comfortable, seems sturdyCons: boob-loafI was so sad this bra didn't work for me, after all the awesome reviews. I've had zero luck finding a bra I like! So sad!!! This bra seems comfortable and sturdy, but I was really hoping it would provide a little better shape and support. I don't know why most nursing bras are wirless. I don't like the uniboob, hanging out the side look.
4	1336089600	The bra is very soft and comfortable, the opening system works very well and there are (theoretically) many colours to choose from as oppose to most other nursing bras that only come in white, black or beige. The only but is the pad that comes inside it: it doesn't stay close to the breast appearing "bumpy" on the edges, specially if you wear a fitted top. I bought 3 colours of this bra and the beige colour is the worse in terms of padding, the dark pink is the best one.
5	1336003200	This is an excellent nursing bra - very well made and it is comfortable to wear even at night.  I was a 36A before getting pregnant, now I'd guess I'm around a B/C cup, so I purchased this in the medium size and it fits very well. I am finding that it is holding up well after multiple washings (machine wash, hang to dry).
5	1336003200	I have read the negative reviews and have come to the conclusion that if you are very large breasted, this may not be for you.  I was a 34B before pregnancy and am a 34C now.  I bought the small of this in teal from Target.com about 6 months ago.  Have washed it several times, used it almost continuously (as it is my favorite).  My only issue was that is is bright teal and so I had to only wear dark shirts with it.  Teal was the only color Target had.  I then found it on here in all different colors.  I was hesitant to order because I wanted to make sure it was the same bra I loved so much.  I ordered the butterscotch as I needed something "nude" to wear under white shirts.  It arrived yesterday and I wore it all day today.  I am so in love with this product! I am taking the plunge and ordering 2 more (black and ivory).  I have bought other nursing bras from Target and from Motherhood and hate all of them (they are going to Goodwill today- all of them!).  This is so far the ONLY nursing bra I love and will now become the only nursing bra I will wear.I have been breastfeeding for 9 months now and this covers all of my needs.  It is comfortable (no wires or seams or itchy lace).  It is supportive (no floppy boobies- and I even use it while running).  It is durable (have washed it at least twice a week for 6 months and still looks and feels and functions like new).  It is easy to use (one had unlatch and doesn't creep up on baby's chin while nursing)Side note:  I did remove the removable pads permanently and like the look without them much better.  The pads are good if you are still leaking, but I have now regulated enough that leaking is very rare and usually only overnight.They are cheaper here than on Target.com (by about $5).  The cost is higher than other target bras, but the quality far exceeds them and I will likely still use it as a sports bra after I am done nursing (Yes for smaller boobs it IS that supportive).
1	1336003200	INITIAL IMPRESSION: I just got this bra in the mail, and it's amazing!  Super comfy!!  I was a little reluctant to get it after reading some reviews about the fit for larger sizes, but I am so glad I did!  I'm 8 months pregnant and my 38 D/DD bras have been getting tight and uncomfortable.  I ordered a L and it fits perfectly, with ample room to stretch once my milk comes in.AFTER THREE WEEKS: Not so happy with this bra now : (  I purchased two bras and within three weeks one of the back hooks on both bras has broken.  Also, the bras are already losing support, and at this point are really not offering much more support than the cheap nursing tanks from Target (purchased after my last pregnancy) that have been worn for close to two years.  This bra is not worth the money!
5	1335916800	This bra is a little pricey, but totally worth it!  I have tried several bras from Target and Motherhood and there is no comparison.  This is the best nursing bra I have tried because it meets all of the following criteria: good support (currently at a 38D) good shape (removable pads), good for work or home, comfy enough to sleep in, machine washable, easily hooks/unhooks with one hand, and low cut enough to wear with normal tops.  I found the bra to be true to the sizing chart.  I will be purchasing more of these and getting rid of all the others!
5	1334880000	I've been nursing my son for one year now and I've bought 3 of these bras. I love them! They are so comfortable and look nice under clothing. I'm a 32C and I ordered a size small. The bra is supportive enough for me. They do stretch out a little after time, so if you are between sizes, I would go for the smaller size.
4	1334707200	This is a pretty good nursing bra.  The material is thick and stiffer and that gives good support.  I like that when you undo it to nurse it gives you a lot of room.  I was happy with it but it does seem to cost more than I think it is worth.
5	1334707200	This bra is excellent! The soft material and flexible structure make it very comfortable to wear, yet it is also surprisingly supportive for a bra without an underwire. I also really like the blue ice color. :)
5	1334361600	I'm giving this 5 stars because Breakout Bras was easy to deal with and I was able to return the bra with ease which I appreciate.  Although, the bra itself didn't work for me.  It is a nice, high quality bra and I think it lived up to the Bravado reputation.  I am 32/34 A and the smallest size was just to big for me in the cups.  It looked awkward and there was no way I could have pulled it off.  If you have a smaller chest, look elsewhere.
5	1334102400	This bra is so comfortable that I can sleep in it which is great for some extra support for tender breasts. The clasps are easy to use - even one-handed which is great. Washes well.  Thinking about getting a couple more since we just started nursing :)
5	1333929600	I know this bra is on the pricier side, but it is worth every penny. I was really frustrated with the nursing bra's I had purchased from Motherhood and Target. They weren't super supportive and I felt very self conscious about how much lower they seemed and how...bouncy they were without my sturdy molded cup & underwire. This bra has three clasps and several adjustable rows for a tighter fit. And its VERY supportive. The sizing chart they provide is tricky though. For refernce I am a 36E, and bought a large. (I had originally purchased and XL, but it was too big!)Overall, I'm very happy with this bra.
5	1333238400	I believe this is the absolute best nursing bra.  I waited to buy mine 1 week postpartum at the hospital to make sure it fit.  It was immediate relief when I put it on.  I use mine without the foam cups most of the time, but put them in when I go out.This is a very stretchy bra that is good for those first few months when your breasts change in size throughout the day.  Sure, you cannot jog in this bra, but that is not what it is for.I bought two of these bras in XL.  Then at 10 months I bought another in size L because I shrunk down and lost a lot of weight (yeah nursing!).  Now at 1 year I still use my Bravado Silk size L around the house and to sleep in, and I have an underwire Anita 5035(Anita Maternity Women's Underwire Nursing Bra  #5035) for going out and jogging.
5	1333152000	I purchased two types of nursing bras before this Bravado Silk Seamless. I love that it's seamless, the straps are nice and thin but are comfortable and offer great support, you can open with one hand, they wash nicely, come with an easily removable pad... My only complaint would be that the cleavage cover is rather high and peeks out of a lot of my tops; luckily it kind of looks like a cami so I don't sweat it too much. Very happy with this product and wish I had found it sooner!
5	1332547200	I have to wear these at night to keep my Bamboobies breast pads in place.  If I try wearing a sleep bra, the pads don't stay in place and don't work at all.  This bra is very comfortable, even to sleep in.  I loved it during pregnancy as it was the only bra I could get to fit comfortably.  My band size really increased in pregnancy so I was wearing the XL with an extra bra extender on the largest size.  Now I am wearing this bra in XL on the tightest setting.  I would definitely order a size up if you are between sizes.  Very comfortable both with and without the removable padding.  I bought a nude (Butterscotch) at first and just bought another in black.  My son likes to play "bow and arrow") with the elastic that stays when you remove the bra part to nurse and even though it is really stretched out now it still works great.  Very very comfortable.  I really don't think I am a 46 F as the XL supposedly goes to (used to be a 38B/C pre-pregnancy) but the XL fits great.  Your breast size and band size changes a lot during pregnancy and early and late breastfeeding so it's nice to have room to grow and I love that this bra fits perfectly no matter what size I am.  Breastfeeding is very easy with a stretchy-necked shirt and this bra.  It took me a little while to get used to re-clamping it one-handed but now it's easy.
5	1332460800	I've really liked having this nursing bra.  It is super comfortable and looks good under shirts.  The padding is also a very nice feature, and has saved me multiple times from leaks showing through.  I also had bought an Anita lace nursing bra, and I think this one is MUCH better all around.
5	1332115200	So comfortable. I have 3 and am almost never without wearing one. I sleep in this bra as well as wear it out. Highly recommend.
5	1331769600	Supportive yet not constricting.  Love the fabric - breathable and doesn't irritate skin.  The hook is up a bit higher than some of my nursing tanks (as some others point out on various web sites), but it is still my favorite nursing bra (ordered another because I liked it so much).  I got used to the hook being up a bit higher after a few tries.  Also comes with metal hooks so that you can covert it to a regular bra when you are done using it as a nursing bra.  Sizing chart seemed accurate to me - I was on the verge between a medium and large and the medium has been fine for me.
5	1331769600	I bought this bra when I was about 6 months pregnant with my second child.  I wore it almost every day for the rest of the pregnancy-it was so comfortable!  I wear it as a sleep bra now, but sometimes I still wear it during the day.  I do not like wearing it without the removeable pads that come with it.  I would prefer that they were not removeable because I have to put them back in every time I wash it.  It has a very nice shape, and as a very small framed small chested person who has always worn only push-up bras, I am pleasantly surprised to be comfortable wearing this bra out in public.  It does not make my chest look too small as most bras like this would do.  Overall, I am very happy with this bra and would recomend it to others.
5	1331251200	I tried 4 nursing bras before buying this one and hated them all.  This one is different and definitely worth the price.  It is very supportive and extremely comfortable.  It holds its shape well so your chest still looks normal right after nursing.  It's easy to attach and detach one handed.  It looks great under all types of shirts.  I recommend this to all my friends who plan on nursing.  I also plan on wearing this bra the next time I'm pregnant.  This is the only brand of nursing bras for me.
4	1330905600	this bra is super comfortable, even for sleeping.  unlike some other bras, the 2 cups are well separated so my breast pads do not move around when i sleep.  i wear a 34d these days, and the medium is roomy, but fits fine.  probably could have gone with a small for cup size, but the medium is roomy for when breasts are full.
4	1330473600	I love this bra. I can wear it when I am lounging around the house (not that "lounging" really exists anymore with a young one), out and about, or sleeping. I haven't experienced a bra that is so flexible in its use prior to this one. The fit is great, and at my size (32F) that can be difficult to come by. This bra offers the best support I've encountered yet without having to deal with an uncomfortable underwire. The nursing clips are easy to unfasten with one hand, and with a little practice I've gotten pretty good at refastening with one hand.Why 4 stars instead of 5? There are a few reasons. First, I find the foam cups to be of no value to me. They show through. This was easily solved by removing them from the bra via slots in the side of the cup.  Second, I wish the fabric was just a little thicker. This would allow for better coverage. Lastly, I don't know if it's just my bra or if it is a flaw in design, but the elastic bands on the side of the cup that are intended to maintain the shape of the bra when the cups are released are not the appropriate length. They are quite long, and adjusting the straps doesn't affect their length. None of these reasons keeps me from loving this bra, and as an added bonus, the bra conversion kit that accompanies the bra allows extended use after breastfeeding is finished. Great product. Makes life as a nursing mother much simpler. :)
5	1330300800	These bras are the only ones I have found that fit well, conform to the body, feel comfortable, and work effectively for the nursing mom. They last a long time as well! Highly recommended.
5	1329955200	I am 38 weeks and purchased this bra for the end of my pregnancy and for breastfeeding. I was immediately very happy with my decision! It is comfortable and I feel that it has enough support for me, I even wear it to work! I was a 38 DDD pre-pregnancy and I've since grown to a 40 F. I ordered the XL, and I am confident that this will expand if my bust increases any further. Also, since the band is adjustable I am confident that I will be able to use it once I lose some weight. I plan to buy another, love it!!
2	1329955200	This is no different than any other wireless/soft cup bra- other than it unclaspes in the front. Save yourself the $$ and just buy 2-3 that you pull down from anywhere. Not impressed.
4	1329696000	I know others have complained about the look of this bra compared to the photos in the advertisement.  I definitely recommend using the cup liners that come with the bra- without them, this bra IS thin and does not have a 'smooth' cup appearance.  I've been very pleased with wearing this bra with the cup liners under t-shirts- it doesn't appear at all that I have a nursing bra on.I wear this bra at night too and it offers GREAT support- I tried going without it and my breasts were very sore.  The sides are easy to unlatch/latch and the 'clasps' seem pretty heavy-duty.I have been very pleased with this nursing bra and now own two of them.  They are a little pricey, but I like the look of them and the support they offer.I'd definitely recommend!  The sizing was pretty right-on too- I wear a 34B and ordered the small.UPDATE: After 7 months, the bras are still in good shape, however the inner elastic straps (on the inside part where the cups unhook and flap down for feeding) are really getting stretched out/worn out.
5	1329436800	Can anyone tell me if this is style number 1401? I would so appreciate it. I want to make sure I order the right one.
3	1329264000	The jury is still out on the support/ convenience of this since I bought it ahead of my delivery and only tested it out for a day. However, I can say right off the bat that there is a lot of thick fabric here. This can feel restrictive and also make you hot/ warm. So while this was recommended by many sites (I researched!), I would say go for something else that has less fabric and makes you feel cool and free.Of course, I'm also the kind of person that values comfort above all else. If you are like that woman I saw yesterday walking down the street in 4 inch heels, super tight muffin-inducing jeans and 3 inches of make up on.. then you probably won't mind this.
5	1329177600	This is my second child and I didn't even bother looking at other options in nursing bras. With my first, I tried everything, in every price range. When my daughter was about 2 months old, I was in a swanky maternity boutique and the woman behind the counter recommended these. By then, I had just resigned myself to uncomfortable bras for the duration of my nursing experience. I was so tired of everything else that I paid what seemed like an outrageous price for this and took it home.Oh. My. God.I almost cried. They are that good. This time around, I ordered 2 of these, plus one of the cotton 'original' ones to sleep in (from the Bravado website). I have been wearing them as maternity bras this last month and they are just as fantastic as I remember. I don't know exactly what it is, but between the material and the dimensions, they just work. I recommend them to everyone I can - they are worth the money, don't be turned off at the price because if you nurse for a while, you will live in them and they will more than pay for themselves.
5	1328832000	Wear this pretty much every day. So comfortable and soft. Works under most normal shirts, easily clips on and clips off so I don't even need to look at the clasp for middle-of-the-night feedings. I have tried other brands and styles, but nothing compares to this bra for nursing.
4	1328745600	This bra is very comfortable and fits well all throughout the day. The bra stretches when your breasts are full and conforms when they are not. The pads in the bra were better with older models, but they are still very nice. The pads do their job of hiding a let-down as I've never leaked onto my shirt while wearing this bra. Great buy!
5	1328745600	I have three now - the medium size. I usually wear 34-36 B - and these are very comfortable and convenient. I've used them for over 8 months now. I wash them in the washer with my regular clothes, but I hang dry them. Highly recommend for anyone who is about my size.
5	1328572800	After purchasing 3-4 cheap nursing bras at various other stores (ones that I thought were comfortable at the store, but then got home and realized they weren't that great), I bought one of these.  I ended up wearing it every day and by 6 months, I decided I better buy another one so I wouldn't have to wear my other ones when I was washing this one!  All in all, a great bra.  I am normally a 36B, but while nursing, I was a 38C and bought a Large.  It fit very well and as other reviewers have said: you get what you pay for.  Don't make the mistake of buying other bras; buy this one first.
2	1328572800	This bra has such great reviews I was so excited to order it after reading a million nursing bra reviews on Amazon. I was so disappointed when I received it, because the product description states the fabric content is nylon and spandex, but that is totally incorrect.Here is the fabric content from the label of the package:Fiber content (exclusive of trim) 90% nylon 10% spandexFoam cup insert - lining 100% polyesterFoam 100% polyurethaneUnfortunately, I have extremely sensitive skin, and am allergic to all polyester clothing. It makes my skin itch and burn the minute I put it on. I put the bra on when it arrived to see how it fit, and immediately felt my skin itching. I took it off in surprise, and looked at the package to discover the lining is polyester!  The satin trim around the edges is also polyester I'm guessing, since it was just as irritating to my skin. Sooo disappointed as I will have to keep hunting for the right nursing bra.
5	1328572800	You have shopped for the perfect nursing bra.  You are frustrated.  You want one that allows easy access for feeding baby, pumping when you go back to work, but at the same time gives you at least a little shape since you have always worn moulded bras in the past.  THIS IS THE BRA FOR YOU.  Seriously, stop shopping around and buy this one - it's worth the extra money.  I was a 32B before baby, 34C during pregnancy and now fluctuate between a 34C and 34D (mostly 34C) during breastfeeding and the Medium is the perfect size for me.  It actually gives a nice shape under clothes and I couldn't love it more.  And let me tell you - I think I tried every bra there is.  This is THE ONE.
5	1328313600	Every mom who nurses should have this bra. My friend recommended this bra to me but it took me awhile to order it since I thought it was too pricey.. however, I am so glad I finally decided to order. It is the most comfortable nursing bra i have ever put on. I swear. It is so comfortable and supports my aching breasts wonderfully. love  love this bra.
4	1328140800	This is my third type of everyday-wear nursing bra. I previously owned two bras from Madela, which were comfortable but impossible to re-hook with one hand. They were good for pumping at work but not for on-the-go nursing when out with baby. I recently purchased two new underwire bras from Motherhood Maternity. Neither fits well due to natural changes in breast size throughout the day. One of the underwires poked through the bra within a few weeks and they are both uncomfortable. (Don't go with an underwire. I'm a 38 D/E. Underwire nursing bras are just a bad idea!)I just purchased the Bravado last week and have worn it three times. Wow, what a difference. I'm ordering another one today. The only complaint I have is that the included padding (great for covering up pokey nipples and stopping leaks) bunches up while nursing. It just takes a moment to readjust but has provided for a few awkward moments where it looks like I've stuffed an actual box of tissues in my bra. Otherwise, wonderful nursing bliss. I've actually felt comfortable enough to nurse in public with this bra because I can handle the bra with one hand and the baby with the other.
5	1327708800	This bra has totally spoiled me.  I'm no longer nursing but this bra is so comfy that I just can't go back to my old bras.  It doesn't do any lifting if you need that, but if comfort is what you are going for this bra is great.
5	1327276800	Ordered this a month ago, along with the Bravado! Designs Bliss Nursing Soft Cup Bra and have been wearing them non stop.  This bra is my favorite of the two.  I am generally a strict underwire girl, but my twins runneth over and the wire divides where it should not.I missed the part where the pads are removable and only realized when one fell out in the wash.  Took them out and I love this bra!  It's great for sleeping also.I am a big girl and measured a 40 DD when I ordered this XL.  It fits fine on a middle hook, holds the girls with authority and has room for when my milk comes in (due in 3 weeks).The straps are easily adjustable, the nursing hooks are easily manipulated with one hand and after loads of washes and dryer times (wearing every other day and washed every time (I wear them for about 24 hours...) it looks brand new.I had a medela for my last pregnancy and found the fabric to give me rashes when I sweat, and the boob covers sagged so when a shirt runs a little bit low you can see clearly that I am wearing a nursing bra.  Gross.While this bra is twice the cost, it is so worth it.
4	1327276800	It may be sized a little small, because I went up a size (am usually a medium, but ordered a large) and it fits great. I chose this bra based on reviews and the fact that I was looking for a sturdier, supportive option to wear for work or for going out, instead of just a soft-lined sleeping bra which I'm most comfortable in usually. Agree with earlier reviews that the snaps are tough to use one-handed and don't snap off quickly which is a little annoying when you need to do it quickly! Also agree that the removable pads in the cups is a bit awkward. Otherwise, I like this product because of the support it provides and that it looks good (e.g. seamless) under clothes. Was skeptical because of the price tag, but just ordered a second one after wearing the first one for several weeks.
5	1327017600	I just got this bra today. I put it on... instant heaven. Not something I can say about most bras, AT ALL. It's so comfortable that I barely feel like I'm wearing anything, except better - because this has support. I'll be buying more, absolutely. This beats every other nursing bra I own, by a long shot.
5	1326672000	Purchased this bra about 8 weeks post-partum; we are now almost ten months into our nursing adventure.  Was great then, is great now! Certainly is more adaptable than other more-structured bras (especially if you're asymmetric) while still providing excellent coverage.  Looks great under clothes. Will definitely purchase again.
5	1326412800	This bra gives support but still moves with your body.  The best, most comfortable nursing bra I have found.  Worth the money!
5	1326153600	I usually NEVER buy bras online since that's something I need to try on before purchasing, but after reading many reviews on many different nursing bras, I finally decided to give this one a shot. I'm so glad I did! It's a little pricier than some of the other ones I was looking at, but it's well worth it to have a supportive, comfortable nursing bra that I can sleep in. I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the padding is very awkward and bulges, which is visible even under a shirt, but since I strictly use this bra for nighttime and don't need the pads, it's not an issue for me. This bra is very soft and extremely comfortable and although some people have said you can't snap and unsnap it with one hand, I've found that it's possible with a little practice. Overall, a great product!!
3	1326067200	It's a good bra - especially for early days of nursing. Would recommend for the bra you buy before your baby's birth. Was very comfortable during engorgement. 4 months later, I'm less excited about this bra. The removable cups are annoying - they don't stay in place for me - end up folded over and then I'm left with either strange bra lines or trying to fish the thing out and replace it. I really like to have the lining because of nipple-show. It does a good job of smoothing everything out :) So, I'd give it a higher rating if the the liner stayed in place (not sure why it's removable to begin with . . .)
4	1325548800	Overall, a very nice bra. Comfortable to sleep in. I feel it runs a bit on the small side. 4 stars instead of 5 because the snaps can be difficult to use with just one hand and the straps could be a bit wider. I started wearing this bra at the end of my pregnancy, and am using it after delivery so long term use is possible which makes up for the high price.
5	1325376000	I had a few people tell me the Bravado nursing bras were the best.  I was skeptical, I mean how different can they be from all other nursing bras.  So after my son was born I headed over to the baby/mommy boutique in our hospital to check out bras, and this was one of the ones I tried on.  It was much softer and I liked the fact it stretched with you, instead of being a firm cup, since throughout your nursing season your size changes.  I bought one, since at $50 a pop I wanted to make sure I loved it.  I later went to Motherhood Maternity and picked up another bra, it rarely got worn, since it was not very comfortable, and eventually I bought a second Bravado.  I just bought one for my best friend who is about to have her first baby, and she already loves it, as she has been wearing it already.Would definitely recommend this bra to any mom-to-be or currently nursing mom.
5	1325289600	I got this bra hoping for something at least a little more comfortable than the one from the Motherhood store, and I was pleasantly surprised! I love this bra, and will continue to use it even after I am done nursing. It is comfortable in fit as well as fabric, and is very easy to nurse in. I have been recommending it to everyone I know who is pregnant or wanting to become so soon!
5	1324684800	It's exactly as described by the other reviewers.  I've been reading reviews and searching for comfortable and supportive nursing bras, and these fit the bill.  I didn't want to take it off once I tried  it on. My other bras and sports bra makes me feel like I can't breath. I'm  34 C and ordered size S.  In fact, I just ordered two more in ice blue and ivory.  The chest band fits comfortably.  I like the fact that I reach and adjust the straps from the front.  I like the removalbe pads in the front to hide my crazy big nipples.  These are also going in my rotation as a sports/workout bra - not enough support for jogging but good for elliptical and low impact workouts.
3	1324684800	I love this bra when i wear it but i hate it when i need to breastfeed. the pad crumples and sleeve falls from my shoulders.i wouldn't buy it as a nursing bra agai.
5	1324598400	I never, ever write reviews, but I had to for this product.  After purchasing WAY too many nursing bras that were not supportive and did not fit well, I came across this one on amazon.  It is AMAZING!  Finally a bra that is supportive and comfortable!  I am a 38G right now, and the large fits well.  I could use a little more coverage under the arms, but I think the XL would have been too big around.  I cannot say enough good things about this bra...the support finally makes me feel a little more like I did prebaby.
5	1324425600	This is the most comfortable bra I own - nursing or not! It has little support, but it's perfect for a bra around the home or even as a sleep bra.I highly recommend this bra!
5	1324252800	I really love this bra! I have been able to wear it under t-shirts and thinner shirts. It is easy to use and supportive even though it doesn't have an underwire. Very comfortable.
3	1324252800	I'm large chested and just could never get used to wearing a soft cup bra out during the day...This is nicely made and has nice features but I really missed my underwires.  Lactation consultants will recommend that you not wear underwire but I have never had a problem with supply.
1	1323993600	The removable foam cups were terrible.  They created embarrassing seams and were a pain to get in and out of the bra.  I also thought they were very difficult to smooth out when being placed into the designated pockets ( they kept wanting to roll up).I exchanged this bra for the Bravado Bliss style which does not have removable pads -- I love it and highly recommend this style instead.
3	1323820800	Pros:+ Ridiculously comfy compared to most nursing bras and bras in general. Really great, soft stretchy material.+ No nipple show-through (with the provided pads) and ok shape with t-shirts+ No seams+ I wear a 32H and while the smallest band setting on size M was a little loose, it was good enough. The "cups" offered decent coverage.Cons:- Weird, sort of lumpy breast pads that can show through clothing.- A bit of a "uni-boob" effect- Not a very pretty bra in general.I'm on the fence about this nursing bra. I'm in my second trimester and thus not nursing yet, and I think this bra offers enough stretch to grow with my breasts when my milk comes in. I'm not sure I would wear it out unless I'm wearing layers, because the breast pads give it such a strange look (and without pads there's a lot of nipple show-through). I think it would make an excellent sleep and at-home bra, at the very least.
5	1323734400	Love the product. Easy to use and comfortable! Two things that are important when nursing. I just ordered a third one.
4	1323648000	I would wear this bra all the time, but it's missing one thing, a little bit more padding. The pads are removable, and thin, so it doesn't provide much coverage. Other than that it's a great bra, comfy, easy to unsnap and supportive.
5	1323648000	I was recommended this bra by a local shop owner and resisted because it just didn't look like it would lift and separate very well.  BUT, I tried it on in my last month of my 2nd pregnancy and it became my favorite bra.  At the end of my pregnancy I just couldn't handle an underwire, even though I am a 38 G sometimes H.  I wasn't sure about the sizing info covering my size, but I tried on the L and XL at the shop and found the XL to be a very comfortable fit.  The L was a bit too low in the armpit area for my liking -- too much overhang.  However, the XL had wonderful coverage and it is SOOOO comfortable.  And it doesn't smoosh everything together.  Most importantly, everything is contained!  In addition, the nursing clips are low profile and easy to use.  I have 2 more (in different cute colors) on my wish list.  I'm so very happy with this bra.  I highly recommend it for larger sizes.
5	1323388800	This bra is awesome for daily use, although I wouldn't recommend for sleeping. However, I have never liked sleeping with a bra, so I had to get something that was completely unlined and seamless, but this bra is GREAT for during the day.
5	1323043200	I love this bra. i have no intention of giving it up when I stop nursing. My son is a year and a half and Ive been wearing this bra every day since. The only thing was the elastic that held the two end of the catch together eventually did give out, so I cut it off and now I have a bra I can take off from under my clothes without having to do that akward sleeves/arms/bra maneuver. But it gives lovely support, and I'm fairly busty. The elastic is wide and soft and smoothing. I have two. I keep the tan one without the breast pads, for ease and relaxation, and i keep the black one with the breast pads for working, to keep the nippliness to a minimum.
4	1322870400	I bought the Bravado nursing bra with all intentions of wearing it once I had baby number three. Unfortunately, I couldnt wait. It looked so comfy and my other bras were so binding. I love the fit. Its comfortable, has great nipple coverage, the bra straps stay put, and the color is perfect for all of my white tops. My only complaint is the support. I notice my breasts (which are not so perky after breastfeeding two kiddos) are looking rather droopy in the bra. I guess part of the problem is my breasts are rather droopy! I was hoping they would look higher, like the models, but the bra does not provide that type of support for me- or that type of lift. If I lay down in this bra, on my side, I get the dreaded uniboob- wish there was a partition to keep my breasts separated, especially since I like to nurse while lying on my side. Overall a very comfortable bra and the butterscotch color is a great neutral!
3	1322524800	Not sure what the hype was about, but I hate this bra!! It has no support! It's not even comfortable to sleep in! And I spent SO much for a bra I hate! Unfortunately, I did not purchase from Amazon, so I could not return it! (Original post)** I have edited this from 1 star to 3 stars. After my milk supply finally balanced, the bra has become more comfortable. It still does not have the support I'd like, but if I tighten the straps and fasten to the last hooks, it gives enough support that I can live with it until I'm done nursing. At my size I don't have many options, but compared with some other nursing bras I've tried, this one is the most comfortable.
5	1322352000	I'm currently still pregnant, but when I received this bra, I tried it on and haven't taken it off.  It stays in place and is seamless under clothes.  I ordered a medium and am currently wearing a 36C.
1	1321833600	I have hated looking for nursing bras, because I don't want to spend lots of money on them, and I have a hard time finding regular bras that fit well. I had high hopes for this bra, but it did not work out.  I am large chested - 36D/DD (depending on the bra)and E cup, now that I am nursing, and this bra did not support me well at all.  The material is soft, but it has almost no support.  The removable "cups" that are a little more molded give a weird shape, and do not stay in place AT ALL.  I don't even like to wear this bra to bed, because my boobs almost fall out of the bra if I'm laying on my side.  For those ladies with larger chests, this bra feels like a bra you might have worn at one time that made your breasts jiggle around when you walked, but this feels even worse.  I do not recommend this bra at all.  For me it was a waste of money.  There may be others for whom this bra works well, based on all the stellar reviews, but it was definitely NOT for me!
5	1321747200	My wife is nursing our first baby and we have tried various nursing bras, but my wife has very sensitive skin and we have gone through half a dozen nursing bras. Having read the reviews here, we decided to give it a go and have this shipped from half the world away.Our big gamble paid off when she put it on - this bra is made of soft material and the clasp snaps on and off with a comfortably firm click. The strap and the elastic support is broad and does not cause irrtation when worn for long hours. Time will tell if this will prove to be lasting, but this is by far the most comfortable so far.
5	1321747200	It's a really great bra. I got it as a gift and wasn't sure about it cause of the mixed reviews I read on it. When it came in I got a 38D and I was wearing a 38C that was getting a little tight. The transition was nice. It is a really comfortable bra all in all. The breast pad part is a little bulky and will probably show a wrinkle if you wear a tight shirt. It's a nice bra all in all. Ya, every bra has it's ups and downs but this one is something I am happy about so I got another one.
5	1321574400	I ended up with 4 of these after being highly recommended by a friend and after 5 months I still like them alot. They are amazingly supportive for not having a wire. And easy to snap with one hand. I originally wore them out of the house with the pads when I was more self conscious about my wireless shape, but have become more relaxed and have ditched the pads completely and am still happy with the shape they give.
5	1321401600	Great bra and worth every penny. Wore it 3 weeks prior to delivery because it was so comfortable.  Bought additional bras so I would have plenty!
5	1321401600	I purchased this bra based on all the great reviews it got on Amazon as well as other websites. This is a top-rated nursing bra. I am almost 6 months pregnant, but I wanted to get something now because my bras are getting too tight on me and I didn't want to invest in larger bras before having to buy more bras for nursing. This bra is absolutely perfect! It's double-duty. I think it can take you from pregnancy to nursing and beyond if you choose. I love the feel of the fabric and I love the support it provides. I started out at a 34 DD (pre-pregnancy) and I was torn between buying the M or L. I'm glad I chose the L because I will have room to grow(right now I am at the tightest setting and it's very comfortable). I highly recommend this bra!! It's a bit pricey, but I think it's a good investment since I plan to use it during my pregnancy, nursing and beyond.
5	1321315200	I have tried several other nursing bras ranging from $14-$70 and this is my favorite of them all!! I just purchased my third one and wish I had had this with my first baby. The fit is supportive, comfortable for all day (or even all night) wear, looks great under clothing, and the nursing pad built-in is a must have!! It is hard enough to feel 'sexy' or even just 'good' about yourself after having a baby, and then on top of that, who wants to wear a thin, unsupportive bra that you have to wear a clumpy nursing pad with? This bra allows a smooth look under clothing without the appearance of a uni-boob either! I cannot recommend this bra enough for nursing mothers!
3	1320883200	After paying $50 for a nursing bra, I was expected something that was truly extraordinary, honestly. I liked it when it first came out of the package, but after multiple washes (and by multiple, I mean three or four), I found the material to be less soft than other products of similar material. Also, if felt as thought it had stiffened up or something. I did follow care instructions, so it's not like I botched the item.I guess I'm comparing this microfiber material to other brands of products I own: Lululemon, Nike, Lucy, etc. Those products are great. This product is not worth the money. I'd say it's worth $20.I did end up purchasing an Anita (?) bra in addition to this one and I find the Anita MUCH better. The material is softer (granted, it's a different product altogether), but if you're looking for a comfortable bra that's soft against sore spots on your skin (nipples) I would not recommend this product.
5	1320796800	I purchased one of these shortly before my now 13-month old son was born. I was hesitant to buy it before I knew if breastfeeding would work out, but I am so glad I did. I honestly don't know how I would have made it through the first few weeks without this bra. I purchased a second one almost immediately and have used them both constantly over the past 13 months. My son is still nursing, so I plan to keep using these until he's done. A few comments:1. I have always preferred very supportive, underwire bras. Even though it's not an underwire this bra is very supportive. I'm pretty average size (32/34 C) so I can't speak for larger chested women however.2. I like that this bra has the removable pads. I always use them plus disposable nursing pads for two reasons. One is that I leaked a lot and two is that it meant that I never had a problem with any unwanted poking through my shirt if you know what I mean.3. This bra washed and wears well. Like I said, 13 months of non-stop use and it's still going strong.4. This bra really works well throughout all the growing and shrinking that happens to your chest during the course of a year (or even just a day) of breastfeeding!
4	1320796800	I absolutely love these bras as they are super comfy. I have it in black and nude, and it's all I wear, day and for sleep. I have to give it a 4 star however for two reasons. First, the pad inserts are a joke. When you pull the bra down to nurse, the pads get all rolled up so you spend a ton of time righting them after nursing. I took them out after about half a day, but I find with a nursing pad, my nipples don't show and I haven't had issues with the nursing pads showing through the bra. Second, the elastic that is used to hold up the strap stretches out. I've only had the bras for under 2 months and the elastic is so stretched out, the straps fall off my shoulder everytime I nurse.However, I would still recommend this bra as the issues are able to be overlooked, and since I am large breasted, it's been hard finding s bra that fit and was comfortable and these are fabulous for 24 hour use.

4	1320105600	My son isn't here yet so I haven't actually used this for nursing. I purchased it due to my expanding rib cage and my normal bras not fitting right anymore. This bra has the comfy feel of a sports bra but gives pretty good support. My only criticism is that it is sized sm, med, lg or xl rather than by your measurement number, so the fit isn't perfect. But it does have 4 rows of eyelets to adjust it to so you can get it pretty close. I had purchased another nursing bra at a store in our mall (their best seller) and it is stiff and uncomfortable...not something you're looking for while nursing a newborn. That's why I did the online search. A little more expensive, but worth it.
5	1320105600	I love these bras. They are the most comfortable nursing bras I own and plenty supportive for my 38D/DD chest! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!
4	1320019200	This bra is very comfortable!  The two small complaints I have are that the sizing chart makes it hard to decide on a size, and the elastic that holds the bra on when you flip down the front is loose.  A smaller size would probably have solved both of my small complaints, but it was not worth enough to send it back and wait for a new size.  This bra is so comfortable, I bought a second one.  The best part about this is that it so seamless!
5	1320019200	I'm a new mom and have bought a ton of nursing bras trying to find the right fit...I went from a 34A pre-pregnancy to a 36D, so I really was at a loss as to what to buy and what would work.  Of all the bras I've tried, this is by FAR my favorite.  Even though they're a bit pricier than some others (like at Motherhood and Maternity), the cost is by no means unreasonable and seriously, all my other purchases have fallen to the wayside since really none of them are as comfortable as these.  Because the fabric stretches with you, they are still comfortable even if your breasts become engorged between feedings, and I still feel supported.  While I certainly won't be going for any jogs with these, for everyday use they feel great and I don't ever feel overly jiggly or saggy.  I initially bought the black, which I wear all the time, and just bought an ivory.  I wish they had white instead of ivory, since the ivory straps can't really pass for cami straps if they slip out (I layer camis under every shirt I wear now for extra coverage), but that is a minor issue.  I'll definitely be getting a couple more of these so I don't have to wash the couple I have everyday.
5	1319414400	This is the best nursing bra out there. Let's face it! Nursing is hard enough, post partum is hard enough! Nothing fits right. I tried other bras from the motherhood store and other brands... This one FITS! and it's comfortable!!! It does not clog the ducts, it does not make me feel engorged! It moves it's soft it's flexible, and most of all it is comfortable! AAAAAAHHH... Big sigh of relief!
5	1319241600	This bra was a godsend!  After trying out so many nursing bras and finding them to be either ill fitting, uncomfortable or strange looking under clothes, this one solves all those problems.  It's extremely comfortable on your skin and yet still has plenty of support even for my size D chest.  It also looks great under clothes, which is a huge plus for me.  I just wish I'd found it sooner.
5	1318550400	I ordered this bra about one week postpardum.  I was so sore and the cheap nursing bra I was wearing was making matters worse.  I put this bra on and it was like heaven.  Very supportive and the whole front of the cup pulls down to nurse rather than just a portion (like the crappy bra I bought at Target).  It has removeable pads which I liked to help smooth out the look if you are wearing disposable nursing pads.  I would highly recommend buying this bra before the baby comes.
5	1318464000	I have been searching for a good nursing bra since my first child came into the world three years ago. I am more "front" facing in the chest, and my biggest problem was falling out when I'd bend over.  Also, in a white shirt my "peeking" would show. This bra is everything I have been looking for. I am a 38D and the large fits perfect on the tightest set of closures. I would highly recommend this bra to others. Make sure to measure yourself so that your bra fits!  If you don't know how, google it. I did and got the right sized bra.
4	1318377600	I am nursing my second baby so I have tried a lot of nursing bras.  Almost quit a time or two because nursing bras are SO horrible.  Last time I mostly used the medela under wire bras, but I got a lot of clogged milk ducts.  Plus I am really busty and they did not support as well as one would think from an under wire.  With this baby it was a week before I finally put a medela bra on and I ended up with a clogged milk duct.  So I decided to do some research and find the best nursing bra around no matter the price.  I ended up buying this bra and its surprisingly great.  On their website they have directions for measuring to get the right size.  I followed the directions and was on the border of a L and an XL.  I went with the XL because like I said I am busty.  Its pretty good.  A little big around, but I needed the cup size.  I may end up buying L later on when I am not quite so big.  They support pretty good for a nursing bra.  Maybe even better than some of the under wire nursing bras I have.  And they don't cut into my shoulders.  I would recommend this bra.  And especially from Amazon because its a little cheaper than other places.  I would also recommend getting it toward the end of the pregnancy.  My bras were so uncomfortable toward the of the pregnancy and these would have been much more comfortable.
5	1317859200	I'm a cheap-o on stuff like this, but now I own 2 of this higher-end nursing bras.  Totally worth the money.  So comfortable, durable.  Seem to fit to size for me, one-size bigger than I would wear not pregnant/nursing.  I used disposable pads with these, but never once had a leak.  Go for it.
4	1317859200	This bra is soo comfortable. It is perfect for your third trimester and for nursing. I gave it 4 stars just because sometimes the snap/hook and loose strap bother me but honestly it's not a big deal. Well worth the money.
5	1317772800	it is nice bra. The material is good and comfortable. I buy two of this bra. And will highly recommend to the nursing mom!
4	1317513600	Fits well and a very comfortable nursing bra. I ordered two, one in a classic black & the other in a cream-yellow shade, not quite nude. They look good under clothes, though if wearing something even mildly low cut, the bra will show. It looks like a tank top under the shirt, so this can be useful. The snaps are relatively easy to use, and the cups fold down. Overall a good bra.
5	1317427200	I was hesitant about ordering this bra because I had never tried it on in person and because it is pricey.  That said, after about a month of use, I really, really like these bras. They are super comfortable (almost like a sports bra), but without the unfortunate uni-boob sports bra effect. I like that they have four hook size options in the back rather than the usual three. The back band and straps are wider than I am used to, but I actually like that now too. After reading other reviews, I was concerned that the padded inserts would show through clothing.  While they are quite obvious on the bra itself, I have had no problems with them showing through any type of shirt. I wish this bra was slightly lower cut as it can show when wearing a v-neck top. Additionally, the elastic on the side (that keeps the bra up when you are using the nursing option) takes a bit of getting used to- it seems a little too long for the bra itself.  Overall, though, This bra is a winner because it is very forgiving of changes in cup size and is extremely comfortable and supportive.
5	1317427200	I found this nursing bra on Amazon but went to a local lactation consultant to be measured. I have a small ribcage (32-34) but measure in the DDD+ cup sizes depending on the style of Bravado bra. Their sizes are not 100% consistent across their line but this bra is amazing. I bought a size large and wear it on the second to tightest hook and am considering buying another. I thought I would have to have an underwire since my breasts have gotten HUGE but this bra is very supportive and so silky and comfortable!Update:If you are considering this bra but find the price a little much or want to buy multiples, Bravado now has a line called Bravado Basics (sold @ Target and I think on Amazon) that is about half the price. It does not feel as silky/luxurious or have inserts but it is definitely comparable in comfort and design to this style.
3	1317254400	I've bought several different nursing bras, and I would describe this one as "meh." It's not very supportive if you have a larger chest, and the material tends to warp the longer you wear it. It will do in a pinch.Overall, it seems like a great bra for smaller-chested women, just not for larger-chested nursing moms.
5	1317081600	Ordered two of these, now all I wear!  Can't handle anything underwire while nursing and this still gives great support without the underwire, will likely purchase more
5	1316736000	This has been my life saver post pardom! I love wearing these comfy bras... I ordered 3 of them after I saw how great the first one worked. Really easy to use and wash. :)
5	1316649600	Despite all the rave reviews, I was very skeptical before trying this bra.  I am used to an underwire and lots of support so I didn't think this would work at all for my size (28FF).  But after trying one on in a store finally (a size medium), I have to say it's pretty close to perfect for late pregnancy and early nursing.  I'm 7 months along with my 3rd baby, I know how engorged I get at first and an underwire just doesn't have enough give.  I can barely even feel this bra is on, but it gives a decent seperated shape and no show-through which is usually an issue for me.  I do use the removeable pads, don't find that they shift or show through my shirts.  Have washed (by machine) and line dried 3-4 times and can't even tell it's been used.  Color is VERY pale pink, closer to white I think.  I also have the black one and these are pretty much all I wear.  The band is looser than I'm used to but still pretty supportive considering the material - definately adequate until I get into the nursing routine.  Clips are standard, easy to use, drop all the way down.  I do wish they'd make the sizes a little more specific...an S+ or S++ would be nice like their original bra instead of bumping to a medium with a small band size...but it still is a very nice transitional bra.Updated 9/5/2012:  You can't beat this for the first month or so of nursing....SO comfortable when everything hurts.  I couldn't stand using it after my size settled and all though, it squashed everything together and I always got sweaty which grossed me out.  Happened with every softcup bra I tried so it's not this one specifically, I'm just an underwire girl nursing or not.  It held up great though!  Would definately buy again if I have another baby.
5	1316649600	Loved this bra when I was nursing and love it now! Although I'm no longer breastfeeding, I found this bra to be so comfortable and well-designed, several months later, I'm still wearing it as my primary bra. Great quality. Soft and supportive. I am small-chested, so perhaps a larger-chested woman might feel differently, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
4	1316476800	My mom bought me one of these bras in a cream color after I had my first child.  I liked it so much I bought another one after my second child.  It's comfortable, it's mostly supportive, and I can sleep in it without trouble.  The snaps in the front are great and I don't have any problem keeping them closed as I have with other bras.  My only complaint is that the adjustment pieces on the straps slip a lot.  I have to adjust them once or twice a day.  My favorite feature is the pads.  If you wear any sort of nursing pad with your bra, the removable bra pads keep your front looking smooth which every woman can appreciate.  Nipples don't show through this bra which is also a plus.
5	1316304000	I got this bra several months into nursing.  I had tried several nursing bras from Target, JC penny, etc and was so uncomfortable that I found myself wearing nursing tanks 24/7.  Pre-pregnancy I was a 34 C, but I ordered the Medium size due to nursing expansion, and it fit perfectly.  The instant I put it on, I knew I had found "the one."  It is incredibly comfortable, very adjustable, and you can wear it with or without the foam inserts.  I could put nursing pads under it either way.  It was so comfortable, I continued to wear it even after I stopped nursing.  I looked everywhere for a non-nursing version of this bra, but alas, have not found one.  This bra has survived 10 months of almost daily use while nursing (so expensive I only got one), and lots of machine washing inside a mesh delicates bag.  It is pilling a little on the straps, but still 100% functional.  I'm pregnant again, and wearing it again now that I'm swollen again.  I'm planning to shell out for another one so I can have 2 this time around.  I'll never buy another nursing bra- every other one I tried was so uncomfortable!
2	1316304000	I bought the Seamless Silk bra in Large, and it just doesn't meet my expectations. First of all, I don't really like the material - it doesn't feel very 'silky'. I guess I'm used to cotton bras, and this one feels scratchy to me. Even with the insertable breast pads/cups, it still doesn't provide a nice shape. Not to mention that at night, when I sleep on my side, one breast falls right out and leaks everywhere; the cup doesn't keep the breast in place. I was planning on buying a few colors, but I sure am glad I didn't... still searching for a comfortable nursing bra that provides enough support!!!
4	1316217600	This Bravado bra is very comfortable (most Bravado items are). The support for me (38DD/38E) was good for a nursing bra, especially since there is no under wire. The straps stretch so it does not dig into your shoulders. It holds everything in, which is hard to find for bigger busts. The one complaint I have about this bra is that it creates a bulge of cleavage at the top, which is noticeable under clothes and is unattractive in my opinion.
5	1316131200	I LOVE this nursing bra. It's super comfortable (soft material, no seams, very comfortable band), easy to hook/unhook and durable (wears and washes well). I've tried several other nursing bras through out nursing my first two children, but when it comes time to grab a bra out of my drawer, this was always my go-to nursing bra. The downside to this bra is that doesn't provide a lot of shape, it's best for those first few weeks (size is very forgiving in both band size and cup size) and daily wear when your looking to be practical and comfortable. It also discreet as it comes with removable pads if you need them and wears well with disposable pads.If you're looking to wear lower cut shirts or show off more shape, then you'll probably need a nursing bra with underwire and two distinct cups (but I've found those to be less forgiving in size, so I found it best to wait until size has stabilized after a few months).
2	1316131200	It's nice that this bra comes with padded inserts for better coverage, but it would be better if the padding was just sewn into the bra. The pads gets twisted and turned and even when they're in the correct position, they poke out awkwardly.I got a Basics by Bravado bra at Target for half the price that I like better.
4	1316044800	I ordered this bra based on the good reviews, and because I used Bravado nursing bras with my first child as well. This bra is very comfortable -- I used it for sleeping and plan on wearing it around the house. Since I'm a 36H, it doesn't offer a ton of support/shaping for going out and I'll use my more structured nursing bra for that.I ordered an XL based on the size charts, and the cups fit great but it is a little bit big through the back. I have it closed on the tightest hook & loop closure. A large may have fit my ribcage better (a 36) but I'm afraid that the cups would have been too small.Overall, a great, comfortable bra.
5	1315958400	This bra is everything they said it would be. It hardly feels like you are even wearing a bra at all yet it is still very supportive. Easy to nurse. Only negative is if you have the pads in they get all jumbled when you unhook and renouncing sides. You have to readjust them each time.
5	1315872000	Practicality is HUGE, but so is comfort! Super comfortable to where around all day, and obviously it serves it's purpose as well!
5	1315785600	Most comfortable nursing bra I've tried. No underwire yet supports very nicely and makes my chest look like I never even had a baby. :)
5	1315440000	I bought this product while I was pregnant and found it to be very comfortable.  It has worked great for breastfeeding too.  The only struggle I have found is that the removable cups get bunched up while I am breastfeeding, so they have to be repositioned after.  Without the cups, the bra is very thin
5	1315267200	I am currently 8 months pregnant and my 38DD bras were starting to feel way too tight.  Instead of buying up a size in a regular bra I decided to try the switch to a nursing bra.  I am so glad I did.  This bra is so comfortable.  It has no underwire and yet offers enough support so that I can actually wear it out in public.  Also, there are thin pads in the bra (which are removable) which prevent your nipples from showing through.  I love love this bra and am going to order another one.  Yes, it is pricey but it is totally worth it.  I wish I had bought this bra months ago.  By the way, I am probably a 40DD right now and the XL fits me perfectly.  Hopefully it will stretch as my cup size changes during breastfeeding.
5	1315008000	I had planned to just pick up some cheap Target nursing bras for my maternity leave but did splurge and get one of these and it is wonderful! Very comfortable and looks much better under nicer clothes than the cheap ones. Great support. I could only afford one so I got one for during the day esp now that I am back to work, and then use the cheaper, less supportive ones overnight.
5	1315008000	I am nursing my 5th and this bra is so great.  I have owned other Bravados in the past but this bra is super comfortable, flattering and functional.  I am pretty small chested (A-B) and ordered the small.  I am always worried that small nursing sizes will be too big for me but this one fits great all the time.  I would recommend it for anyone who hates underwire bras or too much cup and padding.
5	1315008000	Best nursing bra I have ever had. Love it!  Conceals nursing pads, has great support, and milk ducts don't clog like with underwire bras.
4	1313971200	This is the 3rd time I bought this nursing bra - it's a very comfortable nursing bra and it comes with some padding to prevent leakage. The elastics do wear off after a while especially if you use it often like I do.
5	1313971200	I liked the first one I bought so much that I ordered another one.  I am a major bargain hunter and always try to buy cheap, off-brand stuff....but I finally treated myself to this one nice thing.  IT IS SO WORTH IT.  I nurse like 10 times a day, so I think that I deserve some comfort and good support and this bra totally does it.  Wonderful.  Will never buy another cheap nursing bra ever again.
1	1313884800	I had really high hopes for this bra, given then 4.5+ star reviews on Amazon at the time. Everybody raved how comfortable and great this thing is. Considering it was also in the high-end price range, I thought "OK, you get what you pay for, right?"As it turns out - not always. As soon as I first tried it on I wanted to throw up at the "look" it gave me. But I figured comfort was more important in the first month or two of nursing, so I decided to keep it. I honestly gave it 3 weeks of daily wear - thought I'd get used to it. Nope, sorry.Let me try to list all the things I hate about it:- It is made out of polyester/spandex blend. No natural fibers whatsoever. Which means it is extremely unpleasant on your bare (and might I add super sensitive, considering early breastfeeding days) skin.- It makes you look like a 90 year old grandma who could care less what she looks like. I'm sorry, but I refuse to accept that because I'm nursing I must look like a hippo.- The stretchy bands that are supposed to "hold" you when you unstrap one side to feed over-stretched in a couple days and you are forced to tuck them in. So they are pretty useless at this point.- Who said this was a SEAMLESS bra?? I specifically bought seamless disposable nursing pads, knowing that this is a soft bra, so I didn't want them to show through. Well, what do you know - the pads that come inside of the cups in this bra are far from seamless themselves, and you can, 100% of the time, see the edges of them bubbling up from the bra. No matter how you place them in - they show. So no, this is most definitely not a seamless bra.- The adjustable straps keep going back to the "as stretched as possible" position. I have to re-adjust them once daily. None of my regular bras do that, neither did my old nursing bra from a few years back. Perhaps the material of the straps is too "silky"?- The one-handed straps are a little tougher to unhook with one hand. I usually have to use 2 hands, but I suppose it just needs getting used to.- I paid $50 for this?? I am choosing to wear $16 tanks from Target (also sold here on Amazon) over this over-priced itchy thing. I bet if I go back to Target and buy a cotton nursing bra it will look and feel much better.Girls, don't buy into the hype. This thing is not worth your money. You'll just be frustrated and sick over how much money you spent on it.
2	1313539200	This bra is very high cut under the arm pit.  It also has an elastic band running around the edges of the cup, both in the center of the bra and under the arm pits.  Because my breasts are very full on the top, i.e. not saggy, I found that this elastic chafed under the arm.  My skin would get very irritated.  So, unfortunately, this bra did not work out for me.  I called Bravado customer service and they told me that the Original nursing bra and the Sublime bra do not have this elastic at the edges of the cup.
4	1313539200	This is by far the best nursing bra that I own, even though there are opportunities for improvement.Pros: This bra is super comfortable. The straps don't dig, the cups are soft, and it has the right amount of give & support. I wear a size 38D and purchased a Large on the recommendation of another reviewer. My daughter is 7 weeks old and this bra has fit from her birth throughout my weight loss and still fits perfectly. As others have stated, this is a lower cut bra which means that you can wear it with more shirts. I find that it works better than any of my other bras with my favorite nursing product: Nursing Shirt/Tank By Undercover Mama...they are amazing & turn any nursing bra into a nursing cami...although you can buy those much cheaper elsewhere. The quality of this bra is awesome & will be able to hold up to a year of wear much better than others I have. I didn't have this while pregnant but it would have been perfect for 3rd trimester as well. I wash in the machine on the gentle or hand-wash cycles & hang to dry. Still looks as good as new.Cons: Price. Others have mentioned the nursing pads bunching up. They do but once you use them for a bit you get better at how you pull the nursing cup back up so that they straighten. I'm looking into tacking them in place and I'll let you know how that goes. The only really annoying thing for me is the straps themselves. The part that is left attached to the bra when the cup is folded down is super stretchy which is better for comfort than other bras that have material with little give. However, they are stretchy which makes the hook placement on the strap slide up to the top of your shoulder making it harder to clasp back one-handed.All in all, if you can afford it, I would definitely recommend this bra. The comfort this gives is superior when paired with the level of support.I've even worn this at night and it is much more comfortable than the Medela sleeping ones. I bought the butterscotch and am now purchasing it in white as well. I wish this was around when I had my son. As pricey as they are it would have saved me money in the long run.
5	1313452800	I'm still nursing my 15 month old and i'm 5 months pregnant with number 2. the entire 15 months i've nursed my 15 month old i looked and bought tons of nursing bras. quite a few of them were bravado's as well. never LOVED any. a few i thought were ok but never LOVED one. i wish sooooo badly I had tried this one earlier. it rocks. give me lots of support and even lift! i'm normally a 34D...nursing and prego i'm minimum 36DD if not bigger...this bra pulls them up and makes them looks great and it's so comfy! cannot wait to buy one in ever color! highly recommend. ps...i'm pretty tiny but with huge boobs - i ordered the large and it fits perfect. but i have it on the tightest loop :)
5	1313107200	Love this bra!!! It is the most comfortable bra I've found for nursing (and I've tried several). It is nice & stretchy so it can accommodate your changing figure, and I love that it has removable liners for added protection. The clasps are also very easy to use one handed. Great bra!
5	1312675200	I wanted a nursing bra that was comfortable AND would hold its shape. I went through several others and this is BY FAR the best. It costs more than other bras for sure, but it's worth every penny. I bought it in black and butterscotch. I would definitely recommend these!
2	1312588800	I received this bra as a gift that I listed on my baby registry. I am 9 months pregnant and currently a 40DDD/F. The sizing info says an XL will fit this size. But just like a LOT of the women have said in their reviews, I am falling out of the top and sides of this bra!! Its great for around the house and comfortablr, but in public, I dont want my breasts hanging out of the top!! So I would say if you are a smaller more 'normal' size, its a comfy bra. But dont spend the money if you are large large chested. Glad it was a gift!! I have the Bravado Bliss for 40DDD/F and love it.
2	1312502400	Like the title says, this bra is just not supportive enough for my 34E.  I find it especially uncomfortable to sleep in.  I have been much happier with my Anita underwire, I even sleep in it.
5	1312416000	I have been searching and searching for a nursing bra that is both comfortable and supportive.  Most bras I found were one or the other and I have wasted loads of money on bras from Medela and Motherhood Maternity.  I saw this listed on a website as a top nursing bra, especially for heavier chested women and figured I'd give it a try.  Finally, I have found the comfort and support I have been searching for!  I LOVE THIS BRA!!!!  I will be buying 5-6 more!
5	1312416000	Awesome nursing bra. Tried others and this is the most comfortable. Also, for those embarrassing moments of "leakage", this bra conceals it and only you know it's time to go home to change clothes. Highly recommend it.
5	1312243200	Tried many and failed!!! Until this bra...I love it. Stretchy and comfortable yet supportive. Snaps are so easy to use. Worth every penny....FYI: was a C before baby...now D or more so it's great for all sizes! Good work Bravado!
5	1312070400	these are my favorite nursing bras. they are comfortable and supportive. i especially like that there are inserts that come out -- so you can dry them separately after a wash. i also like that they look kind of like a cami under nursing tops that are cut low.the only downside is these bras are pretty expensive! but to me, they are worth it.
5	1311811200	I am only 20 weeks pregnant, but I have already grown 3 cup sizes and I know I will only get bigger! I wanted to invest in a good nursing bra so I could use it longer. All of the other bras I tried weren't quite the right fit for the shape of my breast. The soft cup in this bra forms around the breast making it a perfect fit. And there are no underwires or hard boning/seams poking into my sides. The fabric is very breathable too! I think I might need to buy a few more.
5	1311811200	As odd as it may seem to some people, I purchased this bra and I am NOT nursing or expecting... My children are in their teens and I am not having any more. BUT, I have RA and fibromyalgia and it is really hard for me to find a bra that doesn't rub me the wrong way... literally. My skin is really sensitive and I cannot do underwires. However, I am a 42E, so I can't just wear any microfiber bra and I DEFINITELY cannot go WITHOUT a bra.This bra appealed to me because it is a seamless microfiber stretch and has a wide band all the way around. I was hesitant to buy online without trying on, but decided to go for it because the bras that I have been wearing are cheap, all cotton, uni-boob sports bras... and they are not comfortable or even remotely attractive.I ordered the XL and when the bra arrived, I tried it on right away. It is really comfortable and surprisingly supportive. I gave it 5 stars because it really is a really great bra and my gripes about it are fairly trivial.Negatives:-the straps are a little thin for heavy breasts... they dig a little and have no cushioning.-the band does get a little bunched up on the sides when I'm sitting (but most bras probably would since I have a bit of a spare tire/muffin top thing going on). I was tugging and pulling a bit to keep the band flattened against my skin -- please remember that I have super sensitive skin and any pulling, bunching, rubbing irritates me, so this may not be a problem for you.Positives:-it doesn't look like a nursing bra! (My husband didn't even notice, until he found the *ahem* easy-access/one-handed-operation clips! -- I could go on about that, but it would put this bra into a whole other category!)-stretch band is wide and offers support-super duper uber soft against my skin-adjustable hook/eye back closure-adjustable straps-has removable breast pads-easy clip for nursing (even though I am not nursing, the clip is easy to use)Overall, I am very happy with this bra and ordered a second one. I am still looking for other soft, supportive, wire-free bras... it is an exhaustive search, but I'm confident that there is a "perfect bra" somewhere out there for me. If you have found the magical bra of all bras for bigger girls, I would love to hear about it!! Thanks  :)
4	1311638400	I bought one of these at a hospital lactation center initially and was thrilled with the support (for a wireless bra) and the comfort.  Bought a second one from amazon later.  It's now my go to bra.  My only complaint is that sometimes with full breasts I really just need more support but I'm a 36DD and that may be too much to ask from a bra w/o underwires.
4	1311638400	I'm exclusively breastfeeding my third baby now, so I've been through quite a few nursing bras from all the major manufacturers. This is my favorite one for how I look in it, but it's my least favorite for how it snaps. I love how I could just order a medium and have it cover me through the changes of maternity and pregnancy, but I probably wouldn't use it much when I had a newborn who nursed all the time, because it's impossible to snap with just one hand. The reason for this is that it has no sling-type fabric under the cup that supports your breast while breastfeeding. It just has a little ribbon of elastic that runs down the sides of the bra for you to clip the cup fabric to. Since there's nothing to keep the bra strap in place while you nurse, you have to reach back behind your shoulder to pull your bra strap forward so you can clip the cup closed. That said, it's very comfortable otherwise and has the lowest V neckline of any of my nursing bras.
5	1311552000	I am extremely pleased with this nursing bra and wish I had ordered it earlier.  It is very comfortable, but still provides support and coverage.
5	1311292800	I tried several other nursing bras before buying this one. It may be more expensive but it's the most functional and most comfortable nursing bra out there. (In fact, I may end up wearing it even after stopping breastfeeding) It comes with padding that you can take out if you don't want it. It's sturdy, soft and discreet. I liked it so much that I ended up getting two more.
5	1311120000	This is by far the best nursing bra I have tried. The flexible fabric and design is perfect for a breastfeeding mom; it accommodates natural variation in cup size, it allows for easy access (unlike some padded bras which are difficult to fold down), and it is extremely comfortable. If you are wondering about sizing, I found the small to be a perfect fit for me; I was a 34A before pregnancy and have worn 36B/C during pregnancy and since.
4	1310688000	The fabric of this bra is very comfortable and does not lose shape with washing.  I like the removable liner, but with the nursing pads, it's not really necessary.  I actually prefer the "Stella" bra by the same company, but it's not available online or in black.  I think the fit for this bra runs true to size, but I have also always been on the small side of bras in general (pre-pregnancy bra size was 32B), but when my breasts are full just prior to feeding/pumping, I fill out the bra even without the liner.
4	1310515200	This is the only bra I have found that fits around my chest. I was shopping for a 40DD and the XL works perfectly for this size. The bra is very comfortable, but I have a hard time re-clasping it with one hand after feeding. Also, the pads inside are a pain to fix after each washing. Overall, a great bra.
5	1310428800	This is the best nursing bra I've ever owned!  It gives wonderful support without being too thick and ugly.  The shape I get from wearing the bra looks like me, but more polished.  And believe me, if you are nursing a baby 24-7, being a little more polished really makes you feel human again. This is a very soft and figure hugging bra.  It gives great support while being able to accomodate the engorgement days without a problem.  I imagine it will be great for a maternity bra as well, since it handles a slight change in size perfectly.  I love this bra also because I don't like nursing bras with padding and a rigid shape to it.  So with that said, this is a great everyday nursing bra if you don't like padding in the bra.  Since the bra cup is so soft, the padding insert that came with the bra shows at the edges, and are clearly visible under a shirt.  I don't plan on using the inserts since I am perfectly happy with not having them, but if you like a little padding, know that the inserts will most likely not work for you.  Love this comfortable, beautiful bra, highly recommend it.
5	1310342400	I purchased so many wireless bras, but this one got it right!! I wore my last month of pregnancy too, and it's so light! It's expensive but worth the investment, I purchased so many I had to throw out. I'm a 38C and ordered the L, fits perfectly.
3	1310083200	Nice quality, but the cut makes it hard to use nursing pads. Very messy for sleeping on your side. I paid more for this bra than any other nursing bra I own, and it's the most limited in usefulness.
5	1309824000	I really, really like my Bravado! bras for several reasons: 1.) They are comfortable, and don't make those extra baby pounds I haven't lost yet pinch on my back (you know what I mean)! 2.) The front latches can be fastened one-handed, which is very useful when you are holding your baby with the other hand. 3.) The customer service is awesome! One of mine started unraveling on the strap after a few weeks, and I contacted Bravado! about it. They replaced it for free, no questions asked. They are expensive, but the way I see it, if you're going to breastfeed you are making an investment in your child, and you want to take care of that investment as best you can. Breastfeeding is hard enough without having uncomfortable support!
5	1309824000	Comfortable and supportive.  Looks great under smooth / formfitting clothes (the included pads are great).  Washes easily and dries quickly.  A great everyday bra for nursing moms--I'll be ordering one in black, too.
5	1309824000	I am in LOVE with this bra! It is so comfortable I am even going to wear it through the last few weeks of my pregnancy! It is soft and stretchy but still supportive and doesn't cause any weird uncomfortableness like every other bra out there (especially nursing bras!). I love it so much I am ordering it in every color! I will use them for my day bra's and I will use my sleep bras at night (although this is comfortable enough to sleep in!) I usually insist on having an underwire bra and think that sports bras give me no shape and this looks and feels similar to a sports bra but something about it makes it look like you are wearing a much more shapely supportive bra. This is great for mommies...a must have product!
2	1309219200	I am 8 months pregnant and my current size is a little greater than 36 B. So, I ordered size M. I have the rib band on the biggest size. I could not fit in anything smaller (so S would not have worked). But the cups are looser than I would have liked.I don't like the look without the removable pads - too loose and not discrete. I do not like the removable pads either - they slide around and their shape shows under clothing.I am sure there are women for whom this bra is a perfect fit. For me buying bras in a store where I can try them on is a better idea. I usually have to try up to 10 bras before I find a good fit.The quality seems to be good though.
5	1308873600	This nursing bra is super comfortable and easy to undo and do up.  It has made nursing so much easier and better.  I bought another one because I liked the first one so much.  My only complaint is that I couldn't get it in white.  It is even comfortable to sleep in.
4	1308700800	I ordered this bra when my friend recommended it. It's so comfortable, and is very supportive. I'm not sure what size I am now that I'm nursing, but I'm bigger than a DD, and the size large fits great. My one complaint, is it does give me a uni-boob look, but I'll take it for such comfy support!
5	1308614400	I've tried several different nursing bras and this is hands down the best.  It offers good support (as good as you can get without an underwire), is truly comfortable, and when the included pads are used, prevents any nipple show through.  Highly recommend.
5	1308355200	I know these seem kinda pricey but they are worth every penny! They are comfy through pregnancy, work fantastic for nursing and last forever. Seriously. I went through some junky nursing bras, spent some money on these and lived in these when I was nursing my daughter. Now, I am pregnant with twins, ordering more and have started wearing those same bras I wore to nurse my daughter (they are so comfy!). I'd definitely give them a try. I was a 34DD when nursing and a M worked well for me. I just ordered a large b/c I got pretty big with my last baby and I am pregnant with twins, it seems to already fit great, and will likely grow nicely with me, unlike most bras.
4	1308268800	I am a 36B and I love this bra. I tried a few cheaper nursing bras and they just didn't cut it. This is comfortable, supportive and I love the fact that it looks like a cami under low-cut shirts.  It is worth the price for sure!  I took out the padding because it was a bit too much and I am really happy with it.  Only problem is that the hook can sometimes be tricky to re-attach.  When it is unhooked there is just a little ribbon that goes on the side, so it can be tricky to find the clasp again and do it with just one hand.  I like the fact that there isn't a goofy circle like some nursing bras because it can be hard to position the breast correctly and any extra fabric just gets in the way of my hungry baby!Worth the money for sure!
5	1308009600	This nursing bra fits true to size and is VERY comfortable.  I have been looking since I had my first child (now have a second) for a nursing bra that I really like. After trying many bras, I finally ordered this from Amazon and don't know what took me so long to try it!  It is wireless and soft and I can even wear it with my v-neck tops.  I highly recommend this one!
5	1307923200	I already had 2 of these bras from my first child but wanted one more since I live in them! They are so comfortable and soft. A must have! Even if you aren't nursing. I strictly pump but I LOVE these bras! Totally worth the money! You won't be disappointed!
3	1307750400	I tried on this bra and LOVED how comfortable it was, so I bought it. I wore it for a little while and loved it so much I bought another one. THEN, on the third time through the wash the cup seams came apart. I still had the second one, so I continued to use it. THEN on the THIRD time through the wash for the second one (yes, the third time AGAIN) the cup seams came apart.I love how comfortable the bra is so much that I spent the time to mend both bras rather than return them. BUT, I would not purchase them again.
5	1307577600	Wow this bra is fantastic!  I'm 7.5 months pregnant and haven't found a bra that has felt so comfortable!!  It's supportive without digging in or bulging under my clothes.  So glad I gave this one a try, am sure it'll be just as fantastic when I start to nurse our LO!Definitely getting one in every color!
4	1306454400	I really like the shape and feel of this bra. Feels like it will hold everything in nicely and gives me a nice shape and cleavage which is pretty hard to find in my size. Pre-pregnancy I was a 38 DD now that I am 8 months pregnant I am a 42DDD - I have no fathom how big I will get when I am nursing. I ordered based off their size guide and got a 1X which fits really well right now, there is absolutely no room for growth though and imagine I will have to order another bigger size for when the baby is actually born - little dissapointing but I like it enough that I will order the same one, only bigger.
2	1306281600	I have used the original cotton Bravado bras and nursing tanks with my first two children and absolutely loved them.  Now 34 weeks pregnant with my third, I came back to find that Bravado now makes a nice array of bras for nursing moms.  After reading the reviews, I decided that the Bodysilk Seamless seemed divine.  To be fair, it IS a very comfortable, supportive bra.  However, the molded cup inserts do NOT stay put, look hideously unnatural and tend to look "bumpy" under clothing.  Furthermore, in the ivory color, the inserts appear to be two large, very visible circles under any light colored shirt.  I tried replacing those with nursing pads and had the same problem.  I'm now out big bucks for a poorly designed bra.  The darker colors might be better, but I'd stay FAR away from the lighter hued bras in this style.
5	1306195200	This time, I actually came onto my account looking for this item to review, when usually I am prompted several times by an Amazon email to do so.  This is hands down the best bra I've ever owned.  I am very picky about the fit/material/support of undergarments.  I never buy these things online because I am not able to try them on.  I was definitely skeptical when I decided to purchase this. This material will fit to anyone's shape/size and it is so supportive and comfortable.  It provides a lot of support but still gives you room to breathe.  I am tempted to continue wearing it after I am finished breastfeeding!  Definitely worth the money...and you may want to get more than one.  I am a 34 D and ordered a medium.  If I were a little smaller or larger, this bra would still fit, though, due to the adjustable straps and buckle.
2	1306195200	I purchased this bra based on all the great reviews.  Unfortunately, I should have heeded the advice for larger sizes.  I'm currently wearing a 40F nursing bra (38D pre-pregnancy, 40E during pregnancy) and I am completely popping out of the top of this bra.  I ordered the XL and it should fit based on the size chart on the package.  I'm disappointed.  I'm still wearing it occasionally but only with a tank top to smooth things out.  I gave it 2 stars because I do like the fabric and details.  I've decided my best bet is just to try on bras at Motherhood.  They do actually carry these larger sizes.
5	1306108800	I bought this bra while 36 weeks pregnant with my 3rd child and as soon as I put it on I wanted to cry with relief! It's SO comfortable and I am thrilled. I wore the Bravado "Original" style while nursing my first 2 children but always felt like it gave me a "uniboob" appearance! This one actually gives some shape without being an underwire.For nursing, it has been excellent. It allows for room when you're engorged in those early days but hasn't become stretched out yet. I was a 42D pre-nursing and went with an XL. There was plenty of support but no binding with this one.I have VERY sensitive skin during pregnancy and always end up with rashes under my breasts from irritation. This bra is so soft, breathable, and gentle on sensitive skin that I wish I had bought it earlier. I am back to buy more because I'll be wearing this for the rest of the time I nurse baby #3!
5	1306108800	This is the most comfortable nursing bra I've ever worn!  I'm on my second baby and wanted something comfy yet functional for nursing.  This bra is very supportive and looks great under clothing (no weird lumps or wrinkles in the material) and is also thick enough (with removable liners)to provide a nice shape and hide nursing pads.  Great for sleeping in. I ordered three of these!  Well worth the price.
4	1305849600	I have several nursing bras and this one is my favorite. It's so comfy because it molds to your skin and you forget that you're wearing a bra. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because you can see your nursing pads through the bra when wearing solid colored tops. To avoid this, I just wear tops with patterns or prints when I wear this bra. It's a bit expensive but worth the money for the comfort. It's hard enough being a new mom without being uncomfortable!
5	1305590400	As soon as I put this on I loved it!  It is the most comfortable nursing bra I've had (out of 4 kids and one on the way).  I did not know that the padding came out, which is an added bonus!  The extra padding in the cup helps hide the disposable nursing pads.  The bra is very soft.  I don't need to wear it yet as I am still pregnant but I will wear it just because it is so comfortable! I am normally a 38D and so I ordered the extra large, it fits perfect.
5	1305244800	This is the most comfortable bra I have ever put on.  I was having the hardest time keeping up with my growing chest during my pregnancy and finding bras that not only fit, but that were comfortable.  I love this bra.  I wear a 36E so I bought the large and it fits perfectly.  I went back and ordered a black one too.  I'm going to have a hard time going back to my regular bras after nursing.  I highly recommend this bra.
3	1305072000	The first thing I need to say about this bra is that the "soft cups" are a joke. They are smaller than the bra cup so they look like headlights under your shirt. Thankfully, they can be removed. Without the pads, it is a pretty good bra, definitely looks seamless. Major uniboob though.Very supportive band and straps.I ordered the nude, but should have gotten the black because it is pretty high and peeks out of some shirts.
3	1305072000	This was my first nursing bra and I was happy to find one that fit me.  I am a 34DDD(F/G) and this seemed to work well, especially for engorgement.  I took the pads out because when engorged it was just more pressure and they left round indentations on my breast. I would definately still use this bra for the beginning stages of nursing. HOWEVER, this bra did NOT lift the girls up well at all.  They are pretty heavy (already heavy for thier size, 34C, pre-pregnancy) and they always looked like they sagged.  I learned not all big sizes are heavy during a comparison with my sister who is a 36 D.  Hers were much lighter than mine.  I think it has something to do with dense breast tissue.  Anyway, when it came to buying clothes again, I was depressed because I couldn't find ANY shirts that fit me.  Even if they fit around my waist, my breast would weigh the shirt down and the shirt would dig into the back of my neck.  For 4 months I just assumed my breast were too big for regular clothes so I still wore my maternity clothes(they only feel cute when you are actually pregnant). While I was in the mall one day I decided to go into a plus size store to see if they would have any flattering shirts that would fit me.  I ended up trying on a 36DDD bra and I was so happy to find that it actually lifted and separated my breast!I put my shirt on over it and it looked so much better!  Even though it was not a nursing bra, it gave me hope that there was something out there that could give me better support.  I still use my nursing cami, though not the best support, still better than this one.  When I find the perfect nursing bra that looks good with regular clothes, I will definately update this review.ALSO:  This bra does not mush them together, but doesn't separate well either.  And it definately doesn't work well with deep v-neck shirts.
5	1304985600	I have tried many nursing bras now and its hard to find both comfy and supportive. I'm a 34DD and wear the medium bra. It holds me up and look great under all tops. I just purchased a second one so I don't have to wash this one every day! Also works great with the Medela Freestyle handsfree pump (which i'm also obsessed with.)
5	1304812800	The bra itself is very comfortable, as far as sizing goes I'm a 36C and a medium fits great. I haven't had my baby yet, so I can't comment on how it works out for nuring yet, but I think it will be perfect. When it arrived, the pads had been creased in the mail. I called the company (figure8) to see if there was a way to get the creases out. They were extremely nice and apologetic and said they were sending me a new pair that day. I was very impressed by their customer service and can't wait to use this product!
4	1304640000	I am still pregnant so not breastfeeding yet, but this bra has been very comfortable and appears that it will function easily once I am breastfeeding.  There is one thing I do not like about it though.  The product description lists foam-lined cups for modesty, which is a key feature I was looking for since I am wearing this pre-breastfeeding and with no nursing pads.  The foam pads are removable inserts, which doesn't bother me at all, but the inserts are cut to a smaller size than the overall cup size so you can see their outline if you are wearing a more form-fitting or lighter colored shirt.  It just looks funny.  The pads are thick enough to be 'modest' for the purpose intended, but when you see the bump and outline of the pad through your shirt it doesn't feel so modest anymore.Otherwise I am pleased with this bra.  It is comfortable and supportive and constructed in a way that doesn't give a lumpy appearance at the back like many bras will.  I would definitely recommend it to others, just with the knowledge that you can only wear it under looser fitting or darker colored shirts.
4	1304467200	This nursing bra is by far the most comfortable that I've tried - and I've tried plenty!  It's very soft but offers great support.  The functionality is quick and easy and the shoulder straps are fairly thin.  I will often end up sleeping in this nursing bra instead of changing in to the my actual sleeping bra, it's that comfortable!  It's a little bit more expensive but well worth it!
5	1304294400	I love this Bravado nursing bra so much I wear it every day. This is my second bra from them and you just can`t beat the quality. Although it is a nursing bra I have been wearing it through my pregnancy. So comfortable and I bought another one. Highly recommend. I do think this is the best bra on the market.
2	1303862400	After reading all the other reviews I thought there is no way I could go wrong buying this bra.  I knew it was expensive but I figured it would be worth it.  Well, once I got it I realized it doesn't work for me.  I ended up with a uniboob which is what I didn't want.  The material is nice but it doesn't give any support or separation.  I am going to stick with my $10 Bestform nursing bra from Walmart instead.
5	1303603200	I was hesitant to order on-line since one never knows how a bra will work until you try it on. This bra is worth every cent! I'm 31 weeks pregnant and still nursing our 2 1/2 year old. I desperately needed a new bra to accommodate a growing chest, much to my dismay. With our first child I had a Bravado but it was highly unattractive and looked like a tube top. I purchased it in Canada where we lived at the time and was told this would be the only style which came in my size there (a 32C NOT pregnant and a 34E when pregnant). Needless to say I was not happy. And about the only thing you can get from Amazon in Canada are books. Because I still have almost 10 weeks to go and know from experience that the first few days after having a baby one is bigger than imagination could ever go, I ordered a M. I have it on one of the tighter hooks and it is giving me a little room to grow still. Because with my first child, I decreased back to a 32 D within 4-6 weeks and stayed there (because I was nursing) I only ordered one. Once I have the baby, I'll see where I'm at and possibly order a couple of Smalls if my body responds similarly. For those who are hesitant to pay this much for a bra, truly, you cannot go wrong. They are high quality and will last! Simply get 2 to rotate between and hang dry them. You will not be disappointed.
5	1303344000	I have had this bra now for about 2 weeks and it is so comfortable.  I am currently 8 months pregnant so i have not used it for nursing but I have nursed before and wish i had this with my first baby.  I also like that this bra will accomodate changes in size and will grow with you. It is a bit pricier than what you can pickup at some local stores but definetely worth the money.  I am looking into getting another one.
4	1303344000	My friend recommended this bra to me, and I really like it.  It's more like wearing a sports bra (which I'm very used to wearing being an athlete).  The fabric is stretchy and moves really well with you and your breasts (as they fill up/empty).  I bought the black one in a size small (I'm a 34B normally) and it fit almost perfectly.  I had to remove the pads to allow more room for full breasts (more comfortable).  One complaint is that the snaps are really high up on the straps, so when you're trying to hook (or unhook) with one hand (baby in the other) it can be difficult to reach.  Probably not a big complaint, but I thought it was worth mentioning.  I could probably adjust the straps, but then the bra would be saggy.  So. All in all, I really like this product!
4	1303084800	Ivory discolors fast, but I do wear this bra all the time. Biggest flaw is by far the random strap that's way too long when you snap the bra back up. I don't know if that makes sense, but when you unhook the flap, the strap is still on your shoulder, and it's a stupid design.. but most nursing bras have it.
1	1303084800	This offers NO support. (Photos truly can be deceiving). The pads are very hard to get in/out. They are small and thin, so it is very hard to get it situated right without having top part stick out through bra. When you pull down to nurse the pad bunches (folds up) and when you pull to re-attach you have to reposition pad. This is assuming you catch it right then, otherwise its embarrassing to have someone else point out that you have a lumpy spot in your bra area. Makes you look like you stuffed your bra for those that are not aware that you are nursing. lmao. Not really. For the price, its a rip off. You are better to buy a good supportive sports bra. The Bravado bra's cut literally cuts into your armpit under your arm. The clasps are hard to do one handed, so you have to yous two hands. One to hold strap and one to re-clasp. That being said, it is reversed to tighten the strap bands. Instead of pulling the back band up (where you have more slack), you are only pulling the front strap up; which ends up being very uncomfortable and only allowing very little to tighten shoulder strap. I'm tall and this still was a huge problem. I really wish I could return this product, but can't because of hygiene reasons. Understandable, but this is going to be thrown in the garbage. All for $45 wasted. I should at least get refund, but for what? They cannot sell this again. Pun intended.
4	1303084800	I'm a 30C....try finding THAT in a nursing bra! It's very difficult, let me tell you...I have very few choices. None in local stores so I've had to order everything online, mostly from the UK....and since every bra fits differently, it's been frustrating. One of my friends suggested this bra...she raved about the comfort of it and suggested that maybe the size S would work for me. Amazingly this one worked pretty well. It IS very comfortable. Ideally there would be one tighter clasp in back for me to get it a little tighter across the band, but the tightest setting does the job. Hopefully this won't stretch too much and make that an issue. The only complaint I have is regarding the removable cups...I wish this bra was constructed with the cups NOT removable...they shift around a lot during a nursing session and often times I have to readjust them to get them into the proper position afterwards. As other reviewers have mentioned, you can see the outline of the entire cup through the bra. For me, this hasn't been an issue because it's been winter (and a cold spring) so I'm still wearing layers. However, when I just have my tank on, you can see the outline of the cups. It remains to be seen once summer hits how I will feel about that. But, for me being a 30C....this was one of my last hopes and it fit better than most!
5	1302652800	After trying 6 other bras, I think this is the "it" nursing bra for me. I am a 32D and got the small.- Microfiber construction gives me the "lift" I want (cotton doesn't cut it)- No underwire discomfort (and don't seem to need the underwire for lift or support)- Removable somewhat molded cup pads hide nipples, but are flexible enough that they aren't in the way when I put the whole cup down for nursing or pumpingI also own the "basics by bravado" version of this bra (the "Stella" I think) that was sold at Target. I liked that one too, it has fewer features but made from the same cut and similar fabric.  Too bad I can't find it anymore.
5	1302480000	I just received this last week. I haven't actually used it for nursing yet (baby's not here yet), but so far, I really like it. The bra fits well. I ordered a size Large. I was a 36B before pregnancy, but now I'm more like a 38D. It also is easy to unhook and seems like it will be functional for breast feeding. Also, for a non-underwire, it is very stable and supportive (which I was concerned about). And, the color is nice and the fabric is soft and feels good on my skin. Plus, as others have said, it's not cut too high in the front and doesn't show out the top of shirts. It was expensive, but I think it will be worth it!
5	1302307200	It's really comfortable, the material is really soft and it isn't too tight like regular bras. It also looks attractive and can be used as a regular bra even when you're not breastfeeding.
4	1302134400	I'm 8 months pregnant and underwired bras just don't agree with me anymore. I've tried an assortment of wired and wireless bras, breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding bras, and this is the most comfortable one I have tried so far.The material is very soft and comfortable, and the removable pads don't show enough under clothing for me to be concerned or annoyed. the shoulder straps could be a bit wider for more support, but since I'm a C cup right now  it's not too much of an issue. The bands that go around my torso are nice and wide, which I love. It is very comfortable and don't create rolls on my back and sides like conventional bras do.The only complaint I have with this bra is that the material under my boobs curl up and make wearing this a little less comfortable. But that is not the manufacturer's fault, there's just not much room between my boobs and my belly. We'll see if the problem gets fixed after birth.I am about a 42 C right now, and size "L" works perfect for me.
1	1301875200	I have tried this bra on many times, I bought one for my first baby 4 years ago and it was the most uncomfortable bra I had. I tried it again this time, and same thing. The straps are itchy and the plastic pokes. Maybe I was sent the wrong bra, because the fabric was not soft or comfortable. I sent it back right away.
1	1301702400	Very comfortable, but the straps broke after washing it once and I had to throw it away! Don't waste your money, poorly sewn together.
5	1301529600	After upsizing my bras twice during pregnancy, with no luck - I started searching reviews for a great alternative. Every bra I had tried - the most expensive to the least - was uncomfortably digging into the skin between my busom and very high pregnant belly, leaving marks that would last days. I thought this was a little pricey for a temporary "nursing bra," but decided to give it a shot after reading good reviews - besides, I was desperate! I'm so very glad that I took the chance. The removable soft pads are just enough to keep me from having the "headlights" look in fitted shirts, and it also prevents the dreaded back bulges with its smooth, seamless design. The support is amazing, something I didn't think would be possible without underwire. My chest looks good even in the clingiest of maternity t-shirts. I've practiced clasping and unclasping the straps for nursing my baby due in May, and it's very easy. I liked it so much that I bought two: black and butterscotch (nude), and plan to continue wearing them (even after I'm done nursing).
1	1301270400	I ordered the XL which I thought would be large enough, but it was too small in the band, and much too small in the cups. There isn't as much stretch or "give" in the cups as I expected. The foam pad in one of the cups was folded in half and creased, and it made an awful-looking bulge on the cup. It could be used without the foam pads, as they are removable, but then there would be leakage and nipple show-through, as the cups are a very thin material. And the company doesn't accept returns of nursing bras! I should have checked their return policy before I bought it, of course. But now I'm stuck with a bra that I'll never be able to wear. Waste of money. Very disappointed.
4	1301097600	I am large busted with a small band size and when I got pregnant these were the only bras that fit. I bought one size early on in my pregnancy and towards the end I bought the next size up to wear while breastfeeding. They are so comfortable and really do remain comfortable when you size changes due to milk supply fluctuations. The removable molded cups are a bit of a pain as they always come out in the wash and have to be repositioned/reinserted, but they do provide a nice smooth shape. Most of the time I just leave them out though since most of my nursing tops are multi-layered and my nursing pads can't be seen anyway. The only issue I have is that the corners on the strap are very high and show under several of my cute shirts (especially my tanks) that didn't have this problem with other bras. I wish the cup could be a little shorter so that this bra would work with more shirts. I do have a couple of other bras that fit and work better under certain shirts, but they aren't nearly as comfortable. I have 4 of these and wear them every single day!
5	1300924800	I purchased this bra shortly before my second pregnancy.  I had only used nursing bras with my first after having my son and sooo wish I had this one and wish I had worn it through pregnancy.  This time around, I started to wear this bra as soon as my regular bras became uncomfortable with all the fun changes that start in pregnancy and it has made a WORLD of difference.  The cup is supposed to stretch a full cup size (maybe more?!).  I typically need pretty good support in a bra and I always wear underwire, but know that isn't best for nursing especially.  This bra is very supportive, very soft and comfortable, and doesn't shift around with movement like other EXPENSIVE nursing bras I have had that caused painful chafing too.  Although I haven't worn it long yet, I know I will LOVE it.  I am so glad I prepared by buying 2 in advance... contemplating buying more to be ready when the need really increases later this year!THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST!!!
5	1300665600	I'm hugely pleased with this bra, so much so that I ordered more once I'd had the chance to try the first one out.The fabric is soft and so comfortable, yet thick and durable. There are extra pads you can insert into the bra for added coverage but I find them unnecessary even when wearing thick breast pads. The snaps that allow the breast panels to lower for feeding have held up wonderfully, even though at first I was worried they would break. I think their design is perfect, making it quick and easy to get started during a feeding. The strap stays in place even when the breast panels are lowered which is a nice touch, I've had other nursing bras that just allow the strap to fall back behind you where it's hard and awkward to reach - this is especially important when you're breastfeeding in public.I am more busty than most women yet I find this bra provides great support, especially considering it does not have underwire. It is still comfortable enough to wear even when lounging or even sleeping.I prefer the butterscotch color as it does not show up under light colored tops.Very happy I found this nursing bra! I definitely recommend to nursing mothers who prefer comfort but need support.
5	1300406400	I'm a cheapskate and balked at the price of this bra, but the reviews were so good, and my existing nursing bras so bad, that I took the plunge. While nursing I'm a 40F (38 DDD usually), and the XL has been amazing! It's so comfortable and yet so sturdy that I was able to wear it to work before the baby was born, and am able to wear it out of the house now that I'm nursing and on leave. It does not have an underwire, and I haven't left the house without an underwire since I was 13, so believe me, the fact that I'll wear this bra out of the house is really saying something! Great bra, don't be cheap, buy this awesome nursing bra!
5	1300406400	I bought this as a friend recommended it and am really happy with the purchase.  Have worn it loads and it washed great
3	1300233600	After reading all of the reviews, I was really excited for this bra to arrive in the mail. Sadly, when I tried it on for the first time, I was disappointed by the fit. I wish the bra could be ordered by band and cup size, instead of small, medium, large, extra large. I am a 38DD, so I ordered the large, according to their sizing chart. The band fits well (even a little big), but the cups are too small, leaving me spilling out the sides and top of the cups. I love the lined cups and think they would offer great shaping and nipple coverage, if only I can find the right size.
4	1299974400	I really like this nursing bra for using at home or wearing under loose fitting t-shirts, but I haven't been wearing it out.  I took out the liners because they gave me a weird shape, but without them the bra is too thin to hide nursing pads.  It is very comfortable and soft and I'm very pleased with it otherwise!
4	1299628800	Most of the nursing bras I have tried are very uncomfortable.  I am very busty.  It could stand to be more supportive, but overall it is a good nursing bra!
5	1299542400	finally, after extensive search, the ultimate nursing bra. first, it's the most comfy bra i ever had, nursing or not.it has very good support and gives a nice smooth curve on the chest area. the wide straps on the back and sides are great for comfort and support, and i dont have to worry about the back part sliding upwards, wich happens especially when the breasts become bigger and heavier . the fit is very good.  by all means, this bra is Bravado's best ever! a must have for every momand mom to be and i'm convinced i'll continue to wear it after i stop nursing.2 months after : extremely happy with this bra! top quality, great endurance. thank you Bravado!
5	1299196800	I can't begin to say how pleased I am with this bra.  I have tried and returned probably every other brand out there and could not even keep on.  The Bravado bra is made of a lovely supportive forgiving fabric that will grow with you from late pregnancy right thru your nursing transition period and far beyond.  It's so comfy I don't want to take it off.The only issue I had with this brand is that they were a little pricey but so well worth it...I'd rather have a few bras that I can actually wear than 4 or 5 that I'm miserable in.
5	1299110400	I love this bra.  After balking at the price (knowing I'd wear this bra for a limited amount of time) I bought less expensive bras.  Well, you get what you pay for.  After many days and nights dealing with pinching, poking, inflexible fabric, and general ill fit, I broke down and bought one of these bras.  Then another, and now a third.  I LOVE this bra!  It is super comfortable, supportive, and seamless under clothes.  The bra fits whether you've just nursed or haven't in hours (fluctuation in size throughout the day made most other bras super uncomfortable).  The pads are a bit awkward as they don't fill the cups completely, so they have to be adjusted, but that is a minor glitch in an otherwise great design.  I'm now back at work and still exclusively breastfeeding, pumping 3-4 times each workday.  This bra allows for easy access yet still looks like a "regular" bra under clothing.  Highly recommended!!
5	1298851200	Wow, this bra really is amazing! I have yet to use it to nurse but I don't see there being any issues. It may take a bit of practice to undo one handed, but that's alright by me. I was very skeptical about the support this bra would give. I have several other nursing bras and all they were good for was holding a nursing pad in place. Most didn't even look as though I was even wearing a bra! However, this bra is extremely comfortable and gives great lift and shape. I figured I would take the inserts out because I'm always trying to minimize the size of my chest but the inserts actually provide great structure and shape. I ordered a size large and am currently measuring a 38 E/F. The fit is great. I would definitely recommend this bra and plan on buying at least one more. Honestly, you can never have enough nursing bras because you pretty much end up wearing them day and night.
5	1298851200	This is my favorite nursing bra- very comfy and easy to use (clasp can be easily released and latched with one hand).
5	1298678400	I wish that I hadn't wasted money on several other cheaper nursing bras, because this by far the most comfortable, well-made, and functional nursing bra I own.  The band is wide and doesn't roll up or constrict (which is great if you have a tendency to get plugged ducts), and the microfiber material stretches nicely while still being very supportive.  I like the cup inserts as well- they give me a nice shape and help to conceal nursing pads.  The main thing that I love about this bra is that it gives me some "lift", which is a major self-esteem helper if you have a postpartum body (I found that other bras made me look saggy and heavier than I really was).  If you're up to spending the money, buy this bra- you won't regret it.
5	1298678400	Tried a ton of different nursing bras. Hated pretty much all of the ones from brick and mortar maternity stores so I turned to the internet. Super comfortable bra with decent support. I'm a 36DD while nursing and could use a little more lift but with no underwire this is as good as I've gotten. I really love the material of this bra and love that it doesn't cut into my back creating rolls through my shirts. I've bought 2 so far and will buy more.
5	1298332800	I'm a 44D and this bra is by far the most comfortable nursing bra. I'm nursing twins and the drop-down cups are a must. The removable pads are nice too. I've even slept in this bra because it's so comfortable.  I got the Berry Burst color, which is just fun!  I'm used to underwire bras, but this bra is just as supportive.
5	1298073600	I ordered this bra as a gift for my pregnant daughter-in-law (she's due in a month). She absolutely LOVES it--says it's extremely comfortable and very supportive. She's a 42B/C and the XL was a good fit.
5	1297987200	I really like this nursing bra.  I normally wear 38C or 36D now that I am nursing and I got a Medium.  The bra fits great and provides great support.  I like this bra so much I am ordering a second one.
4	1297900800	When I bought this bra online I was a little worried about the fit. I ordered a M for size 36D. Right now that bra fits perfect and I love it. It's very comfortable, supportive and it seems to be made of good quality. Right now I'm only nursing a toddler but my baby will be born in the next two weeks and my milk production will be increasing by a lot. I have rib band set on the last hook (biggest size )and I am afraid that it might not fit as good after baby comes (but I will be loosing weight, so hopefully it will fit even better). The only problem I have is that after wearing it all day, the rib band left red marks on my skin. However I didn't feel any discomfort at all. Overall it's a great bra and I glad that I bought it.Here are the sizes off of the packaging:rib band---cup size-----------B  C  D  E(DD)  F(DDD)32---------S  S  S  S  M34---------S  S  M  M  M36---------S  M  M  L  L38---------M  M  M  L  L40---------M  M  L  L  XL42---------L  L  L  XL  XL44---------L  L  L  XL  XL46---------L  XL XL XL  XL
4	1297641600	After trying many nursing bras, trying to avoid the underwire-this is the best I've found and well worth the money.  Probably best not to wash/dry in machine as it damages the fasteners.  Not truly seamless but super supportive and very easy to nurse.  After nursing both kids for nearly four years, this is all I wear.
5	1297209600	This bra is super comfortable!  It fits just as advertised & is so smooth against my skin.  There are breast shells in the bra for added nipple coverage.  The straps are very comfortable & don't slide off the shoulder if adjusted correctly.  I just started wearing it, so the clips are a little tough to do one-handed right now.  I feel once I break it in, the clips will be easier to undo for nursing sessions.
5	1297209600	This nursing bra is so comfortable and has a perfect fit. The removable pads are great and look very natural. You cannot see disposable breast pads with this bra and I never leak through. Good quality hook closure and I can easily unhook with one hand which is important! Bra maintains shape after many wears and washings.
4	1297209600	This is my 5th baby so I've been around the block as far as nursing bras go. A little history-I used to think Walmart was the only place to buy them and so I got the Playtex ones-they were fine, smuggly ugly, but fine. This time around, I went to Motherhood and found the prices cheaper! Yeah! However, the cup went all the way down to the bra line so they did not hold in that which they are supposed to hold in. I was measured at the store and bought that size, and the next two cup sizes up and none of them actually held the ladies IN! I was constantly rearranging...and I mean like 2-3 times an HOUR! Forget sleeping with it on-no help!So, now I come upon this bra. I was QUITE hesitant to buy one online that I had never tried on before. But I read the reviews and that gave me a pretty good idea of what size to get. I am EXTREMELY PLEASED with this product!!! They provide the support and hold I have been yearning for, I have not had to tuck anything back in, great for sleeping in, too! My only problem so far, (the package just arrived 3 days ago!) is that once you undo the clips (which there is a double snap-not just the single as I am accustomed to) the strap that holds the main part of the clip slides up on top of my shoulder-making it very difficult to be discreet about reattaching it. Will take some work to get used to I imagine. (That's why I only gave it 4 stars-this is a KEY element to the nursing bra!)I have not had the issue of the inner pad sliding at all-again, only had this product for three days. Also have not experienced the "rolls" issue as some talked about. My guess is theirs was too tight and needed to be slightly loosened, as I did. I was also afraid, from the photos, that it would create the "una-boob" look as sports bras do, but thankfully, it does not!I was a 40E in Motherhood styles and got an XL for this brand. Fits well!Pros-great support, variety of colors, can sleep in it, NO WIRE, looks great on,Cons-price (although once you've had a few bad ones, you won't care what the price is to get something RIGHT!) and the lack of discretion in clipping it back up.**UPDATE** After using this bra for a year of nursing, the only time I had issues with the inner pad sliding around was during washing. No saying where they would end up in the wash cycle! Usually OUT! I still prefer a more discreet re-clipping after nursing, but I found I just didn't nurse while out as much as I did with my first. Otherwise, it would have been much more of an issue and probably resulted in a loss of a star.  Now pregnant again and still holding up (no pun intended) well. No wearing or piling or stretching that I can see.
2	1296864000	I am a 40 DD and chose the XL, but it fits so loosely that there is really no appreciable support. I place it on the tightest hooks and have the shoulder straps tightened all the way and it is still too loose (mostly around the ribs/bustline, not so much the shoulder straps). Also, the hooks on the back are placed oddly to one side so it really strains my right wrist to put this bra on normally. I wish I had kept the packaging so I could return it and try the next size down.
4	1296777600	I bought this bra in my third trimester of pregnancy.  I love the comfort of this bra, the fabric is nice, it has a little 'give' to it, and I love the little insert thingies (they hide nipples if its cold, and likely milk shields when it comes time).I'm a 34 DD (I ordered a M, and will have room when I get engorged I think) and I don't find this bra as supportive as other viewers.  I would NOT wear this bra if I was going for a brisk walk, or bouncing my (hopefully not) fussy baby!  I would however wear this bra for sleeping in, or just around the house, or when wearing a really big, oversized shirt.  It is very very comfortable as previously mentioned, this is why I chose to keep it for lounging/sleeping.I contacted Bravado customer service and they were helpful with the other bras I may want to try if I'm looking for more support (the Bliss and Sublime were recommended to me, and the Allure for after 6 weeks of nursing).
4	1296691200	I am reviewing the Bravado Designs body silk seamless nursing bra.  I have two, one black and one nude.  Per the manufacturers sizing I ordered a large(I was measured as a 36 DD but I think I really might be a 38 DD). I should have gone for the X-large.  The material is very stretchy and fit nicely when I first put it on but as the day progresses it starts feeling tight around the rib cage.  I am currently 31 weeks pregnant and am carrying very high.  I am not sure if it is because of the fact that my belly is so high and the band happens to sit right where the belly is trying push up but by the end of the day I find myself tugging at the band to give myself relief from the tightness and the heartburn.  What I ended up doing was getting a bra extender which has worked beautifully.  I think once I give birth the bra will fit fine.  I know it is supposed to be a nursing bra anyways so hopefully after my belly goes down it will work just as it was intended.  I had to buy new bras because my old ones made me look like I had four boobs.  The cup size on this bra will definitely adjust to your changing needs as it is plenty stretchy.  I like the removable cups, I have worn it both with and without.  The three clasps in the back really gives you some needed back support.  Overall it is a good bra.
5	1296000000	I purchased this bra in nude at a local shop, but it was pretty pricey.  I discovered the bra when I was just a couple of weeks new to nursing.  My nipples were uncomfortable and this bra gave me such relief.  The snaps are nice and easy to use.  I loved it so much that I found the bra in black on Amazon for a cheaper price.  I can't say enough about this bra.  LOVE it.
5	1295827200	I love this nursing bra.  I wasn't sure what I would like so I bought 3 different models - this one, the Bravado Bliss and a Medela seamless soft cup bra.  This one is by far and away the winner.  It gives me great support while still feeling light and comfortable.  The shields that slide into the cups are a little annoying to deal with (take them out to wash, slide them back in to wear), but provide great coverage so your nipples are not always showing through.The Medela bra is looking very worn after only a few weeks of wear and washing (the same wear the Bravados have been subjected to).  It also has a tighter feeling band that gets uncomfortably tight on my ribs as the day goes on. The Bravado Bliss model, while comfortable, is larger and higher cut.  I feel like I'm wearing a granny bra with it on.Nursing bras aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for.  Go ahead and pay the extra for this one; it's worth it!
5	1295740800	Super comfortable nursing bra.  It's even more comfortable than my regular bras.  I wish I had discovered this with my first two babies!  The material is stretchy but supportive and has held up very well.
4	1295222400	I ordered this during the 7th month of my pregnancy when my breasts and belly really started growing. The wire bras would dig into my expanding belly and my cup size was changing. This bra grows with you and is very comfortable. The book "Baby Bargains" highly recommends the Bravado brand and I can see why. It's durable, comfortable, and supportive. The only caution is that it's kind of high cut, so you are limited to the shirts you can wear with it.As for the sizing, I was a 36 DD and increased to a 36 DDD in the final months. I bought a large and it fits well. Hope that helps.
5	1295136000	I bought this bra in my third trimester and have been wearing for past 3 months.the bra is very soft and so very comfortable but I still feel well supported.I would not go jogging in it however.The fabric expanded to contain my engorged breasts after delivery and now that I am nursing I find the complete exposure of my breast and one handed opening and closing of the snaps a plus.I would say these bras offer medium support while a sports bra would offer maximum support.The bras have held up to almost daily washings for the past month or so and I will see how it goes longterm.Re: the pads I use nursing pads now so I don"t use the inserts now...I did use them when I was pregnant.All in all a good buy.  Very convenient to use.  I must hold back an opinion on longterm durability as I plan to nurse for a while.
4	1294531200	I got this bra and thought there would be no way it would fit--I am normally a 36DD and pregnant I have gone up to a 38DDD so I ordered the Large.  It didn't look like it would fit right out of the package, but it did--shockingly.  The cups could be a little bigger for me, I know I will come out of them in a few weeks, but then will go back down after a few weeks nursing so I am keeping it because it feels great on.  Super soft and super comfortable.  It will come in handy when the baby arrives.  Last pregnancy my bras weren't comfortable and hard to undo to nurse so this one will work better!
5	1294358400	I am normally a 32 D however when Im engorged it's more like a 32 watermelon. This bra is very comfortable, supportive and expands to accommodate my changing by the minute breast size. There is no under wire which is a bonus and I also like that the nursing flaps are tethered to the bra so its easy to snap the flap back up one-handed. I ordered a small and its working well, however I probably could have gone up a size and been happier. Oh one last thing, it has a (removable) cup liner which camouflages a nursing pad and gives a nice smooth look under your tee-shirt or sweater.
2	1292976000	I bought this because I needed extra support with my new large nursing breasts.  I had been wearing mostly sports-like bras.  First, I ordered larger than I thoughtI would need and it was still extremely tight on my back which created rolls under my shirt.  I am not a large lady at 5' 8" 145lbs, but this bra made me look chunky even with clothes on.  Also there was an area where it felt like there was something sticking out that was itchy, but I couldn't find the source (somewhere in the seaming).  Even though tight, it didn't offer an abundance of support (the cup area is softer and my "ladies" still drooped).  Overall, just a not comfortable fit, didn't do it's job supporting and very ugly looking (I cried when I looked in the mirror with it on).  I even ordered the pink so that it wouldn't look like an old lady bra.  Not very nice.  Not for me. I feel like there is better out there for the money and I know Bravado offers other styles that are nicer than this.
5	1292025600	This bra provides needed support, is easy to unhook, and is very comfortable.  I love the extra padding that I can use or take out depending on how I feel.  I bought one and then looked for something cheaper.  After wasting money on a variety of maternity bras, I bought more of these.  Well worth the money.
5	1291075200	I've tried a few nursing bras and this one is by far the best. Although it's a little pricier, it is worth every penny. The clasps are durable (I've had others break) and they are easy to fasten. The bra has kept it's shape through several washings. It's by far the most comfotable bra I've owned. I wear it out and to bed. Great bra overall!
4	1290988800	I am 8 months pregnant and went to a 38DD. I wanted to buy something I could wear now and nursing. I chose the L size. It is very comfortable and I suppose the pads sort of useful if nursing but it is not really that different from a sports bra with minimal support. Being larger busted I need something a bit more supportive> It is possible that once I am bigger it will fit better. It is definitely comfy. I like the extra wide back strap.
5	1290038400	I nursed my first child for 13 months and bought 2 of these because I wore them everyday! They are so much more comfortable than the typical nursing bra. I bought several kinds and let me tell you, these are well worth the money! They are super soft and stretchy and provide plenty of support even without the under wire. (not good for nursing anyway!) I highly recommend these for any nursing mother.
5	1289174400	Good quality of fabric, very comfortable bra, you can open and close clips really easy with one hand. Definitely would recommend purchasing it!
5	1288310400	I have a collection of about 12 different nursing bras and NONE of them compare to this one. It's worth the price. I wish I had found it when I was pregnant because it's the kind of fabric that can grow with you, and I had SUCH a hard time finding bras that were comfortable.I bought this right after my baby was born and I'm still wearing it after losing 35 pounds, so it grows and shrinks with you. It's SO comfortable that I bought another one and I just hand wash and alternate them. So far both have stood up well and don't even appear to be wearing out after 7 months of exclusive use.The cups come out for washing and sometimes, in tighter shirts you can see a line along the breast but that's only with tighter shirts. Not on t-shirts, button ups or sweaters. I like having the cups because they hide a big wrinkly breast pad. You can take them out entirely if you don't need them. And they are washable.I've recommended this bra to several pregnant and nursing friends.
5	1287792000	I find these to offer better support than sleeping bras and you are not to wear an underwire while nursing, so these are the best for my body type.
5	1287360000	I had this bra (and some others) for my first baby born almost 3 years ago - I nursed her for a year and a half. Now that I'm expecting the next baby in about 10 days -- I went back for this specific bra... it is really great. It's 88% nylon and 12% spandex. It's very comfortable, snugs your body, and holds its shape for a very long time. They suggest you hand wash it ... but I always put it in the machine (rotating between 3 bras) and it held up really well -- I definitely wanted new bras at the end when it started to pill slightly - but we were done nursing by then. I imagine that for someone who would be more delicate about washing it - it would be like new for a very long time.The latch is easy too. Note that the removable pads on the inside are not meant to be washed with water (it's a 100% polyurethane - which I don't know how to wash at this point)...  I highly suggest this bra.
4	1286496000	This bra is totally worth the money.  I've tried all the cheaper nursing bras and they just don't have the support and comfort that this one has.  I wish I had ten of these!  I own some other Bravado bras and I have to say the quality of these products are excellent.  The removable cups are a little annoying because as other reviewers have said they move around and can bunch up everytime you nurse if you aren't careful.  I don't mind taking the time to adjust them.  I like that they are there because they hide nipples well and when the bra washes and dry easier because you can take them out.  This bra is like a sports bra when it comes to comfort, but it provides better shape and coverage because of the pads.  The straps are very sturdy and thicker than other bras I own.  This bra may not provide the thicker straps that fuller breasted women need.  I'm a 36B-C and this is my favorite bra!  I think I'll keep wearing it even when I'm done nursing.
5	1286409600	I'm 28 weeks pregnant and have tried four other maternity/nursing bras--two of which were Bravado. They were all the correct size, but I just couldn't tolerate the constriction of the band around my rib cage, especially when sitting. This bra provides support with a relatively soft and comfy band, and unlike other Bravado styles, it actually has clasps instead of a sport-bra back, so I can use a bra extender if I continue to grow. I'm so happy with this, I'm ordering another one in a different color.
1	1285718400	i had high hopes for this nursing bra, but was very disappointed when it arrived. while i would have preferred to try a bra on before purchasing, i chose to order online due to the fact that i have very large breasts (40F- before, during, and after pregancy) and, at least in my town, none of the maternity stores carry sizes that large.i ordered a size XL, which the packaging states will fit up to a size 46F; however, the panel barely covered both of my breasts. in addition to being smashed together, my breasts were hanging out the top and the sides of the bra. further, the shoulder straps were very thin, and i can only imagine how painful it would become after just a short amount of time. the material itself is extremely soft, so i considered keeping one just for wearing around the house; however, when i put a t-shirt on over it, the picture was pathetic. i would not even feel comfortable wearing this bra in front of my family. i also agree with the reviewer who complained about the removable foam pads. they arrived bunched up and ridiculous looking, and were difficult to straighten out.this may be a great item for smaller-chested women, but for me it missed the mark completely. guess i will stick to wearing my regular, non-nursing bra that i have to take off every time i breastfeed. :(
3	1285200000	I followed the sizing guidelines, but the back strap was way too short - easily remedied with a bra extender that I bought from Motherhood Maternity for under a dollar, but the cups were actually too big. I'm only 6 mos pregnant though, so I figure it gives me room to grow, and obviously the next size up (medium) would be way too big. It sure beats having to go to the store to try bras on though which I can't do since I'm on bed rest and needed a new bra for the rare occasion that I leave the house. Plus I'll be ready when the baby arrives and am able to do my shopping in person.
5	1285200000	The best nursing bra you can buy. Worth the money.  Very comfortable and seamless.  No underwire, which is good for nursing.
4	1284508800	I bought this nursing bra while pregnant and it fits a lot better after I delivered my baby. I think I could use the next size up still. Material can make you feel sweaty while breastfeeding. Prefer the microfiber bravado bra! But it provides good support, just make sure you get the right size.
2	1284249600	for the money I spent this bra is not great.  The fit is uncomfortable and it doesnt hold its shape.  It didnt wash nicely and I hardly wear it.  Dont waste your money.
5	1283904000	OMG, this bra is amazing.  I found this bra early in my 3rd trimester, and all the upper back pain (a result of heavy breasts and bras that didn't fit well) went away.  VERY supportive, non-shifty, and stretchy enough to work for a growing chest.  Also, attractive and low-cut, so you can wear it under real clothes, not just high-necked ones!  I haven't yet used this as a nursing bra, so I can't speak to the convenience of the clips, but the bra itself is incredible as a maternity bra... or, just as a regular one.  Bravado's size chart on their website is pretty true-to-size.  I'm about a 38 E or F now, and size L fits well on the second-to-loosest hook but not any tighter.  If you're at 40 band, I might suggest going for the XL.An update:  I've been nursing my son for 5 months now.  After about the first month, I had to go up to an XL (about a 38 F/G now), on the tightest hook.  These hold up great in the wash, and the clips work really well.  These are supportive enough for the daytime and comfortable enough to sleep in.  They look great under a t-shirt or a dress.  Basically, I like these bras enough that I think I'm going to continue wearing them even after I'm done nursing (even though my size may shrink down again... I'm willing to spend the money for a good bra).
5	1283817600	This nursing bra is everything you're looking for: comfort, ease of use, quality design, and a great fit. The fabric is incredibly comfortable, I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't tried one on before purchasing. The snaps and cup design (that offers removable inserts) are fantastic for realistic breastfeeding, they stay away when you're nursing and provide great coverage when you're not. This bra is flattering under your clothes and without - fantastic!
4	1283644800	I love this bra...I loved it so much I bought another! The snaps are super easy to open and close. The fabric is super comfortable and it fits really well. It's not a "going out" bra but to run around in all the time it's perfect. It's really supportive I find (I'm a 38DD). I wore it before I had my baby and wear it now so even when my milk came in it still fits well! I would recommend this product very highly!!!
5	1283126400	I purchased several other brands of nursing bras, both with and without underwires.  I could not handle the underwires and I am a 34 D.  I ordered this in Medium and it fits perfectly.  It is the most comfortable nursing bra out there and provides great support!  I have worn it all day and night and it has never bothered me the way other bras do.  This is the only one I will wear while my baby is nursing.
3	1282176000	I like this bra, it is comfortable and looks good under clothing.  The problem with it though is that it is not breathable at all.  SO if you have a summer baby, you will be hot and sweaty in it constantly!  The front comes up very high also, so I have to be careful with what clothing I wear it with.  Although the neckline of the bra looks like a tank top, so you can get away with passing it off as one underneath a shirt!
5	1282003200	This bra is amazing. I love how comfortable it is. It's also very supportive (I wear a medium) and it doesn't show through other clothes. I got 4 of them and will use them throughout my baby's first year or whenever he decides to stop breast feeding. I would buy one in white and chocolate as well if they made them in those colors.
5	1281052800	This is my favorite nursing bra.  Very comfortable, love the removable pads for more coverage(I leave them out at home and wear to hide my nursing pads when I'm out.)  Very adjustable fit, which is great as your breasts fluctuate in size, and great support from the seaming.  I have this in the butterscotch and black, rarely wear any others now, they still look great after almost 2 years of nursing my little boy.  I can't imagine going back to the underwire pushup bras I wore prebaby.
5	1279929600	This is an extremely comfortable and useful item for the breastfeeding mother. You can use the removable contoured pads to hide nursing pads, but I'm using the lana wool nursing pads which don't show so do not use the inserts. This seems like it could accommodate a range of cup sizes and provides great support and looks attractive under a shirt - as nice if not nicer than many non-nursing bras. I use it when nursing (with the milkies milksaver on the non-nursing side) or pumping (with the pump-ease hands free system on top). I got two to alternate between washes. Highly recommended.
4	1279843200	Overall, I have used and enjoyed this nursing bra.  The biggest pro is that it is extremely comfortable.  It is easy to use one handed once you've practiced a few times.  The cons for me include that the strap adjustability is a little loose - I am constantly readjusting it and that the bra 'peeks' out of many of my shirts and dresses (especially the ones that are the easiest to breastfeed in - a little annoying!)  It is just a cut a little bit too high in the front.  I would recommend this bra, and again it is oh-so comfortable.
4	1277078400	I bought this because it got such good reviews on amazon and other sites that sold it. I got it and really dont understand why so many woman rave about this bra. Its nice and comfortable, but not any more comfortable than the 15 dollar nursing bra's you can get at the motherhood store. The removable pads in it look strange, almost like a teenager trying to stuff their bra.
5	1275696000	This bra is great. The comfort and quality is far better than what the local maternity and bra shops had. The removable pads were anoying the first use, but it was because I've never used them before. Once I found the proper position to put them in the bra it was perfect. With proper positioning of the cups they become hardly visible.
5	1274659200	I am about to enter my third trimester.  As with most pregnant women, my bra size has increased.  I was reluctant to purchse new bras since they can be expensive and I didn't know how long I could wear them with my changing size.  Once I couldn't wear my original bras, I bought one nursing bra that fit at the time and was able to wear it for about 2 months.  I reached the point where I needed larger (and more) bras, but again, didn't want to spend alot of money for bras I could only wear for 2 - 3 more months.I decided to try the Bravado seamless nursing bra because they advertised that it would work with your changing breast size.  I also decided to stay with a nursing bra since I will hopefully be able to use them for the next year after my baby is born, thus getting more value out of them.  I tried on several different brands, but the Bravado seamless became my favorite maternity bra for the following reasons:-Will be able to accomodate me if my breasts increase 1-2 sizes.-Extremely comfortable-Looks like a regular bra under cloths - no uniboob look-The padded inserts are great for colder days-The snap closer is easier for me to put on than a sports bra type nursing bra-Holds up well in the wash-Great support; the band is thick (where all your support comes from) w/o bulkiness-No underwire to dig into my bodyWhile it is more expensive than other bras I tried, the ability to wear it for a longer period of time and for nursing make this bra a good value IMO.  I use the Original Bravado bra on the weekends so I don't wear this one out, but for work clothes and looking tailored, this is the bra for me.
4	1273449600	I tried on many maternity bras in different stores, but I am glad my friend told me about this kind.  I've read that maternity bras are not supposed to have wires, so this works great as there are no wires, the bra is comfortable and fits me really well.  The feeding clips are easy to work with, the only thing I would like to change is the back has 3 clips, so the bra looks a bit heavy.  I would like something a little more sexy, but I guess with the size of my boobs now, good support is what is necessary.
4	1273190400	Very comfortable and easy to detach/reattach the cups with one hand.  Inconspicuous padding under shirts except the full coverage makes it difficult to hide the bra with lower cut tops.
5	1270166400	This nursing bra is the only one I've found that's both comfortable and suitable for wearing out.  Other reviews mentioned the removable pads being visible, but I haven't found that to be a problem.  This one creates a nice sleek, supported look but also stretches enough to fit whether you've just nursed your baby or not.  And it's relatively easy to snap and unsnap the cup one-handed.  The straps keep sliding back down on me, so every couple of days I have to tighten them back up, but that may be a D-plus size problem.  Overall a great bra!
5	1268870400	This is an incredibly comfortable bra. I wished I would have purchased like three or four in one purchase. I could not believe how great the bra feels at night when sleeping. I totally recommend this nursing bra.
5	1266105600	The Bravado nursing bra is the best one I've ever tried, and I've bought about 10 nursing bras in my 4 years of nursing.  I kept buying cheaper bras at Motherhood and Target.  Most had some underwire (which is not good when your nursing, it has potential to clog your milk ducts), there was NO padding and very little actual support.The Bravado was totally different.  The moment I put it on, my back felt support unlike it's felt in years.  The removable padding is perfect for keep embarrassing moment at bay (but you still should wear breast pads if you have a strong let down other than when you are nursing).Some people complain of being able to see the padding through your shirts.  If I notice that happen, then I take a moment to adjust the padding so it fits the shape of my chest better.  Then, you can't see the padding again.  It has honestly never been a problem.I HIGHLY recommend this product to any woman nursing their babies.  The snaps are a little high and sometimes hard for me to snap closed with one hand, but that is a small, small price to pay for a product that is otherwise flawless...supportive...and protective.  I bought a second Bravado within a day of receiving my first. BUY this product!
5	1265414400	I LOVE this nursing bra!  I'm normally a D and am probably a DD at this point while nursing.  How amazing that there's a no-underwire bra that's comfy and supportive for someone my size.  Certainly pricier than what you might find at your local dept store but worth the money!  I bought one to try, already purchased another and plan to go ahead and order another one today--good to have one on, one in the wash and one as back-up.  Also, although my baby is only 2 weeks, this bra along with the use of breast pads has helped me not leak at night which saves my pjs, sheets, laundry time, etc.
5	1264896000	Very comfortable bra. One of the best nursing bras on the market. This bra is worth the money.
5	1258588800	I have three of these bras now, they are very supportive and really comfortable - I sleep in them as well. The padding insert is great because they hide the nursing pads.
5	1256860800	This is the most comfortable nursing bra I own and it fits nicely.  It was well worth the money.
4	1255219200	After trying Medela bras(and hating them!)in my 8th month of pregnancy, I decided to spend a little more and get the Body Silk bras. They are fantastic! Great fit and I don't even feel like I'm wearing anything. I deduct a star for the foam inserts. While they don't show much under a t-shirts, I wish they covered the whole cup as you can clearly see the line. Overall, totally worth the price!
3	1252022400	The Bravado! Body Silk seamless nursing bra is a decent nursing bra.  The support is OK for smaller and medium sizes; it is comfortable and soft.  The clips are the standard plastic clips that have become pretty much universal for nursing bras.One thing I really don't like is that the removable pads have a tendency to slide around and sometimes fold up when the cup is opened, which means every time you finish nursing you have to rearrange the inner pad.  This is not necessarily something that could be discreetly accomplished in public or in mixed company -- just something to think about.  If one does not use the pads, then there is nipple show-through, as with practically every other nursing bra out there (seriously, what are these companies thinking?).Overall, this nursing bra is good for casual, everyday wear.
4	1249603200	Early on in pregnancy I was in need of a larger bra, but couldn't find any in the stores that fit properly. I went for a "certified" fitting at a hospital women's boutique and the fitter recommended the Bravado. Pre-pregnancy I was a 34C, but the fitter said I'm now a 34F. She said as of that moment in time (I was about 18 weeks at the time) I would fit into a medium with this bra, but down the road might need a large. The medium felt just a tad too small and the large a tad too big, but the large was comfier if I attached the tightest hooks. I didn't buy in the boutique because of the cost. I'm really pleased with the bra--love the lack of an underwire and that it still gives me shape and doesn't make me look like I'm wearing a sports bra--i.e. no uniboob. The only reason I give it a 4-star rating is because the color is not what I expected. It looks much lighter in the photo. It's still fine for me, just darker than I thought it'd be. I would handwash to ensure longevity.
4	1249516800	I am normally an A but have become a C since I started nursing. This bra has been comfortable and provided enough support. The clasps are a little more difficult with one hand than my other nursing bras, but not bad. This isn't a good bra if you wear any low cut shirts, though, because it comes accross just below where, say, a tank top would. So you can wear it with a tank, but for v-neck or criss-cross front shirts, it will show.
4	1246320000	I found this bra very supportive and comfortable.  Some nursing bras are too thin, but this one had a good amount of padding.  It would make a good t-shirt bra.
5	1246233600	I made a mistake and looked at Amazon's size chart and had to exchange it from the seller.  This is my favorite nursing bra now and I plan on ordering more.  The material is so soft and the design is very supportive.
4	1245456000	I purchased this bra after ordering the Bravado Original.  I liked the Original, but as I was still pregnant my size got bigger and I needed another size.  I like the fact that this bra has a back closure as opposed to the over the head that was necessary for the original.  I think the bra has decent support although I do not think it is great.  That being said I am a 32F and I have never found anything that supported in that size.  I ordered my bra from[...]  and had excellent customer service.  When I ordered my original Bravado I ordered two others that were discontinued.  Didn't get them (figured I wouldn't as their was only one left).  Anyway, Melissa who writes the reviews (maybe the owner, I don't know) emailed me a few weeks later offering me the bras I ordered in a different color at the reduced price.  I mentioned my size and gave her my measurements and she suggested a different size.  She also recommended a similar bra by Melinda G saying that most women who try on both really like the Melinda G better.  I would wholeheartedly agree.  Even though the Bravado is not a uniboob look, the Melinda G is much more separating and defining.  I think the bottom band is more comfortable.  I had never even heard of the brand and this is baby #5 for me.
5	1245196800	This bra is the best nursing bra I have bought.  It is comfortable and fits great all the time!  Even though it seems pricey, it is definitely worth the money.
5	1244419200	I own several different brands of nursing bras and I never wear any of them but these--these are comfortable enough to sleep in and wear, and the lining pads are a nice additional modesty layer.  Great bra, well worth it.
4	1240876800	When I purchased this bra, I wasn't sure if it would work based on the reviews it received.  Mainly that the foam insert was too small and showed through clothing.  After finally purchasing it and wearing it for a while, I think the designers did the best they could.  The reason is that when you get the bra, the foam inserts fit perfectly inside the bra cup.  But since it's a S,M,L system and not a typical bra size system, it is designed to stretch to fit different sizes.  I am the largest size that fit under the Med. category so when I put it on, I stretch it out quite a bit and the foam inserts consequently, don't fit the entire cup.  However, I've found it doesn't show through clothing at all even white t-shirts.  So if you're hesitant because you want a bra with a foam insert, but are concerned this one will show, it doesn't - at least for me.As far as fit goes, I am the largest size for the Med. and I think I should have bought a Large.  I have to have the straps pretty tight to give enough support/lift and I think maybe a bigger size would help with that.  But it does offer enough support and even though the straps are tight, they don't dig into my shoulder like I thought they might.I love the fabric - I can't do the itchy stuff that they make normal nursing bras from.  I like the seamlessness of it too.I'm not sure how it will do with nursing as I'm still pregnant, but I've tried unlatching and relatching the bra with one hand and have been able to accomplish that fairly easily.All-in-all, I really think the designers did their best to provide a great seamless bra in a soft and stretchy fabric that provides enough support.  I think that if my breasts were bigger, the support might not be as great because the bra is so stretchy, but that's just a guess.I recommend the bra as I searched long and hard for something better (I wanted seamless with a foam insert and good support) and couldn't find it.  I think you'd be hard pressed to find something better too.  I only gave it 4 stars because I think it would be better to list my size as a Large and not a Medium (38C/D) and I think maybe they could have made the straps a bit wider for comfort.
5	1239148800	Comfortable, functional, looks great, and I love that it comes with inserts to successfully hide nursing pads. This is the bra I wear when I leave the house, otherwise I also like Bravado's Original nursing bra.
5	1236902400	I have been searching for a decent nursing bra that is comfortable, stylish, and functional, and have finally found it! This bra is great because it has a wide comfortable band that doesn't dig into my breasts as many others did, and it is cut low enough that it doesn't stick out under tank tops or low-cut shirts. I love the removable foam pads that prevent my nursing pads from showing through shirts. It is a little pricey but well worth it! Make sure you hand-wash to keep looking like new... I machine washed and dried my first one and now it looks a little worn... but still works perfectly fine. I am a 36 DD and wear a Large... XL would be a little big on me.
4	1236816000	I hate bras.  They either flatten me down, are incredibly itchy or make my back ache.  This one doesn't flatten and is so comfortable, I actually forget it is on.The nursing functionality on this one isn't the best.  The only thing holding the bra strap is a flimsy piece of elastic.  But it is so wonderful to have something that doesn't make me want to scratch my skin off.
4	1234396800	I have searched high and low to find a nursing bra that I like and that fits. I'm smaller but went up two cups sizes once my milk came in. This bra does the trick and it actually looks flattering under a plain tshirt! I do find that sometimes if I just have on a tank top and my son sees the straps he likes to grab hold of them and play with them while he is nursing. Also, the lining on this bra is like the lining for bathing suit cups and sometimes with one of my two bras the cups actually fold up on themselves when I pull them down to nurse but this is the most comfortable nursing bra I have found so I can live with that happen! This bra in my comparison is like the V.S. Secret Embrace bra.
2	1228089600	I recently ordered and received this bra, and immediately returned it.  I am currently a 44DD (still pregnant) and ordered the XL.  According to the size charge, an XL would still allow me to go up a cup size and band size.Pros:- Silky microfiber fabric is soft on the skin- One-handed release clasp was easy to operateCons:- Fabric has too much give, no support- Molded foam cups show through and look strange- Straps are very narrow and offered nothing in support or shoulder comfortI'm not even nursing yet, but I know that I've always needed a bra that does its job and supports large, heavy breasts.  This bra may work for more average-breasted women, but if you have larger breasts, find something else.  I know I'm still looking!
5	1228089600	This is a very comfortable nursing bra. It fits pretty good. It is fairly slim fitting on the side. I like the pads that come in the bra for extra protection against leaking.
5	1226361600	The bra is incredibly comfortable as well as seamless under shirts.  I love that you can unhook it with one hand to nurse, and I love the liners/pads in each cup.  It helps prevent the bullseye look from nursing pads!
5	1225584000	This is a great nursing bra, it is comfortable enough to sleep in yet supportive enough for daytime wear.  It's also easy to undo the nursing snap down clips.  I'm a first time mom so I purchased 4 different nursing bras not knowing which one would work or still fit after my milk came in...I spent $20-30 more on this bra then the other 3 and it is by far my favorite.  I also like that it is low cut enough that you can still wear v-neck tops with out the bra showing...
5	1225411200	This bra is comfortable and provides good support. I don't use the padding, but like that the double lining helps conceal the nursing pads from showing through. The padding is thin, versitile, and flexible - feels comfortable when I've tried it.The snaps are easy to use and works with the Medela Freestyle adaptors.  Also the product washes well and keeps it's shape.
5	1225324800	I've had Bravado bras before, but this one is the best yet.  Excellent support, very comfortable and easy to hook and unhook.  Highly recommended!
5	1224460800	Finally, after 3 children and several years of nursing, I found a bra that is comfortable and smooth.  The lactation consultant at the hospital recommended it and I now own 4.  I think I could transition these bras into sports bras after nursing is complete.  But best of all, the fit is superb.
5	1222128000	This is a fantastic nursing bra - very supportive and has a spot for pads.
5	1220745600	This is the only nursing bra that I have been able to find in actual sizes outside of an A or B cup if you have a small torso (mine is 32).  It has a great fit, is well made and does not ride up.  The vendor, breakoutbras.com, was very helpful as far as sizing and suggestions for an appropriate fit.  I will definitely be buying a few more of these for nursing after my son is born.
5	1217635200	I bought two of these bras and I have worn them every day for a year and a half. They show very little wear for the amount of washing they have been through. This is the most comfortable bra that I have ever worn, nursing bra or not. The sizing is exact. The foam insert in mine covers the entire B cup. With every other nursing bra I have tried, you can see the line from the nursing pads through your shirt.  I have never had that problem with this bra. It is so much better to have the strap down the side when you unhook the bra rather than a little hole to nurse the baby. I do use a differnt nursing bra for night but as far as daytime use goes, I would never buy anything else.
5	1217203200	This bra is very supportived and wonderful. I plan on getting a few more. Chris and Elena Bui.
5	1204070400	I absolutely love this bra. My only wish is that I had discovered it earlier in my pregnancy - I would've been SO much more comfortable! It gives nice shape (no uni-boob) while offering support & it's not completely hideous like a lot of maternity bras.
