5	1404864000	You will never need anything else. No more drugs no more doctor's no more pain. Ive gone through the back doctors the pills the whole ordeal of suffering from back injuries until I bought this and for the first time I am in control of treating where it hurts and can get to any location on my back. I could write a book on this product but I promise you this works.
5	1404864000	Great product, recommended by doctor for muscle knots, trigger points, in back.  Very lightweight and easy to use.  Pamphlet that came with it was helpful also.  Any place a muscle hurts you can use this.  Larger than other brands but that makes it easier to use with no straining to reach spots on back.  Helps me out tremendously.  My pain is at a much lower level, after using this for a few days.
4	1404864000	This is really useful if you don't have an extra pair of hands! As soon as you get use to the awkward stance you must take for it to work well!
5	1404864000	Love this! This little devise can get to all of the hard to reach areas when there is no one around to help. Hits the pressure points right on.
4	1404864000	The back buddy has helped me to deal with my fibro myalgia between appointments with my chiropractor.
5	1404777600	Life changing!! I have laid on tennis balls for years to hit trigger points in my back, and while that has always helped, it has never hit the spot as well as the back buddy does. This is a must have for anyone that has deep knots.
5	1404777600	Still learning how to use this thing, but I am impressed with it so far.
5	1404777600	Great for pressure point therapy. I have severe neuropathy and this does help.
1	1404691200	Useless
5	1404691200	Love my back buddy. Now I can get to the knots in my back and shoulders.
4	1404691200	The Body Back Buddy is a great alternative to the Theracane. I like that there are additional knobs and rods to help the user get to just about any spot needed. The two closely-spaced knobs at the larger curve are FANTASTIC for massaging the neck muscles or simply applying gentle sustained pressure (a la myofascial release). I have been using the rod at the smaller curve to release my psoas muscles and it's been quite helpful. Those things that make this superior to the Theracane also are drawbacks. Because there are more features, the Body Back Buddy can be unwieldy at times for someone with weak or painful muscles due to chronic pain. It also does not travel well unless you have a very large suitcase. The key to both the Body Back Buddy and the Theracane is to NOT FORCE movement or tense your muscles - neither the ones you're treating nor your arms as you hold the position of treatment.
4	1404518400	My chiro sells one like this for $75.  I wish this one was round like that, but the savings was worth it.  Feels great -
4	1404518400	Great massaging aid.  It gets all the hard to reach spots on my back, shoulder, neck.
5	1404345600	Love it. Should have bought more than two!
5	1404259200	I love this thing!
3	1404259200	I returned it because it was (way?) too small for me and may be for many males. I am 6' and weigh around 210 if that helps. where you can hit a trigger point though, it works well. I've been considering buying the bigger one ('original' i think it is called) but these things tend to be expensive. too expensive for molded plastic in my opinion.
3	1404259200	For me, the extra pressure knobs were not needed.  I wish I had ordered a simple shepherd's crook instead.  The only way I use it is as pictured.  It works wonderfully to relieve pain in my back.
5	1404172800	Really works
3	1404172800	I ordered this after researching the best self massage tools. I had been using tennis balls and thought there might be something else out there. I haven't really figured it out except how to use it a couple ways, and it just seems to be hanging on my stair rail.
5	1404000000	My girlfriend is a massage therapist, but I, on the other hand, am not.  While I try to follow her directions as best as I'm able, I don't ever seem to be able to hit the spot in just the way she wants - so while searching for a solution, I came across this and thought I would give it a shot.She was certainly happy that I thought of her and got her this, and she had seen other (not the same, but similar) devices in the past, but never was impressed enough to get one.  She gave this a shot and the next day was raving to me about how awesome it was, and how it allowed her to get in and get specific spots that had been bothering her for a while.On the device itself, one of the more interesting elements of it's design is that one side has slightly more pointed ends, while the other has more rounded/ball ends - this allows you to dig into a particular part, or give more generalized pressure.  The layout of the handles is also excellent for adding the the leverage and really letting you put pressure where you want it.  In terms of a massage, it's more like a deep tissue massage device than some sort of happy/relaxing spa kind...The construction seems excellent, very well made and I don't expect to see it breaking anytime in the foreseeable future - so if you're looking for some self-massage options, you'll be hard pressed to beat this.
5	1404000000	Awesome! I love it...couldn't live without it
5	1403913600	This is perfect to reach all the miserable painful places in my back and up under my shoulder blades between massages.
5	1403913600	Have some old injuries from my youth. After years of suffering in between massages. I'm able to work out the knots, kinks, and tension in the deep muscles on my own with this gadget. Wish I had bought one sooner is all I can say!
4	1403827200	If you use this every day, the trigger points will be reduced. They have for me.
5	1403827200	Been looking for something like this for 20 years.  Thankfully, my massage therapist recommended this item.  I will still drive 280 miles to see him, but it' not so urgent now.
5	1403740800	This saved me a whole lot of money from seeing a massage therapist for my neck pain. At first I didn't know how to use it and was about to return it. After playing around with it, I figured out how to use it best for my body. It is a bit weird and it takes some time to get use to it, but once you get use to it, say goodbye to your neck pain! This is awesome. I can't believe it took me this long to discover this tool.
5	1403740800	LOVE THIS!! I get back pains on occasion and just a small amount of movement from the back buddy and it reduces right away.
5	1403568000	If you are a chronic pain sufferer and know a thing or 2 about trigger point massage, you'll love this. I like this style better than the Thera Cane because of the pointed knobs for deeper penetration for those stubborn knots. I'm going to order the mini so I can using it while I'm lying down and want to work on my shoulder blades & kneck
5	1403481600	I love this thing!! It takes all the knots out of my back and it's easy to reach with this back buddy! It is made of a very durable plastic, sting enough to press firmly!
3	1403481600	I'm sure I could go online and watch a demo or something on Youtube.  I'm just too busy right now.  Be careful not to press too hard, it's easy to do.I don't think I'd buy it again, but I'll update my review if I change my mind.
5	1403308800	The Back Buddy has become an invaluable tool for me. After a long day at work, sit down with this and work out all the stress; it feels amazing. It's also invaluable in terms of working out knots in between or instead of a chiropractors visit. I've bought several as gifts and everyone loves it. The build quality is great, I can really dig in without worrying about it bending or breaking.I only wish there were a smaller version of it that you could fit into a carry-on luggage bag. I got the white small version of the Back Buddy, and it's not even worth it it's so cheaply built.
5	1403222400	I love this handy gadget. It's really versatile and it works great. I injured my foot and this allows me to work on it without contorting to get to my feet. It's great for a sore neck. Really wonderful product.
5	1403136000	Best back tool ever invented! Be-careful to not over use it at one time, as the booklet states! I give it a rating of 5 as it helps break up the muscle spasms that many of us suffer with. It is easy to get right to the trigger point and work it out! Great for any muscle pain or ache! I bought two as I have a friend who suffers terribly with back muscle pain. She loves it too! :)
5	1402963200	Had a major knot in my neck and used my body back buddy...felt so much better! Thank you!!!! I use it quite often
5	1402704000	I used to have to have friends dig their elbows into my back to work out some of the knots I had in my back.  This made that go away.  If you are having issues enough to be looking at this product, than you definitely NEED to get this!  It works wonders.
5	1402617600	This device may look odd, but it works!  It gets to all those trigger points that would otherwise require a masseuse.  Hit's the scapula, upper neck, mid back, trigger points on the side of the scapula, under the lats, lower side and mid-back as well.  Definitely worth the small investment.
5	1402358400	Love this device.  Helps my back so much. Tension and pain in back have caused me numerous problems through the years.  This device allows those knots to be worked out in the privacy of your own home without the co-pay of a chiropractor!
5	1402272000	I often have back pains in my neck and shoulder blades stemming from an auto accident years ago. This thing is awesome for working out knots. My back never hurt so good!
5	1402185600	I attended a health class at work and the instructor suggested the Body Back Buddy for muscle massaging.  It has been great for my back, neck, feet, etc. I'm glad I made this purchase and  it comes with an easy to follow instruction booklet.
3	1402185600	I originally purchased the Body Back Buddy, but returned it for the TheraCane. The BBB was just too cumbersome to use, being as large as it is, and with that "S" curve. Seems whichever side of the "S" I wanted to use, the other side would be sticking way out.  Why have something larger than it really needs to be?  After awhile, I really didn't like using it very much. Sent it back.So, I tried the Theracane. Perfect! It is smaller, the feel of the plastic is smoother and more comfortable, and it is just a sturdy. Quite portable the Theracane is.Everyone is different, though.  I would say if you're into working out all the time and nutrition and and exercising, the Body Back Buddy might be for you.  It is larger, for sure. Once learned, it *might* be more versatile, with all the handles and knobs on it.However, if you're just an average person like me who is in need of something smaller and simpler to help massage those areas you can't reach on your own, the TheraCane will probably be better for you.  Also, if you're older, try the TheraCane.  I think you'll like it.  Plus, it is small enough to take with you on vacation.
5	1402099200	I use this in combination with a foam roller to release tension in a variety of areas in my back. I have. Torn rotator cuff and have found ways to release the intercostal tension beneath my armpit by resting the area on one of the side handles while this device is vertical off the floor. This allows my body weight to create the pressure necessary for release. It is a lifesaver! I even bought one for my sister who does steel sculpting. OUTSTANDING and costs less than a single massage
5	1402099200	Very cool contraption. Easy to use and easy to store. It takes very little effort to create a good amount of pressure where you want it... So you won't pull a muscle trying to push on the knot between your shoulder blades. Much better than trying to use a door jam to get rid of back pain.
3	1402012800	Its good its helpful but they should get a video to go with it so you can know wverything you can use it on but it does the job
5	1402012800	This tool is amazing!  I can reach every spot that I have a knot and apply as much pressure as I need.
5	1401753600	I very like this. Body back buddy help I back a lot. I have back pain this help me. I very help
5	1401667200	Love this thing.  My ex husband had one and I used it all the time.  Got my own when I moved away from him and it's worth every penny.
4	1401408000	Does exactly as advertised and I am glad I bought it.$35 is a bit too much though, for this product. I would pay 25 bucks. Hence the 4 stars as against a 5 star rating
3	1401235200	This item could be better if it was made in different sizes.  This one would probably work better on larger people but I am small and struggle with the size of it.  If you are a small person, I suggest looking for something more size appropriate.  Medium to large people, this would work fine.
5	1401235200	I have this persistent knot right below my shoulder that I could never get to.  It has gone by several names over the years (mostly of bosses that cause the knot to get especially noticeable).  Professionals such as acupuncturist and massage therapists would find and get rid of the knot, but often they would miss it altogether and I needed a more constant and cost effective way to deal with Mr. [enter boss's name here].The back buddy doesn't replace my massage and acupuncture treatments when I need to relax, but it easily finds and releases the knot at a moment's notice.Highly recommended.
5	1401062400	This product gets all the hard to reach trigger points in your whole body. I highly recommend this product  to anyone in pain
5	1400976000	Fantastic! Finds those adhesions and releases tension perfectly. Easy to use, very effective. Loving the area for working the cervicals!
3	1400976000	I only used this for a week.  Its big, bulky, and pricey.  Its such an awkward tool.  I have been throwing it around my room because I dont have a spot for it.  All I can say about it that its sturdy and hard to break.Trying to massage myself and using tennis balls is a better and cheaper alternative.
5	1400976000	It can be used on various acupuncture points.  It was a birthday present for my son and he uses it.
5	1400889600	This is awesome for getting to tight muscles and massaging out any trouble areas. The design is such that you can relax and rest your body to let the back buddy just work into your tissue. It is good alone or with a partner helping.
5	1400716800	A do it yourself device that is amazing. And you can't beat the price. $35. Every home should have one.
2	1400716800	I found that the extra knobs coming off of the product hindered my ability to use the product the best I could.  On the surface, they would seem beneficial...they weren't.
2	1400630400	Purchased for my wife, she found it uncomfortable and the pressure was too much on her sensitive muscle areas and trigger points.  Amazon and the seller were excellent for the return. May be helpful for some.
5	1400630400	I Liked how that back buddy reached areas that i cant normally reach. I often have extremely bad back pain so it was very helpful.
1	1400630400	For the last three plus months I've been battling ongoing back and shoulder pain. I've been to the doctor a number of times who was not helpful at all and suggested massage. I've been trying to be proactive by doing both massage and trying to work in additional things that might be helpful. I came across the back buddy after doing a search and decided to try it since it had good reviews. As others have stated, there is no instruction manual. If you go to the website you can get one, but you have to pay for it - very stupid. I did some googling and came across some instructions online and have been trying them. This thing has not helped at all and I wish I would have gone with something else.
5	1400284800	This product is amazing! Definitely worked for me as I often get &#34;knots&#34; in my upper back. Made from good quality materials as well.
5	1400198400	This item is perfect.  It does exactly what it is designed to do.  It does what I need it to do and costs very little for the relief it provides.
5	1400112000	I haven't tried any of the competitors so I don't have any comparison, but this tool is excellent.  I especially like the two knobs that are close together that I use to massage my neck, one knob on either side of the spine.  It is great to be able to massage myself and not be so dependent on others.  It is light and easy to maneuver.  It seems very sturdy and well constructed.
4	1400112000	I had the original Back Buddy & looked all over the house for it.  Maybe others liked it too?  Not sure, but my shoulders & back always seems to be hurting so ordered this one & it works well, alittle better with the extra doo-dads than the original, but basically the same product.
4	1400112000	I almost decided to cancel this but decided to give it a try.  I have a spot in between my shoulder blades that is very hard to reach, even for massage therapists.  They always seem to be &#34;near&#34; the spot, but never directly on the spot I need to be worked on.  This thing does a pretty good job at hitting the spot, but it's a little bit awkwardly angled for the area I am trying to get.  It's been better than anything else I have used but can start to rub my skin raw after awhile.  I wish there were mini tennis balls or something on the knob parts.  Overall pretty decent.
5	1399852800	There's that spot on your back that always spasms right?  The one you can't reach and nothing helps?  Well, get the back buddy and your problem is solved.  You can pin point the spot and apply as much pressure or as little as you can stand.
5	1399852800	I am a student at a demanding university and am a very stressed out person so naturally, I have a lot of tension in my back, shoulders and neck- partly from carrying a heavy backpack that my back muscles likely can't handle and also in large part from poor hunched posture over my desk anywhere from 8 to 14 hours per day in aggregate. That overabundance of muscle tension creates a back full of knots that are comparable to marbles in hardness.I used to waste a ton of money getting massages because I couldn't reach all those knots on my own to press on and release them all. Out of money and desperate for back relief, I looked into personal massagers. Out of all the 50$, 100$, 200$ personal massager options, this one was the most purchased AND highly rated.At the relatively cheap price, I gave this &#34;Body Back Buddy&#34; a shot and was pleasantly surprised at how much better I felt in the days following my first couple days of use. Knots in the muscles, as previous masseuses have told me, must be pressed on and stretched out for days until they fully release. But how many of us can afford (or can justify paying for) daily massages?BASICALLY, &#34;Body Back Buddy&#34; is amazing if you have a ton of tight muscles in places you can't reach very well. At 22 years old, I found using the contraption to be very intuitive. Not to sound sexual, but this thing has knobs in all the right places--- perfectly designed to get reach and leverage/pressure on even the most difficult spots to reach (in my case, the center portion of my back on the muscles that surround my spine). If you suffer from chronic muscle tightness like I do, you will greatly benefit from this product. The &#34;Body Back Buddy&#34; really hits the spot. I've only had this for 2-3 days now and I already feel a significant improvement in my back muscle tightness, which actually improves my mood and attitude A LOT. I only wish I found this sooner so I could've saved all that money I spent on massages. The back buddy is a drastically cheaper, more convenient, and (in my experience) more effective alternative to trigger point massage.
5	1399766400	The BBB is made from rugged plastic, its like the synthetic plastic they use to make decks with, not the plastic they make spoons with.  It looks like it will last forever.  At first I kinda thought that the extra knobs were ridiculous, but the knobs are definitely worth it.  There's two that are perfect for getting the back of your neck.  The pointed ones are much better for getting to pressure points in my back.  Awesome.  I used to see a chiropractor every time I got a major issue with my muscles and now I can take care of them on my own.  Also, I'm currently a student and study for ten hours a day at a time.  This really helps my shoulder, arm and neck when I get done.  So its not just for athletes.
3	1399593600	The full-size Back Buddy is light weight and easy enough to use. Light enough, I would imagine, even if you have arthritis or physical limitations. It's possible to reach all parts of the back, shoulder, neck, etc. If you are used to a massage, or using a tennis ball, the Back Buddy is providing a different type of pressure: stationary. With the massage and to some extent the tennis ball, the pressure is moving and stretching. The Back Buddy knobs are good at pressing inward but don't give the stretching motion. I think that makes this tool somewhat useful, but it would depend on what you are looking for.
2	1399507200	There are a number of problems with this design. First, it's over-complicated. The vast majority of the knobs don't serve any purpose that I can see. I'm a fairly big guy. The larger hook fits over my shoulder nicely, but the pointed end is too intense to use. The smaller hook is a squeeze and can't reach a lot of my back, but the knob on the end feels good on the knots. I also had to get out my dremel and smooth off the join lines.It works, and for some spots the extra handles really help, but in general the theracane is a better choice.
5	1399420800	Don't got an SO that's willing to comply with a massage you after a long days work? Well, this is for you.Source: Guy with upper back problems.
5	1399334400	Ive had a nasty back issue from a work related injury and this tool may look useless, but it's the best invention ever. I always looked at it in my chiropractors office and said to myself one day &#34; self, give it s try&#34;. Well not only did it work great, but it was a smaller version that this one. This back buddy has endless possibilities. You can use it on your hip joints, psoas muscle, feet issues, calves....everything. It's by far the best invention ever made. Also my chiropractor wated 3 times the price it was offered on here. So if I could give it 10 stars I would. Loosens knots in shoulders, spine, butt, legs and everything else that has pain issues. Be careful because looks can be deceiving. It looks like a gimmick, but it digs pretty deep into your muscles.
5	1399248000	I tried this out at a friend's house and ordered one for myself the next day. If you have any type of back or muscle tension anywhere, this is an awesome tool! I use this on my problem area: shoulders. If I go deep with it I will be sore in those areas the next day, in the same way you would be after a deep tissue massage, and in my book that's a good thing!
5	1399075200	I use this nearly everyday, it can reach every part of the neck and back and gives you a really deep massage! Much more effective than trying to use the corner of a dresser or something. It is also strong and sturdy, the only complain is that if you are thick in the torso it can be difficult to hit the lower back but with a little trial and error You can find the right angle to get in there.
5	1398988800	was a little difficult to adjust to, but after you get it right, you are in heaven! its a little pricy and i was hesitant to purchase, but it was a good purchase!
5	1398902400	I use it all the time to get help with my migraines. I don't even bother my family for back / neck massages any more!
5	1398816000	i love this guy! the different shaped pressure points allow you to dig deep and work out muscle knots. i use mine all the time.
5	1398816000	Love this thing.  Works great for loosening up tight back muscles.  I'm 6 feet tall and 210 lbs.  One of my concerns when ordering this thing was that I might break it.  Not gonna happen.  It's tougher than it looks!  The size and shape are just right for getting to any of those hard to reach spots too.  Worth every penny!
5	1398729600	I've been a massage therapist for close to 10 years and there is still no better way for me to alleviate my own better neck and shoulder issues. I rely on it weekly.  I've given this as gifts and it's always a big hit.  No one can find your problem spots better than you! Stick to the &#34;meat&#34; and go easy on yourself.
5	1398729600	My husband has chronic myofascial pain, and this tool has been so helpful to workout problems with trigger points.  He can use it himself, or the family can help to apply pressure to a point without straining our muscles excessively.
5	1398729600	Does a great job at getting to the hard to reach spots and gets the knots out well.Recommend it .It does take a while to get used to it but it is all worth it in the end.
4	1398556800	There's only so much you can do with this, but if you have that one hard to reach trigger point that you need to get at, this is invaluable.
5	1398556800	I am only 35 but have had severe back pain every day since I was about 20.  I have scoliosis in an s-shape and being the mom of a toddler kills my back.  My hubby works all the time and I can't afford to get massages or physical therapy.  Thank goodness for the Back Buddy!  I am sitting here using it right now.  I just hang it on the back of my desk chair when I am done.  It really helps my upper shoulders and lower back!  I am very thin, so I can fit the curved part all the way around my waist and back.  It hits some very sore/deep tender muscles that I could never get at before.  Right above my hips in my lower back, those muscles have been killing me since I was pregnant!  I know not everyone can use it this way, but it really helps me!  Also helps my neck.  I haven't looked up any videos on how to use it and I have only had it a couple of days, but I love it.
2	1398470400	I loved this for about 24 hours - until I could not move my shoulders. I had so much pain in my shoulders that I thought I was having a heart attack. My doctor assured me that I was fine. I stopped using this and my pain went away.I have friends that love it but it is not for me.
5	1398211200	I am a massage therapist and have always wanted to be able to work out my own trigger points...this has made that possible. I love it !
5	1398211200	Ever day I wake up with problems with my back and seems like no matter what I do I can't get my lower back to loosen up and not ache. I stick this thing into my back and walk around for 25 seconds at various points on my lower back and it makes a big difference.
5	1397779200	What he wanted
5	1397606400	Great at getting to those hard to reach spots on my back and shoulders.  It's the perfect tool for getting into those pressure points.
5	1397606400	So glad I found this tool...  There is no better way to work out deep knots and release trigger points.  Amazing product!
4	1397347200	For people with nerve pain like me it really helps. I can put the end just where I need to put it to get relief. I can also use just the amount of pressure to do me the most good.
4	1397347200	This therapy cane is as described. I was a little disappointed that the little booklet came apart and was ripped off of the actual product by the time it got to me. But it still works and is usable. I have been using this for the last couple of weeks and it works perfectly. I am able to rub out sore spots on my shoulders and back with no problems. It's great to reach places I could not rub or press on myself, and my significant other didn't want to spend so much time rubbing out my kinks. I'm glad to have this is part of my bad back repertoire. I considered many other products before purchasing this one this one seems to do the trip just fine
5	1397260800	Great product. I love it. What a relief from this well designed gadget. No batteries so simple and intuitive to use on all parts of your body. Find where the muscle aches are then massage for a few seconds. Addictive relief!
3	1397260800	In my opinion the simple &#34;S&#34; ones are better. Plus all the handles are great and everything, but its kind of hard to store this thing if you don't have a lot of storage. The front knobs are pretty useless to me, I like the simpler design of the standard &#34;S&#34; shape and find it easier to use.
3	1396915200	Some days it seems to help, others I am not sure if I can just can't get the angle I need.  My PT suggested I get a theracane.  Not sure how I feel now.
5	1396828800	releases so much pressure you don't realize is building, I bought it as a way to exercise and work an area for the weeks I am not at PT and it makes such a difference
4	1396828800	Super easy to use and multi-function to help with all your sore spots...a definite must have for anyone with aches and pains.
5	1396828800	This thing is awesome, if you have muscle pain in your back caused by small, deep knots, this thing is for you.  Easy to use and well worth the money.
5	1396828800	If you have knots in your back this is the product for you! I was able to work the knots out of my back with ease
5	1396828800	It is very easy to use and my massage therapist was happy I had gotten one..Can use it all over the body..
5	1396742400	If you don't have a girlfriend, this is perfect for the price this is an awesome tool to massage your back.  Unless you know an affordable hot asian girl that will do it for ya.
5	1396742400	This is a God sent miracle...i no longer need to depend on others to maasage me. This invention is FANTASTIC!!
5	1396656000	Haven't tried all the little knobs yet, but the ones I have work wonderfully.  Just right for temporary relief from sore muscles.
5	1396569600	One of my co-workers bought one of these.  Everyone in the office wants to use it.  I bought one for the office and one for home.  It works very well for massaging kinks out of my back and shoulders.  My wife likes it too.
5	1396483200	This product is Awesome. I suffer with Big Knots behind my shoulders and can't massage them myself and with this product I can which relieves intense pain from muscle spasms.
5	1396483200	Definitely worth every dollar spent. It will get all those hard to reach areas that you normally wouldn't be able to get to .
5	1396396800	Excellent tool for anyone with spine or muscle problems. My three sisters and myself all have one and love it!
4	1396396800	It sure works when you can not get to your chiropractor quick.  It helps to get to the area that you can not reach on your own and do not have someone who can help you to massage your tight muscles.  You will hurt when you are pressing on the area that is giving you problems but you just keep moving it around the area and wham! It takes the pain away.
4	1396396800	The buddy gets my hard-to-reach muscles. I like that it came with a book suggesting ways to optimize the buddy during use.
5	1396310400	This odd-looking contraption works great.  You would never think so from looking at it but boy are the other reviewers right.  This works for so many different ailments...arm pain, back pain, side pain, neck pain, leg pain, foot pain...the list goes on and on.  It does require some patience but boy does it pay off if you give it a chance.  Excellent...and won't break the bank.
5	1396137600	Very helpful, and gets to places I can't reach on my own. I only use it on my back, mostly neck and between and under my shoulder blades. It's not great for rubbing at a spot - better for just pushing steadily until the knot loosens a bit. It's somehow different than I expected, but it makes a noticeable difference, especially if I sleep funny and my shoulder gets tight.
5	1396051200	I recently acquired what is likely a bulged disk in my mid back... causing numbness in my left thumb. I could not stretch this out...It became so bad I could not sit in my desk chair to work and had to take time off.I went to Chiropractor... getting needed alignments... then also a good deep tissue massage.It is getting better now.. my boss told me about this, so I ordered it and WOW... this really is helping to release the tense muscles that is part of this back issue.... I have seen it but never tried one and am very happy with this. Check the youtube videos on it to help to know how to use it...
5	1395878400	Wow!!! Hits the spot literally. I stopped getting my trigger injections. Absolutely love it! My sister in-law has muscle knots too so I bought her one. She loves it as well! Would definitely recommend this product. I tried the theracane and it's too flexible this is more rigid, can apply more pressure. And has more knobs. Better product same price. No brainer!
5	1395619200	I love this thing, it gets to all those painful hard to reach places. I have stopped begging my fiance for back and shoulder rubs, so he loves it too. It's awkward to move travel with, but it's worth it. Highly recommended esp if you have fibromyalgia and love trigger point therapy.
5	1395619200	I get stress knots around my scapula frequently, especially with stress.  I reviewed this one and the other two versions.  This one combines the features of the other two and works great.  I usually keep it with me in the car so it is ready to use wherever I am.
3	1395619200	Bigger than I expected and too much stuff going on. In hindsight I would probably go with the Theracane which looks less like a Klingon weapon.
5	1395619200	This piece I equipment has literally changed my life. I have chronic shoulder and back pain. I use my back buddy daily on trigger points to lessen the pain and discomfort. Five minutes and I'm goo to go all day.
5	1395532800	I knew I was going to love this product before receiving it. Now I can reach all those &#34;spots&#34; in my back that refer pain to my eye, resulting in headaches.  I can apply enough pressure for a sustained period of time, and feel relief from headaches within an hour when no other solution has worked.
5	1395532800	Waiting a month between massage sessions to address myofascial trigger points is killer, especially when I'm uncomfortable nearly every day. This theracane has given me the chance to take back control of my body and address my trigger points more effectively than a tennis ball or random object in a contorted position, and on a regular basis.
5	1395446400	With this cane massager, you really wont need to go visit a therapist. Find the tension spots or knots, and just do it yourself. I use it almost nightly before going to bed.
5	1395446400	Works well at getting those trigger points.  It is slightly obnoxious to have around,but when I need it, I don't complain.
4	1395446400	I use the body back body after my workout everyday. It helps reduce the soreness & knots on my shoulder & arms.
5	1395446400	Comparing this to the Theracane, I feel the Body Back Buddy is a superior product for its rigidity alone. Others I have talked to have like the Theracane since it has more flexibility, preventing them from bruising their skin while using the product; however, I appreciate just how much force I can transmit through the Body Back Buddy in kneading hard to reach spots on my back. I would rather have a higher ceiling for force transmittal than less. The wide and narrow curves, which respectively also sport a point vs. ball end, are very useful in targeting different areas of your body. I've used the BBB for quite a while now and it shows no signs of wear. Great product!
5	1395360000	This is an awesome tool for being able to get at the knots in your back yourself, and by doing it yourself, you can really feel what works and doesn't.I was pretty sore the next day after massaging out the knots in my upper shoulders and neck, but it was that great sore feeling of release.
5	1395273600	A must have!  Great for getting to those hard to reach areas.  Bye-bye to to those trigger points!  Very strong, will not bend or break.
5	1395273600	This thing is magical and really helps work out the knots all over my neck, shoulders and back.  I just wish it fit in my suitcase.
4	1395187200	I bought this thing in response to my friends showing me his 'Theracane.' I am a climber and it can really rip up your back and shoulders. I have this lying next to my couch and I'll just use it to press on the knots and it feels friggin' GREAT. I also use it on my feet. The included instructions show you all sorts of ways to use it but I don't really. Just be careful the first couple times you use it; I bruised the ba-jesus out of myself.
5	1395187200	I have had one of these in my medical office for a long time to show patients how to self massage trigger points.  I finally got one at home after carrying my too big for carrying kids around.  It has been great.  I've had lots of friends come over and say &#34;what is that weird thing&#34;  they often don't want to try it.  however if they linger eventually they do and all have been converted! I think I am going to start giving it as a stress relief gift!
5	1395187200	Yes, this thing looks strange, BUT OH does it do the job!  I bought it for my wife, and I find myself using it more than she does!  I'm an aging drummer ;-) who constantly suffers from neck/back pain.  The Body Back Buddy works wonderfully on all areas.  Best part is I can work it while watching TV!
4	1395014400	as a trainer needed a device to get to the points where a foam roller doesn't really get.  handles well and the nodules are placed in the right spots to hit this trigger points.  Some may need to get the video to get the full potential out of it.
5	1395014400	Can really focus on knots... you can really feel it break them up and release the toxins in your muscles
2	1394928000	I used it to try to alleviate a headache and it gave me one instead.  Also hard to use.  Save your money.
5	1394841600	Body Back Buddy saves me and is you have any back issues this is what you should try, also use it on hips
5	1394755200	Hello everyone,,,So i usally dont write reviews, but this was a must as i laid in bed with relief from this tool, Quickly withgreat pleasure said i must write a review. I suffer from a lot of stress & latly life has given much more of it.My back has tightened up with knots & i can bearly move.This Tool will take the knots out , make your blood flow 70% better & i had the best sleep of my Life, ''Thanks be to GOD''Forget about messages, this is to apply pressure on those knots which in turn while doing it  '' it hurts'' but if you do it rightwhile applying the pressure on the location of the knot & taking a deep breath & hold your breath for as long has you can whileapplying the deep pressure, When you exhale then let the pressure off the knot , do it a very times in different locations.100% you will feel better. This is great this product works. I recommend it to all people that is looking for serious relief.I will buy another one for my car & will bring it with me for work to take a brake & use it in conjunction with some breathing exercise.There are other health benefits to having your blood flow better.Thank you my buddy , you are defiantly my buddy. lol...Alexander
5	1394755200	My wife and I have really enjoyed the Body Back Buddy.  It has provided relief for some lower back soreness.  it easy to use and it reasonably priced.  It is very sturdy, something I will have and use for my lifetime.
5	1394668800	I have fibromyalgia and torn rotar cuffs. I have many trigger points and neck and back pain just about everywhere.This is the perfect self massager when no one is around. I can actually reach many places with just a change in theposition of the back buddy. There are two different sides. I like the smaller one because I am a small person. It is toeasy to get to those hard spots. It takes a little getting use to in that you have to determine the right amount of pressurefor your trigger points. If you press to hard you will hurt more. Plus everyone in my house grabs it all the time to useon their neck and back. Just a smooth back and forth motion and you can actually give yourself a massage. Does not tireyour hands like some other devices I have tried. Highly recommend.
5	1394668800	I bought one for a Christmas gift and ended up buying one for myself as well.  It comes in handy in between chiropractor visits.  The person I gifted it to is constantly telling me how much they love their Back Buddy as well.  I'll be sure to grab a few more as gifts for other people who have constant back aches.
5	1394668800	bought it for my daughter, she loves it!  she had seen them at her workplace and wanted one for at home, and she has used it several times, says it really helps!
5	1394582400	Does everything it is supposed to do and is very sturdy. Worth many times its purchase price over the long run. This will last a lifetime and I consider it nearly unbreakable.
1	1394496000	It is entirely useless. I use a lot of different massage tools and this contraption was the biggest waste of all.
5	1394409600	This is product is great for relieving tension and hard to reach areas. You can really put a lot more sustained pressure in an area that anyone could possibly do with their hands. I don't know what I'd do without it. It gets me through until my next massage and often gives me more relief. There have been times that my neck and shoulders were so tense and painful that I thought I might have to get a massage between appointments but after using this product I was fine. It has saved me time and money. It also fits in my suitcase without taking up any extra space.
5	1394409600	This thing works great. If I have a pinched nerve of just a knot in my back I can work that thing out with this bad boy. Can reac any spot in your back. Love it!
3	1394409600	I tried to apply all the new techniques I learned in accordance with the &#34;Trigger Point Therapy Workbook&#34; but I found it a tad difficult to accomplish any pain relief for my aching neck and back, so it sits on my living room table idle.  Bummer.
5	1394323200	I decided to buy this instead of the Theracane because I thought it had more options in the shape of it. I have been using it for a couple of weeks but purchased it a month ago. Once I have started to use it I am happy with it. You do need to take a little time to try different ways to use it. Just do it.
4	1394236800	I like this item and it makes it much easier to address sore/tight muscles in my back.I would have rated it 5 stars if it had come with better instructions about how to use it.  There are on-line videos that can fill the gap.  It would be nice if it came with something that demonstrated more clearly how to massage the back.I would definitely recommend this to a friend and I continue to use it regularly.
5	1394150400	But no really, I have some mondo rods in my spine and this thing is awesome. It's hard and knobby in all the right places. I feel that it will also come in handy in the apocalypse--just attach some blades and you've got a Zombie Back Buddy.
4	1394064000	It's hard to give yourself massage. Even someone else give you the massage, you know they can't quite get the area that you want to get little more pressure,  If you have experience something along the line,  this will do it for you.It seem to be very easy to use, but it really take some time to learn how to use it effectively.  I just got BBB and only able to use it on my lower back effectively. But, after do this couple of times up/down on my lower back area, you can feel the pain lifting around the back.  It's too bad that I have to search all over the internet to find 'how to' use BBB. It should provide more detail instruction with the package.  But my back feel better using the BBB,  I am willing to learn how to use this more.It works and price is just right.  But lack of instruction, I have to give this 4 stars, otherwise, it would be 5 star item.
1	1394064000	I seen a lot of great reviews for this so I decided to try it. But, I found it extremely awkward to use and hard to manipulate to get to the right spots on my back for treatment. Applying the correct pressure  ends up becoming a workout and sort of defeats the purpose as it creates tension in the muscles needed to use it.  Laying on tennis balls is still more beneficial and relaxing then this uncomfortable device. A lot of folks like it but it didn't.
5	1394064000	Instead of asking everyone in my family to constantly rub my back, I can finally do it all on my own. I initially felt it was a little expensive when i bought it but its well worth the pain relief.
5	1393977600	This really hits all the right pressure points.  No more explaining to my husband..higher, lower, to the right... HOWEVER, I did NOT receive the booklet that comes with it. I would like to have it if at all possible so I can use the product to its' fullest.
5	1393804800	for people that know how to use this device it is WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you did not know what a trigger point was or had a background in medicine or massage therapy you would not know how to use this and it would be a big waste of money. THAT SAID...... i do know what to do with it and it changed my life, I no longer have to go to the massage therapist, I can get to all my &#34;knots&#34; when they hurt!! AMAZING!! I will never be without one of these buddys.
5	1393718400	If you are like me, I cannot always afford a massage every time that I need one. This technique helps to work out those hard to reach stress knots using your own strength and pressure. There are various points on this device to help reach all areas on your body that tend to hold in stress and become painful and sore. This is truly awesome and you wont regret the purchase.
5	1393718400	I keep the BodyBackBuddy next to my couch, because that is where I use it, but it doesn't really blend in with my decor. A number of my house guests have hesitated to ask me about the &#34;bright blue curvy stick&#34; sitting next to my couch, but after a short demonstration by me, and a few minutes of hands-on product testing by them... its not long before they are adding this product to their Amazon wish list. It is that good.
5	1393632000	Great to reach all of those hard to reach spots and get the knots out!  This has really helped me in between massage visits to keep the stress knots to a minimum, even my massage therapist commented that she could tell a difference.
5	1393545600	After suffering a traumatizing injury at the end of 2012 that broke two of my vertebrae and my pelvis, I acquired arthritis in my spine. I was prescribed a number of prescription and over the counter pain pills, but I've found that nothing works as well as this device. It means the world to me to finally not have the intense pain in my back, neck, and pelvis that once woke me up at night. Anyone who is experiencing tightness or pain in their back muscles (or really, anywhere else on the body) needs this wonderful tool. I've been using it both alone and with a partner, and it really works to target pressure points with a deep, powerful massage. If you're on the fence about buying one and have never tried it, I suggest at least giving it a chance, because you might be amazed at how much it helps.
5	1393545600	I am having so much fun trying out different knobs, on different areas of my body. Its much better then others that I have tried. Great tool for self acupressure and trigger point therapy. I am a massage therapist, I will be recommending this to my customers.
5	1393459200	Great for hitting those trigger points.  Easy to use. Perfect placement of knobs and points.  Sturdy plastic that should last a long time.
4	1393372800	as weird as this looks, it actually works pretty well for those hard to reach places, even if it looks like a 17th century torture device.Just don't leave it on the floor between the bedroom and the bathroom, then it really DOES become a torture device.
5	1393286400	Loved it!! I borrowed one from a friend who's my masseuse and this is simply a MUST-HAVE for those who are prone to trigger spots especially on the back of your neck. Decided to buy my own and I've been using it every day now and then.
5	1393286400	This product (as explained with the product literature) was designed by a massage therapist.  Well guess what?  The therapist invented a product that really does work to massage knots right out of the muscle.  I am a verified buyer I am a back pain sufferer.  I love this product! It works like an elbow pressing on the knot.  AND THE BEST PART you can do it yourself!!!  A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!
5	1393286400	great at getting those pesky trigger points.  must buy if you are always tight and stressed. ive seen others, this is the best ive used.
5	1393200000	This is bigger than other back buddy type canes, but I carry it with me nonetheless, tucked into the wall of my van.  I work a lot bent over a desk and nothing reaches the back of my neck and between my shoulder blades like this thing.  It takes little effort to get a deep massage in just the right spot if you need pressure points pushed.  I press in and move it up and down a couple inches, move to another location.  It can be as comfortable or as 'painful' as you like.  Really loosens up a tight muscle and if you do it right, you can feel the pleasant haze a good massage gives.
1	1393113600	Based on the great reviews, I bought this thinking that it would really help release my trigger points and the tension in my shoulders, but I was wrong.  It actually makes me more sore every time I use it (and I do not shy away from pain - I gave the Rumble Roller a rave review and that thing is intense, but totally effective).  I wouldn't not recommend this.
5	1393113600	I have had mine for year it is the only way you can break up knots in your back by your self. I use it all the time and notice a difference!
5	1393027200	I was having problems with my back getting cramped or knots developing... I would always suffer while waiting for an appointment with my massage therapist to deal with my back and often my back would feel much worse by the time I got in.  I use this when I feel a knot developing and it's gone!Pinpoint accuracy.  As much or as little pressure as you need.  More combinations of pressure and angles than you could imagine... Just don't fall down the stairs onto this thing.
4	1392940800	I just received this product and the instructional booklet was not included in the packaging. From what I could use of the product without the instructions it seems to work well, but once I am sure of how to use this product I will be able to write a better review.
5	1392681600	&#8220;Back Buddy&#8221; came highly recommended by my Doctor and therapists. Tried it out at the medical office and felt it was specially designed for people with neck and back problems. Liked the sturdiness and all the information that came with it in order to optimize workout. Highly recommend it and will be buying another for the office.
5	1392681600	I like this product very much - was told about it from my physical therapist actually - I will state however that my recommendation would be to purchase the smaller one (I believe referred to as a travel back buddy) as this one (the original and larger one which I have) is just that - large so to find a spot for it to rest besides a closet, if you will, becomes difficult.  Regarding the most important thing - how it works - you can get every trigger point that you may have issues with at times and it's wonderful.
5	1392508800	Now I can finally reach those knots in my back by myself and don't have to ask anyone to help me- and that is priceless!
5	1392508800	My wife loves it very much. Now she can massage her own back without having to ask me to do it.
5	1392508800	Years ago I gave my theracane away to a friend in need. When I went to buy another one, I saw this Back Buddy and decided to give it a try. In my experience and opinion, it is far superior. The different nobs, additional curve and angle helps me reach each spot on my back, shoulders and neck in a very satisfying way. It has brought me great relief.  I also use it on my legs.  I bought one as a gift for a friend I love it so much!
5	1392422400	This is amazing.  Works great when you can't get to the massage therapist.  I am a firm believe in Trigger Point Therapy.
5	1392422400	A coworker of mine ordered one for our ultrasound department. She found out that our old massage therapist used one on herself. She asked her why she had never told us about it. The therapist just smiled and said, &#34;I'de be out of business if I told everyone.&#34;
5	1392336000	So I got this just to see if it really worked like YouTube said and it really does. It doesn't massage you so get something that vibrates if you want that. It takes like one minute to check and find your pressure points on your back and all over and what I found is I have many more sore muscles than I thought. Basically it hurts so good when you press on the muscle for a few seconds but it does work. It's sturdy and easy to use while just sitting watching TV and it works best when used often. The muscles dont just get better with one use so just take your time and use it for a few minutes a day or twice a day and you will feel the difference. You can also get on youtube and see how it is used and tips and tricksEnjoy
5	1392336000	this is useful for all of us in the house, I don't mind rubbing knots out but now I don't have to at least not as long as would be needed. Great for all the pains, no matter where they are.
5	1392336000	Yes, this is a bulky trigger point release tool, however, this tool is not designed with gym-go'ers in mind that have a trigger point or two that may be aggravated by exercise, this is for the people, like myself, that have overlapping referral patterns from dozens of trigger points throughout the body. Will it work for casual use? Absolutely. But for people like me that need it to relieve pain and work with it for hours every day... it doesn't need to fit in my backpack nicely. In fact, I love that it is one solid piece that I don't have to worry about screwing/unscrewing, breaking, etc. This just won't be broken . It's well-made and works exceptionally. I can now reach any area of my body which is a lifesaver. Before, I tried to use a softball with my hand which required me to put a lot of effort into the release (which then caused more trigger points to form/activate). Now, I can use leverage to work the knots out without hurting myself further. There aren't really any instructions that come with this- certainly not enough to know how to use it, however, if you are a chronic pain sufferer (no matter what kind of pain, you almost definitely have trigger points that have either caused the pain or formed as a result of other pain-causing conditions) and you've done your research enough to know that you need one of these tools, you know what you need to do to work out the knots anyway. A lot of it is intuitive anyway- you get a good, clear kind of pain. It hurts, but your brain knows it's what you need so it feels almost refreshing. You don't need a huge instruction manual to figure it out. If you don't know what to do with one of these things I recommend you purchase Devin Starlanyl MD's books. There are three of them. The latest one (the blue book) deals with self-care and how to find your trigger points. Her first one (the green one) gives you a great overview in a very user-friendly voice. The books paired with this tool make for a great trigger point release team. As for the Body Back Buddy, I couldn't be happier with it and I can't think of one thing I'd change about it. There are some knobs I've never used, but I'm sure I'll find use for them eventually. There are countless ways that this tool can be used to improve your quality of life.
5	1392163200	For anyone that holds tension in their muscles using the body back buddy enables you to give yourself a massage. It lets you reach all the achey muscles in your back, shoulders and neck. You can even massage your feet. If you are lucky enough to get professional massages, this is still great for the days in-between.
5	1392076800	Very well made and it targets the knots I get in my back. It does take some maneuvering around to get it just right though.
5	1391904000	The Body Back Buddy is a very well-designed item that enables you to reach all the pressure points you couldn't reach otherwise-- along the spine, between the shoulder-blades-- anywhere you need to do some pressure-point massage, the Body Back Buddy will reach it.  Well worth the money.
5	1391904000	I have long suffered from a bad back since throwing myself off salmon river falls. Later in life I also began having bad sciatic issues. Now I use this along with my teeter and a high density foam roller. Between them all I have very little back issues and when I do they are easily resolved. This is excellent for deep tissue pressure therapy.
5	1391731200	Since my husband can't seem to massage me more than two minutes before HE falls asleep, this tool has really come in handy for my very knotty back. I've had several trigger-point injections and they don't really do much for me but this oddly-shaped apparatus has helped. As an added bonus it's fun to see people's faces when they ask &#34;what's that?!?&#34; because they think it's some kind of sex toy...
4	1391644800	Simple, but effective. Really gets those knots out. Great tutorials on YouTube that helped get the most out of it.
5	1391644800	It does not bend like the Theracane I have.  Truly a tool made for what it does!I have bought at least 5 others for friends who also do Trigger Point work on themselves.
5	1391644800	&#34;i dont know how many massages i went hoping somebody can help w my tense back. ever since my 2 pregnancy and bad posture, i always gets tense sore back, not shoulder, hard to explain exactly where it is to massage therapist but this way i can take care of it my self!!!!! i watched some youtube video on trigger points and it helps a LOT!&#34;
5	1391558400	If you want to enjoy the relief of deep tissue massage but can't afford a regular masseuse,  get this wonderful tool and learn how to use it(not difficult).  Of course nothing can replace human touch but the effect of this  comes close.
1	1391472000	Friend bought it and it just makes your back even hurt more.I wouldn't buy it at any amount even if it was free.
5	1391385600	I work out quite a bit and it results in very tight muscles in my back to the point where I can't turn my head.  This thing is awesome at digging in to the knots in my back and giving me relief.  It won't cure cancer but it's much cheaper than a massage and very versatile.  You can use it on your feet, neck, quads, and calves.  I was tempted to get one for home and the office.  Might need to do that.
5	1391385600	I love this gadget!  When I can't get out for a massage, the back buddy is my BFF!  It is very sturdy when I need deep tissue treatment.
5	1391299200	Get those hard to reach spots without relying on someone else to do it for you. I think it's a great product.
4	1391299200	My physical therapist recommended this. It really helps the knots on my back. I bought my mother and son one for Christmas.
4	1391126400	Some of the knobs have pieces of plastic flashing on them which is sharp and not comfortable to press into skin. These need to be filed off before use, but should have been done during manufacturing. Other than that, it is a great way to get pressure to those places you can't reach on your own.
5	1391126400	Paid about $35 for it, got my moneys worth after a couple hours of use. Great if you work at a desk all day. I've tried the Thera-cane also, its good as well but the Body Back Buddy might be a bit nicer. Solid and durable construction.
5	1391040000	Wonderful tool to use to get the knots out of your shoulders and neck.  Really helpful tool.  Easy to use.
5	1390953600	Hits all the right pressure points you couldn't reach before and gives you ability to put right amt of pressure you want.
5	1390953600	We bought this for our son, and he really likes it!  It seems to help his back.  Recommend this product!
5	1390953600	This really works well when your in pain and have tried everything else but can't find any relief. Helped my neck & shoulders.
5	1390953600	I have been looking around for one of these for awhile. I'm glad I found one here on Amazon. It works great for my neck and on my back. It's a bit bulky but it works!
5	1390867200	I got this as I have shoulder problems and had 3 arthroscopic surgery. I get a lot of spasm in the muscle near the shoulder blade and I usually get trigger point injections every 3 months. I have to say this is almost as good as the injections to relieve the pain. I did have a really bad spot that pain medication could not get it to stop hurting but using this it relieve it and that makes me very thankful for this product. If you have any problems with knots than don't hesitate to get this its worth every penny and then some. I also use a Moist Heating Pads - TheraTherm after and I have to say it is nice to get a little relief of pain as I have been dealing with this since 2002 when I had a accident at work. I have tried a lot of product and the Body Back Buddy was the best thing I ever purchase.
5	1390694400	This back knobber was purchased for someone else. They used it in their physical therapy training class and I figured it would make a great gift. It was easy to use and is effortless when relieving tension in those hard to reach pressure points on your back. I would recommend this product.
5	1390608000	My dad is a massage therapist and uses this himself! My fiance has tight muscles from her workouts so I bought this for her since my hands get tired (HA!). I love her but when I don't feel like giving a massage she just whips this out and works out the tough spots herself. The parts that jut out seem oddly phallic but they all have a purpose...massage...for your back. I have actually used the nubs in the curves to massage my feet though and that is wonderful too. Highly reccomend for anyone with a tight back/neck...or a spouse with a tight back/neck.
5	1390521600	No more rubbing my back on door jams refrigerator corner etc. This makes life so easy to work out the knots .
3	1390435200	Good for small back massage but still not a substitute for a real massage person. All and all not a bad product.
5	1390435200	A must have. I'm a massage therapist and I use the body bud daily..best thing if u can't get regular massages!
5	1390435200	You know exactly why you want this thing, and I can tell you it's worth every penny!Know how it feels great to rub a knot in your back with your fingers but then your arm just goes to sleep....then you have to rub your arm with your other arm....and then your back just hurts again?This fixes all that.  The pointier knobs are perfectly shaped that you can put a good deal of pressure on your knots without it feeling too sharp.  You can reach some amazing spots with this thing!  In case you can't tell, I'm pretty excited about it.Oh and as for the comment about it being too small for guys....I think he may just need to adjust the angle so the back buddy is more horizontal to the body.  I'm pretty average, 5'10' 165lb, and it works for me with plenty of room to spare, so don't be concerned about that unless you're really on the big side.Happy Relaxing!
5	1390348800	A co-worker of mine had one of these and he let me use it.  I am totally in love with this product.  I have chronic back & neck knots and problems.  If you use warm heat first and then use the back buddy you can literally dig the big knots out yourself!
5	1390262400	Use this everyday to release trigger points in my upper back and neck. Good ability to create the desired pressure for strong or mild pressure.
5	1390176000	Works great at getting knots out of my back and neck. I recommend it for anyone with a sore back, neck or shoulder.
3	1390176000	I own this back self-massager as well as a Theracane.  This one is more ridgid than the Theracane, which is a better feature for this one, in my mind, but the Theracane has a deeper curve to it which allows more coverage and leverage to certain areas of the middle back.  My opinion is the Theracane is a superior design with respect to the leverage handle placement as well.  This item does have more options on it though for other uses than does the Theracane (e.g. foot massage nubs).  In many respects it's a trade off and just will depend what features are more important to the individual buyer.  If I were to purchase another of this category of item, I would purchase another Theracane over a bodybackbuddy.  The bodybackbuddy is still a good quality massager, but I don't believe it is superior to the Theracane in its design.
5	1390089600	I have multiple sclerosis and my massage therapist has helped significantly when I've suffered neuropathy in my limbs using trigger point therapy. This product allows me to use those techniques on myself.  Although it isn't quite  the same as a trained professional it has helped when I've had moderate to medium muscle neuropathy and other muscle aches.  This device is effective and well priced,  I spent a little extra to get the video which explained usage for many different areas that I wouldn't have thought of.  Both are worth the price and the seller provided the item in a very timely manner.
5	1390089600	AWESOME tool for self manipulation anywhere on your back and shoulders. I have the iJoy chair massager but it just can't reach many areas that I need manipulated to relive major amounts of pain. This tool will let you pin point your exact areas of needed pressure with as much pressure as you desire. And if you want to really dig in, this will let you! I did the research on the other versions of this item and this seemed to be the clear choice for me. I am a tiny gal at 5'2&#34; and this worked perfectly (ie: I do not need the &#34;Jr.&#34;).
5	1390003200	I've had mine for a couple of years and it works great in working out knots and kinks in my back, mostly from sitting at my desk working on my computer all the time. And since my wife hates me, and won't give me a good back rub, it has been invaluable.
1	1389916800	Couldn't figure out how to use this thing for the life of me. It's just sitting in my garage. Maybe I can use it to hang my clothes to dry.Gave it a try to massage some knots out of my back and it wasn't really doing it for me. Maybe I'm using it wrong.
2	1389916800	My wife and I got this based on a recommendation from our chiropractor. It's a bit awkward to use and sometimes seems counter-productive since your using your own muscles to loosen a knot in your muscle. We found it hard to relax the area you were triggering since you were doing the work. Ultimately, we threw it in a box somewhere and we just give each other massages as needed. I suppose this is good if you don't have someone to help you out on a regular basis.
5	1389830400	This product is a life altering piece of equipment. I have been using this to push out knots and massage muscles, and it's great because only you know that &#34;exact&#34; spot. I will say, after a back injury, a physical therapist taught me how to use it even better by coming in on muscles from the side with the pointed knobs rather than straight on. Rather than pressing with my top hand, I would pull from left to right or right to left. I hit knots straight on with the ball knobs. The neck muscle part is invaluable.I love this thing and when I thought I lost it, I immediately ordered another. Found, and now I have two. Glad for it!
5	1389744000	As advertised good product!!! And Good investment, very useful. Never know how you needed the item till you start using it!
5	1389657600	I have been struggling with a strained QL muscle in my back for almost 3 years and have tried ever possible solution to fix it: physical therapy, massage, foam rolling, inversion table, stretching, yoga, heating pads, back braces, etc. Massage did provide some relief but that wouldn't last more than a few days.  So I read up on trigger points and figured I would give the Body Back Buddy a shot.I have used this product for one week and have noticed a significant reduction in my pain - I never would have thought that was possible. Unlike rolling on a tennis ball or a foam roller, this device will literally get up and under your other muscles to find the knots and trigger points that are buried deep within. I discovered that the pain in my QL muscle (which attaches somewhere under your rib to you back) felt a lot better after I located a huge knot/trigger point under my shoulder blade.I really can't say enough about how great this thing is. My husband looked at me like a crazy person when he saw it laying on my coffee table - it is definitely strange looking. But you just need to experiment with all of the knobs and angles to find the hot spots in your muscles. You will know once you find them - trust me.
5	1389657600	I bought this for a friend for her birthday and she loves it.  She has neck and shoulder problems and I let her use my Theracane and she loved it, so I saw this and bought it for her.
5	1389657600	I was taught how to use this by a physical therapist and it works.  Whenever I get knots in my shoulders or back, I use this device for 30 seconds on each knot and get relief.  Great investment.
5	1389484800	We love the Body buddy, it is so good especially when your muscles are sore after work outs, it helps break up the muscle tissue and relieves any knots that are stress related. It is heavenly on the neck and shoulders where usually it is so difficult to get to with a foam roller or a lacrosse ball. The way it is made to apply pressure is genuis, you don't need much effort to exert the pressure needed to relieve the pain. Great buy!
5	1389484800	This has so many different knobs to get to all the muscles.  Even some I still do not know how to use. The plastic is really sturdy, and I got this for cheaper then a lower end product at the store.
5	1389398400	I think I heard angels singing LOL!  This thing is AWESOME...so great that I am not sure there are words!  I'd give it way more stars if I could, it is THAT good.I never knew devices like this existed until my physiotherapist was trying to give me ways to manage a spot in my neck and mentioned a plastic hook thing with a ball on the end that they used to sell at her old clinic.  On the hunt for that, I stumbled across this much more involved version and the reviews finally convinced me to try it.  Such a great decision!It took me a while to figure out how best to use this thing for me, and I am still discovering it's amazing capabilities.  But the first time I got it to a spot in my neck that was really tight, and got the angle right....well, I felt it in every cell of my body.  The relief was so intense I almost cried...and it is the kind of thing that I didn't really even know was bothering me THAT much.  I have since found many spots like that in my neck, upper- mid- and lower back, shoulders, hips.  I am finding spots where my body carries stress and tension, and releasing it.  You can pick this thing up, find a spot that's talking to you, spend a few seconds releasing it, and get on with your day...and your day is so much better because of it.  And if you use it for a few minutes and find a few more spots, so much the better :).I'm in my late 40s, in relatively good shape, and it works great for me.  Every time I pick it up, I discover something new.  Today I am going to see what it does for my feet :).  I took it with me to visit my folks for a few days, and my Dad (early 70s) was complaining about being sore from some work he had done outside.  I said &#34;I have just the thing!&#34;, and of course we had a good laugh about the bizarre back buddy...but he played with it for 15 minutes or so and he felt so much better.The thing that seems to make it so effective is that there are so many ways to position, hold, and pull on it, that it is easy to find the perfect angle and pressure for each spot.  Those rather phallic appendages are very helpful as hand holds, as well as for getting into big muscles and into hips.  Don't just imitate the images in the booklet...play with it, alter the angles etc, and find what works for you.Honestly, I figured from the reviews that this thing would help me, but had no idea it would be THIS amazing.  It has become an indispensable tool for me, and everyone who tries it (following the shock and laughter) wants one.  One of the best purchases I have ever made.
5	1389312000	I love this thing. I no longer have to beg my wife to work out the knots that form along my shoulder blades from heavy lifting at the gym. Her thumbs would get sore after a couple minutes, but the BBB keeps on going. I'm able to reach all the pressure points on my back with ease. Before the BBB, I would have to visit my massage therapist at least every 3-4 weeks, but now I can extend the visits to once every 2-3 months. The device looks rather phallic to the uninitiated, but pay no heed to the funny looks because this thing works!
5	1389225600	As a software engineer I have many knots and tensions in my neck and trap areas from prolonged computer use.  This device is made of very strong and sturdy plastic.  Has enough variations of nubs to hit and alleviate all my problem areas.  It's grind out mild to moderate knots.  It has provided enough temporary relief for my really painful areas episodes until I see my massage therapist.
5	1389225600	I bought this for my boyfriend who has significant lower back issues.  He has tried the DEXIII, various hipflexor exercises, sports massages, etc. and has really found relief using the Back Buddy.  I've used it on my upper back (specifically, traps) and it works those stubborn "I-sit-at-a-desk-all-day-with-hunched-shoulders" knots right out.  As a runner, I also use it on the soles of my feel.  There are a ton of different moves to do and all are very effective.  I would recommend this product.
5	1389225600	If you don't have someone that can give you a back massage when you have those minor aches and pains that come up occasionally with your back, this is the thing you need.  Amazing how well it works.  Highly recommend it!
5	1389052800	If you are constantly knotted and in pain because of stress, and you are not married or dating a massage therapist, this is the tool for you! Granted you enjoy the good kind of pain that you get from a good shoulder squeeze.The good thing about the BBB is that it is so versatile. You can apply as much or as little pressure as you wish, to whichever part of your body ails you.I keep mine around for those times when my shoulders tighten up and I begin to feel shooting pain that won't go away. The BBB releases all the tension and relaxes me. It is a tool that I would not be willing to part with.
5	1389052800	Its wonderfull thanks. I loveit i dont speak inglish sorry. I dont understand this feedback this. Love you yes ok
5	1389052800	I have severe TMJ and upper back/neck issues. The body back buddy helps quickly and easily relieve muscle tension that triggers these problems. I loved it so much I bought one for my mom for Christmas. :) I have had to visit the chiropractor and massage therapist less often since purchasing this.
5	1388966400	This back buddy is AMAZING!!!  I had a really bad lower back knot and this is an awesome product. I love this thing. It allows you to control the pressure and get into a small spot.
5	1388880000	I use this at least once a month and it really gets into those tight spots. An additional benefits is that I can apply as much pressure as needed.
5	1388880000	The Back Buddy is great to manipulate sore spots in your own back, feet, neck, etc!  Terrific buy for anyone with a tight back!
5	1388880000	ok first I wanna say this is the most awkward looking tool ever.. looks like something that a woman would pleasure herself with.. but that being said.. this tool rocks.. it works so well for getting the knots out of your back.. its amazing.. and if you don't have someone to give you the rock star back rubs that get the knots out well with this tool is by far the very best you can get for doing it yourself
4	1388793600	I found this tool great to work out those tight spots in my lower back & upper trap.  I would say this is not for the non therapist to use as you have to have some type of knowledge of the muscle structure in order to use it as the booklet was limited in instruction. The company could have had a better manual as I have found many other muscle groups to work on with this tool than they gave.
2	1388793600	this thing looks like a weapon more than something that will help you. i bought this on another site because i think i had a better price there. this thing is sturdy, it should last a long time. it comes with really no usable instructions, and any videos online didn't help either. this device is in a word - awkward. it's hard to use, hard to reach points on your body. if you are a bit overweight, that knob in the middle will stab your mid section. used on the back it's hard to find the spot that hurts, because the  ends hurt no matter how you use them. the ball end doesn't feel like much and the pointy end feels like too much.I've tried using this on other parts of my body with no luck at all, and when i was really in pain, this thing didn't help me at all. what works far better is a lacrosse ball, in minutes it works better.then there is storage, you can't store this thing. it doesn't stand. it looks like a sex toy so putting it out in the open makes it stand out. it falls over, it hurts you when it does. it's just very hard to store.
5	1388707200	I continue to be surprised by the effectiveness and brilliant design of this product.  It works really, really, really well once you learn how to work it.  I've gotten body work for 20plus years, and while I wouldn't replace body work, I am thunderstruck by how deep it gets, and the relief it provides.  I highly recommend!
5	1388620800	I have had chronic shoulder pain for years so getting professional massages can get pretty expensive and small electric massage gadgets just don't cut it. With this not only can I work on the kinks myself but I can control the amount of pressure and different spots perfectly. It's made of a pretty sturdy plastic which helps when you are working on your back. Over all I am very happy with this purchase and frankly it has been an investment for me.
5	1388534400	simple and easy to use.  hide it under the couch and pull out at night while watching tv to get the best benefit.  Love it.
5	1388534400	I bought this for someone else, They were thrilled with it. I bought this for someone else, they were thrilled.
5	1388534400	Gets any knot out of my back in no time i love it love it love it i don't know how i survived without it
5	1388448000	my husband loves this!  he is always having back pain and wants massages.  this saves us some money!  he says it works great and can really work out the knots in his back.
5	1388448000	well, I bought one about 6 months ago, ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  bought one for my mom for christmas, she loves it too.  I'd recommend it to any person who has muscle pain.  A+++++
5	1388448000	I suffer from a chronic pain condition and I have a limited range of motion with my arms and yet I have no problems using this product.EASE OF USE - This thing is so easy to use and aside from the obvious uses for areas of pain and tension it comes with a VERY informative little instruction pamphlet that very nicely explains how to use the product along with additional detailed information on uses with trigger points and reflexology which was a nice surprise.LITTLE STRENGTH REQUIRED - Because of the design, the leverage on this thing is amazing.  It takes very little effort to get deep pressure virtually anywhere on the body.  Due to shoulder injuries I have a limited range of motion with my arms.  Basically, I can't really reach above my shoulders or behind me at all and I've yet to find an ache or pain I can't get to with this even with that limitation.DURABILITY - Aside from a big, big dog trying to chew on this I literally can't think of anything else that could damage this let alone destroy it.  I can see why the company offers a lifetime warranty.  They probably don't have to replace any, ever.The only con I can think of is that some people have said it is small enough to fit in a suitcase to take with you but it would have to be quite a large suitcase.  This isn't going to fit in any weekend bag or carry-on.This is one of the best purchases I have ever made and I wish I had only found out about it years sooner.  It has a permanent home right next to my couch and it won't be leaving that spot anytime soon.
5	1388448000	He finds it great for temporary relief between massage appointments.  However, be careful not to damage yourself by overdoing it.  You know the saying, &#34;if a little is good, then a lot may be better&#34;.  Not so in this case.  Take it easy, don't harm yourself.  Work the knots slowly, slowly, slowly.  I have heard from several other owners that really got into it and have traumatized their muscles and some nerves.  Use common sense!
5	1388361600	Definitely recommend, esp. if you are at a computer screen all day.  The smaller more compact ones did not work as well for me.
5	1388361600	I use it laying down, and apply pressure to the trigger points in my back until the muscles relax.  For this purpose, the size, shape, and handles are located perfectly for just the right amount of leverage to apply sufficient pressure without straining.  My wife teases my because the 2 straight handles look like a gentleman's sausage.  Haha
5	1388275200	puts pressure on specific muscle to relieve pain. Wish it would have come with video to help with positioning of nodes
5	1388188800	This product is pretty awesome.  It takes just a little practice to learn how to get the pressure right, but it is so nice to be able to reach those back muscles and get the pressure just like you like!
5	1388102400	I have limited movement in one arm  and extreme should/back pain due to an injury.  This tool works on every part of my aching body because I know the exact spot that's hurting and exactly how much pressure I need to use.  I love that the nodes have different shapes and lengths because it really does make a difference in how it works on the ache.Prior to usage, I had 16% shoulder mobility, and while it might not seem to be a lot to most, I know have 39% mobility.  Numerous chiropractors, masseuse, and pain management doctors couldn't get me to that point, so I see it as a huge improvement.
5	1388102400	Tries one from one of my friend's home. i am amazed how this long stick works. I ordered one rightaway. I use the body back buddy every morning before work and every night before I go to bed.
4	1388102400	I have those tight balls of muscle a lot of places on my back. Starting from parts of my butt, to my lower back, to along my spine, to my shoulder blades, the muscle just to the side of the armpit, shoulders, neck. I'm telling you, my back is pretty bad.With this back buddy I can pinpoint certain knots to relieve some of the tension. And this thing hurts. I've used the tennis ball and it works, but I hate having to either lay on the ground or put it up against the wall just to get deep in there. The two handles allow you to penetrate the knot very well. The shape and design really allow you to get anywhere on your back.While this tool does take a lot of the knots out, it is by no means a replacement for a back massage. As others have said, you don't get that rolling effect. After you use this back buddy it's more of an "ohhhhh s*** this hurts a lot" feeling rather than an "ahhhhhhh, this feels good and relaxing" feeling.If you can live with the self inflicting pain that this tool will give you, and let me assure you, if your back is as bad as mine, it will hurt, than I say 100% go for it. It's a huge upgrade from using a tennis ball.
5	1388102400	Delivers deep and direct pressure to those problem ares with very little effort. One of the greatest self healing tools. Easily reached those otherwise impossible to reach knots in my back.. on my own! Awesome product, worth every penny.
5	1388102400	this makes for great self therapy.  Used therastick before this one and the body back buddy makes it easier to get to some of the best trigger points.
5	1388102400	The body back buddy was a surprise for me. I have to admit my expectations were fairly low. It works quite well, but I have had to work on my muscles in short sessions spread over a number of days typically.The part that I use almost exclusively is on the end of one of the curved ends, and it is supposed to mimic an elbow. It has a smaller radius, which allows me to apply enough pressure to get into the muscles. The mechanical advantage is pretty impressive, and I don't need to force the device around much, and it applies exactly as much pressure as I allow it to.This is better than getting a massage from the spouse because I know exactly what muscles need to be worked on, and exactly how much pressure I need on that muscle.My only slight complaint is that there is plastic molding flash from the two halves. They scraped off most of it, but there is still a good amount left, and it scratches me. This is easy enough for me to take care of with some sand paper, but it should have been done properly at the factory.Again, this is only a minor complaint though, and overall, I am quite pleased with the device.
5	1388016000	This back massager is an incredible decive. It is amazing how something so simple in design can be so effective. You can place it in an area that needs work or you didn't even know needs work and give a good firm pressure massage to that location. Much more effective than the kind that vibrate. Amazing how it gets in their better than a person can sometimes. My only wish is that I could "relax" while doing it like with a real massage.
5	1387843200	When my daughter athlete uses it daily after every workout to roll out the kinks ... that's an everlasting endorsement.
3	1387756800	This device is the answer for self massage of the back.  It enables the user to reach those areas which are difficult to massage and it helps to relieve stress and muscle tension.
5	1387324800	This product is amazing.  I am able to massage my entire body, and it also come with a great how to do booklet showing pressure points thru out the body.
5	1387238400	This is more than a tool.This is an Apparatus!and this Apparatus is the most effective self massage tool I have found.This thing is Large and more substantial (heavier) than meets the eye; It is well made and is sturdy.It is large enough and has enough leverage to address your shoulders/neck while relaxing your arms, andIt is large enough and has enough leverage to easily apply pressure to your low back, hips, glutes, thighs, & bottom of feet.
4	1387238400	Helpful in getting the knots out without lots of pressure,  Definitely would recommend as  a good tool for people with minor aches
2	1387238400	Initially I was excited to receive this product but was a little disappointed. I have been using the Thera Cane at the physiotherapy office I have been attending for the past 6 weeks for 4 hours a day and 5 days a week. This means I was firm iliac with that product and have liked it very much as well as other members undergoing therapy. I thought this would be a better product as it had more points and constructed better.However I was not very impressed with it for the following reasons...1. I did not like the rectangle design of the main handle. It is uncomfortable to hold it when I am massaging pressure points of just applying continued pressure. It is also awkward to maneuver it. I thought the round handle would have been better.2. Despite the many pressure points, few of them I felt was not needed. The curvature of the cane is not wide enough to get a good grip to put pressure on certain points. This may not apply to people with smaller body frames. The plastic material is not very comfortable.Thus I had to purchase the Thera Cane as I know it works better. Thanks.
5	1387065600	Best purchase I have made in a long time.  Helping me feel good again.  Muscular skeletal problems have plagued me for years. This product is one part of my arsenal in coping with stress and physical pain. It is thus far the best tool in my arsenal!  I have been preaching its glory to everyone I can since getting it.
5	1387065600	I get terrible knots that cause headaches. This is amazing for working on them because you can control the amount of pressure and find just the right spot. You can find videos on YouTube that tell you exactly how to use it.
5	1386979200	If you need to work a knot out or an adhesion, this is the tool to do it. You can break down scar tissue and tweak your muscles in the back area, . Works like a dream
5	1386979200	I suffer from back injuries as well as Fibromyalgia, I love my new back buddy, thanks for a great product!
5	1386892800	After going to the chiropractor for 6 months for what I though was back problems, I've come to realize that my muscles were the problem.  Over the last 2 years I've been learning programming and I've been enjoying it so much that I often would sit for hours in front for the computer without taking a break.  Needless to say, gradually my lower back, right hip and more recently my shoulders and neck have been bothering me.  After getting a massage done and realizing how tight my muscles were I decided to do something about it myself.  I ordered the Body Back Buddy after doing a little research here on Amazon.  I just got it today and I'm ecstatic!!  I've used it for about an hour so far, just hitting whatever spots feel tense.  I can't believe the difference it's made already!!  It's well designed, using it is super intuitive and it's unbreakable, this thing pays for itself!!!  It's like a back-stratcher for tired, tight muscles!!!  Relief, finally!!!
5	1386892800	I have a herniated disc in my back, and as a result, back pain all over. This little device is astounding! I like to use it for my feet too. If you have serious pain, buy a trigger point book. I bought one of the highest reviewed ones on amazon, and love it. It reads like a textbook, but it helps me know just where to put this for relief. If you push hard enough you can hurt yourself, there's a lot of nerves back there, so educate yourself and be careful!
5	1386892800	it is kickass. but be careful, you can hurt yourself if you are too rigorous. fa la la la la
5	1386806400	Words can not describe how awesome this product is.  I use it every day with the high density foam roller.  For anyone with moderate to extreme back pain, I highly recommend these two.  I use them both every day and I have two herniated discs.
5	1386720000	it works every knot in your body. when I get a massage I expect a DEEP tissue massage, not a swish swash rub. this has helped me a lot!! and the price is great. a very well made product
5	1386720000	lol I was browsing all innocently Christmas coming along and saw this it looks like a giant &#34;p/g spot&#34; massager
4	1386633600	I work in IT and I sit at a computer quite a bit. This has created in my upper back from my neck to shoulder, to in between my shoulder blades. I was experiencing a lot of pain in my neck and shoulder blade areas. I developed muscle knots that I needed to smash against the corner of a wall to get any relief. My chiropractor would provide brief relief as well but the pain would be back withing a few hours.Now, with the back body, I am able to effectively massage my deep tissue muscle knots and started feeling more permanent relief after a couple of weeks.
5	1386547200	I had the opportunity for a side-by-side comparision of this Body Back Buddy trigger point massager and the Thera Cane.The Body Back Buddy massager is much sturdier; the Thera Cane definitely flexes when you're pressing the balls/pressure points against your back/shoulders/neck.  The stem of the Body Back Buddy is a reinforced rectangle (in cross-section) while the Thera Cane is basically a tube.  In addition, the Body Back Buddy has more balls and pressure points.This is easy to use and relaxes my tight shoulders, I'm glad I found it!
5	1386547200	Great to reach those spots you cannot massage by yourself? I would purchase this again. It is wonderful for twos back pain.
5	1386288000	Have ever needed a back rub?  NOW you can use this and hit those trigger spots that hurt.  I have Parsonage-Turner Syndrome and this is the best things I could have bought. I live alone, and has helped me very much.
5	1386115200	Absurd in appearance, the Body, Back Buddy is a great resource for anyone suffering with back pain. Designed to hit pressure points. Would recommend.
1	1386115200	I was convinced by the other reviews that this would be a fantastic and inexpensive alternative to getting actual massages. I now feel like an idiot.  Don't believe the hype.  This is completely made out of heavy plastic.  The pieces you are supposed to position into your back are hard plastic.  And, unsurprisingly, when you move it over your back it feels like plastic is being driven into your body.  If you can't fully imagine how that feels, ask your friend or loved one to dig the end of a broomstick into you.  Then ask yourself if you enjoyed that experience.  So, no, I cannot recommend this product.  I have lately come to realize that one alternative to expensive massages is simply to do more stretching exercises and actually correct things like posture and avoid carrying too many heavy things.  I recently bought a  tote bag with wheels that is doing a lot to stave off back aches.  Good luck to all in your pursuit of back health!
5	1386028800	Product does what it says it does. It reaches any area of the body with strong, penetrating,but gentle force, to hit pressure-points and break up adhesions and stiffness.Great for lower-back, or ANYWHERE on back, actually. Penetrates areas around shoulderblades especially well, and loosens up those lower back areas around the bottom vertebrae. Great for back-of-neck, thighs, even feet.Worth every penny, IMO.
4	1385942400	My uncle introduced me to his &#34;Back Buddy&#34; and I just knew I wanted one for my own.Pros: Effective, easy to use, sturdyCons: Wish it came with more instructions, best for average size people (not us &#34;fatties&#34;), big to take with you when travelingDespite the &#34;cons&#34; I would buy it again and recommend it.
4	1385942400	The Body Back Buddy was recommended to me by my chiropractor. It's very versatile and reaches into a lot of hard to reach places on my back. I wish it came with an instruction sheet/book/video. The instructions I found on You Tube weren't very helpful. You can buy a video when you order it, but they were over-priced. The device is quite large so doesn't travel well.
5	1385942400	Great product! Everyone should have one. I'm a massage therapist and this comes in handy to work on my own trigger points.
5	1385769600	Despite the funny looking parts of this think it is very effective in relieving pressure points from sitting at the desk and working on the computer too long.
5	1385683200	This has been a life saver.  I've had chronic neck and back pain for years.  I've been in therapy, had surgery several times and have every neck and back gadget on the market.  This really works for me and helps me focus on massaging the pain points I have.
3	1385596800	They must have used either a child or a &#34;little person&#34; in their ad, as this product is barely 24 inches long and does NOT give you the reach that the photos give the impression of! I'm a tall person, over 6 foot, and I can only reach SOME of my trigger points, which IS helpful, but not all. So if you're tall, you might want to re-think this as being for you!
5	1385510400	This is excellent for getting the knots out of my neck. I'm too cheap to pay for massages and I couldn't do it myself. This was the solution! I absolutely LOVE it!
5	1385337600	It is nearly impossible to get the deep tissue knots in the back on your own. With the Body Back Buddy I am able to massage out the deep tissue knots and helps loosen the tenseness.
5	1385251200	This product really rocks!  With almost no pressure from my hand and arms I can work the knots that accumulate in my back from using the computer too much.
4	1385251200	Definitely helps on trigger points however there are a couple of nobs on it that do serve any purpose. Would be better with an instruction pamphlet. You will figure out eventually what works best for yourself but it would shorten the learning process if they had some suggestions.
5	1385251200	I love it!!! It really works, and was recommended to me by my neck therapist.  I started using a lesser version i therapy and then I found the BBB!!!! AHHHHHHH1111 Relief...no longer so you need someone else to hit that certain spit on  your back and work the knot out...You can do it yourself.  I would highly recommend it for anyone that has neck or back issues..  It will break up those stressed out shoulders!
5	1385078400	A great way to reach those impossible places on your back to place pressure on knotted muscles. It is easier to direct to sore muscles than it is a friend.
5	1385078400	wow! finally i can massage my back! Thank you body back buddy!!! The quality is great and the price is right.
5	1384905600	Works amazingly well. I had a muscle in my back that was so tight that it was causing neck pain. 20 seconds of pressure with the back buddy on the spot and I got instant relief for a few hours at a time. I used it for about 3 weeks until my PT was able to fix the problem. I would have paid double given the pain relief I got with it.
3	1384905600	I read many comments on this, and it is a fascinating product.  However, these slip off your clothes. I kinda wish they made the end tip with rubber or something.  And the instruction guide they included in the packet was rather hard to follow.  3 stars.
5	1384646400	Great tool for those of you who suffer from muscle pain. I can now work on muscle and trigger points that I couldn't reach and I don't have to rely on someone to do it for me. only you know where the pain is. Great job guys.
5	1384646400	I RARELY write reviews of products unless they are superb or life-changing for me. I hope this does not sound like text from an "infomercial." The truth is, I have had back problems for over 25 years due to an inflammatory process that effects my muscles and joints so that they are almost constantly in spasm - especially in my neck. It gets so bad that chiropractors cannot adjust my neck because the muscles are so tight and won't release. I have done all kinds of therapies over the years and they all help - temporarily; e.g., Rolfing, e-stim, ultrasound, creams, supplements, meds, Thai yoga, massage, nutrition, etc. I exercise and stretch a lot and I am in good shape. I eat healthy. I am a professional medical provider and investigative journalist so I do extensive research on whatever I am writing about. Bottom line: I have 3 inflammatory illnesses and one of them is osteoarthritis. I am just now starting a regimen of clinically proven supplements (peer reviewed) to decrease the inflammation to try and get off my meds.Anyway, I have had the Body Back Buddy (which is hard to say - try and say it three times fast, LOL), for 10 days and I am discovering all sorts  of ways to use it on my neck, back and other areas. People say that getting a massage by someone else is better than doing it yourself - not so with a Body Back Buddy! I can use it at any pressure I need in the most crucial areas with minimal effort. I can stretch while using the device and move it gently while stretching to get it exactly where the muscle needs to be released. Or, put the knobs on one area and slowly move my body so it gets exactly where I want it. You can use it as a stretching device too (hard to explain in words - it has to be demonstrated.)Last night I used it for two hours and I was very sleepy afterwards because it released so much tension in my muscles. It is addicting!  Wow. I wish there was a distributor program for this device.It is sturdy, and the points and knobs are perfect! I am just beginning to learn the different uses. Not sure yet how to use it on my hands and forearms, which hurt from computer use.I wish I would have known about this device when it came on the market. I will recommend it to patients, clients and friends. I just can't say enough positive things about it.
5	1384560000	My husband uses this every night to work out knots on neck and lower back. This in no way replaces a massage however its great for putting pressure on sore areas.It comes with a booklet that shows the pressure points on the back and neck. This is very helpful. It is great for relieving sinus pressure. Would definitely recommend.
5	1383782400	I love this device.  It is better than going to the masseur, or acupuncturist.  I can get all these knots in back in just 5minutes.  Use it every day.  Worth the money.  :-)
5	1383609600	Great tool for those who love massages. Use it all the time in front of the tv. Wish my actual massage therapist would use this as it has a deeper touch than she has.
5	1383609600	without effort, i can reach the middle of my back where normally, any human is not built to reach. durable product. have been using for about a month.
4	1383436800	I like it pretty well. I thought it would be more effective than the Theracane my coworker let me try out... somehow it's not. But it still helps me quite a bit when I have a muscle that is really tight and no one around to help me with a shoulder massage.
5	1383350400	My husband works at a computer all day long doing data entry and then goes to school at night at a desk.  His shoulders are always as hard as a rock.  I'm not strong enough to massage those kind of solid knots out of his shoulder muscles.  But ever since we got this back buddy, he can use it to massage all those knots out every night.  Best of all: I don't have to do it.  He says it gets way deeper into the muscle than any masseuse has been able to get.  I whole-heartedly recommend this product for anyone with severe tense shoulder/back muscles.  :D
5	1383350400	It's amazing! Gets the knots out of my shoulders with ease, my parents came over, tried it out, went home and ordered one for themselves
5	1383350400	Second time purchasing one of these ((one for home and the other for the road)).LOVE it.If you have any kind of back issue (tightness, traveling, heavy lifting, bending or straining) this Back buddy serves as a travel accu-pressureist.Well made, durable. Can't imagine you'd ever have to replace it...worth the $30+
5	1383177600	Chronic pain sufferer, top of spine to bottom.  Do you ever ask your spouse or significant other to really get in there and they just can't quite do it?  Well, this will take care of that problem and you can do it on your own, anytime on any possible portion of your spine.  Simply amazing for pressure points in the foot and the traps as well.  What a great product.  Anyone skeptical, do not be.  If you, like myself, are always in pain, this is a must have at this price.
5	1383091200	Wasn't sure if this was a little silly. No, not silly. Serious. Good. Period. Buy it, you will not have a regret.
4	1383091200	I like this a lot...really dug into muscles and spots even my well trained the masseuse aren't fixing. It's easier to dig in myself with this tool...but I think I might've actually bruised my muscles..felt good at the time, but later I was sore. I love all the nob choices.
4	1383091200	It works well once you learn how to use it.  I bought it when I had a bad muscle pain under my shoulder.  Nothing could reach it but this awesome tool.  I know i am not using this to its potential so I am getting a book and so should you.
5	1383004800	This contraption has been a back saver. I had to go to the massage therapist to get the knots out before. So it has been a great money saver too. I would recommend it absolutely!
5	1382918400	This tool does exactly what I wanted it to do - trigger point release that eases muscle tension in shoulders.
5	1382832000	hits the spots and works wonders. just what i needed. better than those cheap metal and wooden ones. what a relief as i work the knots out.
4	1382659200	I really like using the backbuddy. It makes my shoulders feel much better after using it and im able to use a lot of pressure.
4	1382572800	it took me a while to get used to manoeuvring this but once i did, yup, it was a breeze to use. i found the knobs a little hard on my skin and they sometimes skid a little over my shirt &#8211; perhaps rubberised knobs for more comfort and precision?
5	1382572800	I'm glad I purchased this Body Back Buddy.  It really works as advertised.  It relieves pain spots easily where ever they may be.
5	1382572800	We are in love with this tool. I've been meaning to buy one for a long time and now that I finally have, we love using it. We're big believers in trigger points and it's great to have the Body Back Buddy to be able to reach those knots in hard to reach places. The options of using the round ball knob or the pointier one that supposed to simulate an elbow is really nice. You can easily control the pressure. I enjoy the extra knobs placed around the curved ends as sometimes when I'm hooking this over my shoulder or around my side, those extra knobs find another spot that needs some work. This tool has helped the tight parts in my shoulders feel much better and helped release my strained neck.I like the knobs on the one curved end that can be used for the back of your neck. I like the two knobs in the middle straight section that can be used on your back. Having all these great options is wonderful and it feels so good to work on releasing the trigger points even if some areas are tender.The only thing that I could maybe complain about is how the tool is made from molded plastic. My knobs in the center of the straight piece have slight ridges across the tops from the molding. So when I run sensitive skin over them, like the underside of my forearms, then the skin gets irritated. It isn't a big issue. Those knobs could be lightly sanded, or if I wear a longsleeved shirt to cover my forearms that helps protect them. In all we really love finally having this tool and I really don't know why I waited so long to get one.
5	1382486400	I tried the Theracane at my gym and after reading reviews I ended up buying the Body Back Buddy instead.  I love that it has so many more options than the Theracane to reach practically any spot I need.  It takes a while to figure out how to use it at first.  I wish it came with an instruction book to show you some common uses (the little book it comes with only shows some pictures).  It is pretty big and clunky though so it's hard to store.  It's also hard to pack for travel so it stays at home.  But overall, it's a great tool and everyone who tried it at our place ended up buying one too.
1	1382400000	Rather unsure if all the glowing reviews of this tool are astroturfing, or people figured out some way to use this that I didn't.  The product itself comes with a 'booklet' that tells you absolutely nothing about how to use the item; be prepared to play it, jabbing it into various parts of your body and seeing if it helps to relax them.  I had the product for about three weeks, during which I tried numerous positions, then returned it.  30+ dollars for a simple piece of plastic and no clear instructions?  You've got to be joking.
5	1382227200	I love this tool, it helps to reach those areas where I am unable to massage myself. It also digs in really deep so after a hard workout  I am really able to provide myself with some relief.
5	1382227200	I have a few friends with a theracane, and when my massage therapist and chiropractor recommended i get one of these I wanted to do some research.  I LOVE this product, and plan on getting some for my siblings for x-mas.  It allows me to work on my knots little by little each day and avoid a disaster.  The pressure point spots have been really helpful as well.
5	1382140800	I've seen similar products elsewhere, but the quality of this one is much better. Similar products have parts that screw together, but the Body Back Buddy is molded as one piece. Rigid and strong materials.The shape allows you to reach just about anywhere on your body and only requires a little resistance to relieve pressure on sore muscles.
5	1382140800	Love it!!!! Use it on consistent basis. Gets where the pain is where most contraptions cannot get to. Bad back.......buy it
4	1381708800	I sit at a desk all day and will admit I have poor posture.  I almost always have a soar neck or back and this device works wonders!  It is not quite as good as a deep tissue massage, but it is a close second!  I am so impressed with this item that I bought two (one for work, one for home) and I will be purchasing more as Xmas gifts!
5	1381708800	Had an earlier version until I saw and bought this one. MUCH more versatile, and I LOVE the smaller &#34;point contact&#34; head! GREAT for those small painful points!
5	1381622400	so its got these little knobby things that when you apply pressure massage you... its fricken sweet. if you are thinking of buying STAHPPPPPP!!!!! buy this NAOO!
5	1381536000	The body back buddy is great for my back, shoulder blades, shoulders, neck, and head.  I can work on each area as much or as little as needed.  I use it to help relieve and/or prevent chronic migraines.  My doctor recommended that I use it everyday.  I have not managed to do that, but I think if I did, it would really help relieve tension in the areas mentioned above and of course to help deal with migraines.  I would recommend the body back buddy to anyone who has a lot of stress in their lives and/or sits in front of a computer all day.  Even though I have not used it as such, I'm sure the body back buddy would be useful for many other areas of the body.
5	1381536000	The Body Back Buddy has helped out so much with my shoulders, throughout the day my shoulders always seem to get knots in them and having the deep muscle massage point is able to really focus in on the most tense area's. I've only had the Body Back Buddy for a little while and it has already paid for itself. I will say that it is kind of hard to use on the legs without getting really creative with how to position it and massage the tense area's well. Using it on the feet I think you should be careful because it feels like you're stepping on something and there's a natural response to try and pull your foot away.
4	1381536000	I am very pleased with this product. It allows me to target those knots that need deep pressure, and my husband loves that I don't whine to him anymore to dig into my shoulder blades! The only reason that I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it still can't beat a really good professional deep tissue massage.
5	1381449600	I drive alot, and I work at computers alot. arms outstretched all day long. my neck and shoulders kill me daily. This thing is a god send. My wife won't rub the knots out and I cannot afford a massage every day. this gets into the spot under my shoulder blades and I'm able to work out the ache in just a few minutes a day. I recommend this Back Buddy to everyone.
5	1380931200	Wooooow great .Recommend for every home.Even my little daughter enjoy playing with it.Many thanks for the best innovation.
5	1380844800	This aide is amazing....can release tension with little to no effort and i'm thrilled I bought it.  Will definitely need less trips to the massage therapist and chiropractor.  Well worth the money when i consider those savings.
5	1380672000	My husband and I like this, it gets the spots we can not reach or applies the pressure we can do not have the strength to do ourselves.
5	1380672000	I picked this up because I've got terrible knots, the worst of which are in my traps, where it's near impossible to get at by rolling on a ball. I can hook this baby around my torso and use the ball in the middle to really work the traps, while leveraging off my body to get more force by just hanging my arm from the handle. Easy and effective. It also helps with other hard-to-reach areas. Definitely recommended for anyone who has serious knots and can't afford to go to a massage therapist every other day.
3	1380672000	I purchased this item because it was recommended by my physical therapist. It is hard to hold and use because of its texture.
5	1380672000	Weird obscenely shaped device is the best combination back massager/back scratcher.  After hours of seated in front of the computer, nerve pressure from my ruptured discs can cause excruciating pain from muscle spasms.  The Back Buddy is amazing how pressure on the trigger can eliminate the pain.
2	1380585600	I returned this item because it made my back hurt worse. A tennis ball against the wall works better for me.I know this works for some people, but not me.
5	1380499200	My wife has scoliosis and has had back pain all her life. She uses it mostly as shown in the picture but it has provided much pain relief since we bought it. Just don't put it under the bed and forget it. You actually have to use it :)
5	1379980800	This contraption has relieved my trap & neck pain. I was suffering from compressed nerve; stretching and exercising were not relieving the pain. If you do it right, it feel like giving yourself a deep tissue massage. .I&#8217;ve had had it for a week and use it when I feel tightness or use it in the morning before work. I highly recommend it when you cannot get a massage and need instant relief.
5	1379980800	I have a new job and my neck and shoulders are in constant pain. This bbb is the best friend I even had. It works on my tired feet as well. It's really almost better than a massage.
2	1379894400	Let me start by saying that I don't have major back issues, but I do have sore spots every now and then that could benefit from some attention.I hoped this would bring the sweet relief i was looking for.  I was wrong.  I've found this very awkward to use and can't seem to figure out any way that it feels like it's doing any good.  Also, as immature as this is - the whole thing looks like a crazy adult toy.  I had it laying in my office and it definitely created a lot of uncomfortable stares.Anyways - seems that it must work for most people as the other reviews have been pretty amazing.  Guess i'm just the minority.good luck.
5	1379808000	This device allows me to rub a couple of nagging spots in my back.  No other device has worked so well.  It's great!
5	1379808000	This is amazing and really digs deep in the spots that others can't get. I had a popped rib that kept coming loose and popping back out. I was at the chiropractor almost every other day until I tried this. I was able to just put pressure on it and push it back in. Might sound gross, but it saved me $50 each trip to the doc. It works great on feet too. I set it on the ground and step on the end of it.
5	1379635200	This is the best purchase I have made in a long time.I have had chronic shoulder and neck pain and have been going to PT.The body back buddy has helped to enhance my neck exercises and also on days when I'm short on time to alleviate the pain after just a few minutes of working trigger spots.I am now trying to use it for back pain and can only hope it works as well there.Highly recommend this product.
4	1379548800	I can  get to places on my back that I never could with enough pressure to actually do some good
4	1379462400	It was a little difficult to figure out how to work with this, but it helps you reach the spots you can't get to with your hands.  It's a good tool, you just have to experiment until you get the hang of it.
5	1379376000	Great for my back thank you! I use it on a daily basis. It keeps me feeling good and moving better.
5	1379376000	A massage therapist recommended that I buy this and it is awesome.  This is the first tool that actually does the job for the knots in my shoulders and neck.  It is truly amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from back tight shoulders, neck and back pain.
4	1379289600	Among comparable tools, the Body Back Buddy is the most versatile and useful and handles best. You can reach pretty much every region of the body and apply controlled pressure using either the rounded or more pointed knobs, whichever feels better. However, I doubt that using it will get you very far without additional training to improve coordinated movement. There are many therapies that may help, from yoga to Feldenkrais. Unfortunately there's no sure-fire way to get rid of muscle pains, one needs to take the trouble to try what suits best.
4	1379116800	It actually works pretty well to get those spots in your back that you just can't reach otherwise. I'd still prefer to have a real massage, but this does okay in a pinch.
5	1378944000	I wish I had thought of this tool.  It is wonderful, very sturdy, provides good pressure and is very easy to use. I have been looking at these items for a while and I am very glad that I purchased this one.
5	1378944000	Use the back buddy usually before bed to help get the kinks out.  There's a booklet that shows you how to use all the knobs and get right into the pain spots.  Friends tried it and I ended up ordering a couple more for them.
5	1378944000	This is a really handy tool that reaches so many parts of your body.  I love the fact that it has different size massage tips depending on what you need/want.  I highly recommend this!!
5	1378684800	very effective at working out knots and helpful at pain relief- better than asking someone for  neck or back rub!
5	1378684800	My back feels real nice ;]Those curves , man oh man those curves. Makes me wanna dance all night!!!!
5	1378684800	I bought a body buddy for myself but every time my sons would come to visit they were constantly using it. So the one I purchased through Amazon was a gift for one of my sons. He absolutely loved it! I now have to purchase one for my other son. It sure beats the price of having a massage.
5	1378684800	It's perfect for those times when you have a knot in your back or shoulder that needs direct pressure to get the muscle to relax.  Great tool for the times when you don't want to bug your spouse for a quick massage. Ron.
5	1378339200	Ahhhhhhh!!  This is just what I needed to release my extremely tight neck, shoulder and back muscles.  I wish I knew about this earlier in my life.  It has helped me tremendously and whenever I need it.
5	1378252800	I love this back buddy. I've suffer from muscle pain in areas in the shoulder area and in the lower back, hip and thigh areas.  The Body Buddy gets to muscles that I have in the past struggled to reach. relieves the muscle tension in the shoulder area and even gives a great massage to the feet.
4	1378080000	Who ever invented this thing is a genius. I would get small knots in my back and have my wife try to rub them out but she never could get them out fully. This thing gets deep into the knot and releases them. I am a big guy and it even works well for me. The only thing is the neck bulbs are too close together for comfort for a bigger person, but I just use the other bulbs and its all good.
4	1377820800	I still gave it 4 starts even though the best relief for me is actual massage. I have had 2 major spine surgeries and tend to have a lot of &#34;knots&#34; and tension in my mid to lower scapular areas and my neck. This helps to reach those spots, apply pressure and give me some relief. It was actually recommended to me under a different brand by my physical therapist but based on the reviews I choose this one...
5	1377648000	This thing is a life saver.  This is best for people who carry tension in their shoulders and lower back.  I've used it on my hamstrings and neck and it helps reduce amount of visits to spa's
1	1377561600	The product information stated that the body back buddy came with a 12 page instruction manual. An inadequate pamphlet arrived with the product. The pamphlet indicated that instructions were on the company's website. Great, imagine my surprise when the company wanted to SELL me an instruction manual an CD! I am returning the product.
5	1377561600	Real Deal here if you have painful areas in your neck, shoulders and back! Get the recommended Trigger Point therapy book! They are perfect together! I am a RN and use this. The book is very easy to understand for non medical people. It teaches you to use this device in many different ways on trigger points. It is larger than theracane and has more pressure point knobs if you will. It is to me worth it for that reason. My massage therapist recommended it.
4	1377475200	Love the back body, but it did not come with the instruction book.  It was supose to come free with the order.  I had to go to Back Buddy and order it.  It wasn't free through them.
5	1377388800	So this product might take some time to get used to and a bit of learning how to use.  It does come with a guide which helps.  I honestly couldn't believe how much I love this product.  At first it was awkward and the hard plastic took me a some time to get used to but once I did, I was delightfully surprised how well it works.  Sure there is some pain but it would be the same if I had someone else find those painful trigger points.  The best thing is that I don't need other people.  With this product I can take care of my own trigger points and can get those very hard to reach spots on my back.  Once I learned how gentle or hard I could put the pressure, I learned that using this often I wasn't having the problems I used to.  I even can use it while on the computer or watching tv.  So easy to find those spots that are giving me problems and then release the tension with this.  I highly recommend the Body Back Buddy.
4	1377302400	This item is a little bit more flexible and less stiff than the Thera-Cane, which I used at a physical therapy gym.  It's still plenty strong enough for me and I would not categorize it as flimsy, but it's possible that a particularly large and strong person might want the stiffer item.  I am a short woman, moderately overweight, and the device is just right for me.The reason I got the Body Back Buddy instead of the Thera-Cane was for the extra knobs, especially the pair that are positioned for getting pressure points on both sides of the neck at once.  That works just as I hoped it would and is very helpful for neck pain.  I was also impressed with the two wider-spaced knobs near the middle of the device, which were more effective than I thought they would be for getting the muscles on both sides of the spine in the lower back.So overall I'm very pleased with the product and it's probably worth five stars for myself.  But there's a fairly large segment of the population (men above average size and strength, and very heavy people of either gender) that might find it a little too small or too flexible, so that's why I docked a star.
5	1377302400	That is what I searched and this item was at the top of the list. If you are dissatisfied with your massage then you are doing it wrong.
4	1377302400	My husband loves this product, he is able to reach all of the knots in his back now. He uses it everyday.
5	1377129600	I first saw one of these at my physical therapist's office where I was being treated for recurring migraines. I told her it looked like a martial arts weapon because it does! But it performs some great Kung Fu on those knots I get in my my trapezius muscles. There's just no comparison between trying to work those knots out with my fingers vs the knobs on the BBB--this gizmo makes it so much easier to both reach and apply enough pressure to those knots. It's very sturdy and versatile. I like that there are different sizes and shapes to work with because some knots seem to require different angles to work on them properly. I won't say that this device was solely responsible for my migraines going away (THAT required a number of habit changes and exercises) but it was definitely critical in working out knots before they could start any of the headaches that often progressed to migraines for me.
5	1376956800	I wish I had known about this 2 years ago.I also wished a Dr had recommend it. I use thisTo help me with my muscle spasms in my back. EasyTo use and easy to reach those tough spots. Buy itYou won't regret it!
5	1376870400	Amazing product - you barely need any pressure to really dig deep into the muscle because of the leverage you can get the way the S curve is designed. I've been looking for a good tool for deep tissue massage and trigger point therapy, and this has been amazing so far.
5	1376697600	Sometimes you just need knots worked out of your back, and trying to massage them yourself often puts you in awkward positions that make the pain worse. However with this handy tool, you keep your body in perfect posture and can relieve your pain easily. Great for people who need everyday knot massaging or for people that don't have access to another person to massage them. This product is used daily in my household. It is better than a lot of other products because of the many knots and bulbs around the hooks as well as the perfectly positioned hand holds. The quality is great, it is sturdy and has made cross continental journeys and still looks brand new. Perfectly reaches shoulder and back pain from any angle no matter where the pain in on your back, it can probably reach it and massage it out.
5	1376524800	Most reviewers have said it all, but I'll post a few thoughts.My only small concern before buying this was that one may have to have some"background" on trigger points, and self-massage, as it seemed that one hasto use it in a certain way to make it effective. However it is straightforwardto use it by listening to your body and press here and there. Explore yourback, find that knot/trigger point, and let the journey to the pleasure landbegin!I have been using it for only a few days, and my back pain is way better (I amspending lots of hours on my desk). I already cannot imagine a day in the officewithout it.As another person said, the only disadvantage is that it is not exactlytravel-friendly, nor you can put it in your regular-sized student backpack.On the other hand, I feel that if it was constructed to fold/unscrew, etc,it wouldn't feel as sturdy as it feels now.I am not familiar with many other self-massage tools, but I bet it can't gettoo much better than that, at least considering back pain. If you have backissues, do yourself a favor and buy one of these.
4	1376524800	I like this product, It does help when you get a knot in the middle of the night and have no one to help work it out for you. I wish it were a little more rigid though, but defiantly not bad at all.
5	1376265600	Being a long time advocate of trigger point release, I'm glad I purchased the Body Back Buddy.  I am no longer frustrated with trying to position baseballs, softballs, golf and tennis balls, foam rollers, etc... on various parts of my body.  And, I longer search for wall corners or door frames on which to rub my back and shoulder blades. The Body Back Buddy is well designed with properly positioned and shaped knobs.  It allow me to work the knotted/trigger point areas that I have been unable to in the past. A key feature for me is that I think it is strongly built and I feel confident I can apply a significant amount of pressure without fear of it breaking.  For you folks who get stiff necks and burning shoulder muscles from spending too much time hunched over a computer or a  work surface, I highly recommend the Body Back Buddy.  I keep mine next to my desk and use  it several times a day.  I have fewer headaches and a lot less shoulder pain.
5	1376265600	This product is nice becuase it has so many different options for different pressure points on the body.  IT comes with an instructional booklet too!
5	1376179200	It's really funny looking, my boyfriend makes fun of me for using it.  Don't let the look scare you! This thing rocks! My brother recommended it to me, for a person that works out a lot, I have a lot of sore and tight muscles.  The BBB gives a deep tissue massage, a must have, I think, if you tend to get a lot of tight muscles.
5	1376092800	As a massage therapist this is a must have in my studio for self care and I recommend my clients get one!
2	1376006400	Don't know why I thought I would like this product.  It's too hard to get a decent amount of pressure, and you just feel awkward moving it around to get into position.
5	1375920000	This comes in handy when you have a pressure point pain that you need to work out. The booklet that comes with it shows how to use it to get to different back pain areas.
5	1375833600	ahh, man.  this thing works better than the automatic chair massager.  Reminds me of a professional deep tissue massage.  highly recommended for people who need to get a knot out, but cant get to a place that gives clinical-grade massages.
5	1375833600	After several back surgeries, I was attending a pain management clinic and several physical therapists recommended this tool.  There are different models but this one specifically can address various body parts.  So far, I have only used it to attack muscle spasms in my shoulder blades but it has potential to do much more.  I only wish I'd discovered the back buddy years ago.  It comes with written instructions and an optional CD.  I did not purchase the CD as I already knew how to use it.  I plan to look for online videos to learn different techniques.  The Back Buddy is easy to use and very successful providing relief.
4	1375660800	The stems on this are pretty hard so you have to be careful not to go too crazy when trying to massage your own back.  There is no way this thing would ever break.  It's tough, but it would be better with some type of padding on the ends....just a little.
5	1375574400	Our son bought one for us for Christmas, 2012 and we loved it so much, we considered having one at home and one in the car for our frequent trips to see family. We bought this one for my dad who fell and broke his back a few years ago. We knew it would help with any pain anywhere on his back or neck. This is fabulous for people who don't believe or want or can't afford to see a chiropractor. You decide how much pressure to use and how long to hold the &#34;Buddy.&#34; It works, it helps break up the knots.
5	1375574400	My husband found out about this through a co worker and decided to give try. He loves it! He finds immediate relief from back pain after using.
4	1375488000	I bought this for my husband's birthday since his back always hurts. A friend of mine recommended it since she always has knots on her back. They both like it, although my husband says it doesn't beat a regular massage.
5	1375488000	Just a little pain for a short time relieves a lot a pain for a long time. I WOULD RECOMMEND.
5	1375401600	I never bother writing reviews, even for products which I love, but this will actually make your day to day life more comfortable.  My neck and upper back (around the shoulder blades) have been chronically stiff/sore/etc for probably 6-7 years now (i'm only 30), and its a rare day when i'm feeling 100% comfortable and limber.  Usually there is always a small tweak somewhere in my upper neck/back area.  Just to clarify, i'm not in chronic pain or anything like that, just a nagging stiffness that rarely goes away, sometimes caused by infrequent exercise, stress, sitting at a desk all day, or just a bad pillow.Now, the product - I got it 3 days ago.  The first night, I used it for probably a solid 30-40 mins, the next night, another 15 minutes.  Today, my neck is more limber and flexible than it has been in several months at least.  If I can feel this way just by using this thing for 10-15 mins every day while I sit on the couch, that will be nothing short of miraculous.  Yea, the first couple days you'll feel some soreness in the muscle (not to be confused with stiffness), but that's to be expected when you're really digging into your shoulder blade or neck.A massage takes longer and will probably cost $60+.  Yes, a massage is more luxurious and "relaxing", but honestly, this tool is better at getting those knots out, because you can find the EXACT spot and really dig into it hard until it loosens up.  Its hard to explain the exact spot to a masseuse in the same way...Finally, it doesn't take much strength at all to exert a LOT of pressure right where you need it. I'm 5'9", 160lbs, so i'm fit, but not a huge guy, and i barely need to apply any force to get some serious spot pressure.BOTTOM LINE: if you're someone who has frequent neck/back stiffness, YOU NEED THIS!!!
5	1375401600	Just an amazing product!! Got it in on Monday and was already exciting to use it from all the 5star reviews I read on here. I'm in the tire business. I change big farm tire, transport tires, forklift and bobcat tire etc.. Its a hard job and takes a toll on your body over the last 8 years. I also golf 2-3 a week.Started getting back pain 2-3 years ago and it get kind of depressing. watching up in pain every day and feeling so helpless and limited to do anything. Started going to chiro's, that's a ripped off. Then started getting massages over the years. honestly will all the money I spend over time was probably 2000-3000$. It all adds up. Bought the Dr Ho thing too, ripped off. Just felt like I needed a massage daily and was always beat up. Also have an inversion table. great for stretching, but the knots are still there.This product hands down is just unreal. First night I used it for like 2 hours. Hurt so good. you know what I'm saying. My left shoulder and neck and back is so loose right now and the right side is coming long too. Hasn't felt so good in years. This is after using it on Monday and Tuesday night. Feels like I just got 5 hours of a hard powerful massage.Cant wait till after a month. Awesome I can keeps these monster knots away for good now. Dream come true. Wish I found this years ago. would be richer and looser lol. Also love how you control the pressure and target the right places in seconds.Life changing product. every household should own one. I'm preacher about the back buddy. Best back product on the market hand down.5 out of 5
5	1375401600	My bf is 6'4, 240 and I am 5'6, 135 and we both get great use of this product, it has so many different angles and ways to use it, it works for a wide range of sizes and physical needs.  Who'd have thought a piece of molded plastic would be so expensive though, and actually worth it??
5	1375315200	Got this for my mom who has a pinched nerve in her neck. Basically this thing helps you reach the pressure points on your back and sides, legs too I guess. Her physical therapist used one on her in sessions and recommended we get one for her at home. You don't really rub or massage with this, you find the pressure point and pull or push on the plastic wand (?), stick (?), curved thing to push gently on the hurting part. It comes with a chart of pressure points, but you should probably only use this if you had someone show you how to use it to start with.One perk I guess is that since this is plastic, you should be able to travel with it on a plane. That's why my mom's therapist told her. Not sure if the TSA would get you, but if you have issues sitting in a plane it makes sense you'd want to bring it along - on road trips too I suppose.If the Amazon photos are still up, you can see that the shape of this thing makes sense as the model is using the item to put pressure on a point midway down her back, impossible to do if you are by yourself! My mom puts the curved part around the back of her neck and it has 2 knobs that reach right where her nerve pain is, so she just kind of sits there with this wrapped around her.I think it's worth a try for those who know what their issues are. I can easily imagine someone buying this and getting frustrated with it if they don't know how to properly use it.
5	1375228800	A great tool to finding the trigger points and massaging the muscles that are intertwined in compression. I recommended to anyone who can hit those spots.
5	1375228800	This has made a big difference in my back. I haven't even had it 24 hours yet. It was the best $35 I've spent in a while. It's able to get those trigger points/muscle knots out that only my massage therapist can get. Its much cheaper as well... If you have back pain BUY this. I've had such a huge improvement after having to take prescription anti-inflammatory medication. I'll update this after some time has passed to see if the results stick.
5	1375142400	This is an amazing product. When I first brought it home, my mom who is a nurse exclaimed excitedly &#34;Oooooh! You got one of these things! I love this thing!&#34; I guess she had used it before, said she gave one to her sister who had back problems 20 years ago, and a nurse she was working with just last week had one, who loved it and was showing it off. I had no idea my mom would even know what it was when I brought it home. My wife (who I live apart from due to job) got one first and she had been using it every day after being recommended it by a professional full-time massage therapist in town. So I couldn't try it before buying one for myself, I just went off her word.About my experience with it now:I'm a 230lb muscle-bound guy, so before ordering it I was skeptical since it has no moving parts and is just what appears to be either rigid plastic or fiberglass. However I have begun using it every day. I put heavy pressure on it, and while it flexes slightly I have zero worry of it bending or breaking. You can exert the exact pressure you need on a knotted muscle to loosen it up. I have knotted muscles I didn't even realize were knotted. I knew I had a degenerative spinal condition in my neck from when a disk slipped so my muscles began to build up on one side of my neck in response to the loosened ligament. This allows me to put enough pressure on super built-up and tight muscles, to RE-TRAIN them. It has INSTANTLY made a huge difference in the posture of my neck and spine. I can actually locate the specific muscles that have tightened in response to loosen them back up, which allows my neck to be adjusted into it's natural position. At first, loosening up my knotted muscles made them extremely sore for days. But when I kept working at them they get looser and looser into a more natural shape/tightness. It hasn't been that long, but this $35 tool is worth a $500 massage package easily, especially since it can be done in the privacy of your own home for those of you who are introverts like myself, or the many of us who have body-image issues.This is the best $35 I have spent in a long time, and it's the only thing I've been able to use and exert enough pressure with to actually loosen the muscles in my neck. I have tried the electronic neck rollers from the 80's-90's and they never worked. I have tried hand-massages which didn't work. I tried getting it adjusted at chiropractors costing hundreds. I tried $150 muscle stimulation devices. I tried $100 cervical traction pillows. This $35 tool has done what all of those other things combined could not do. I now have a glimmer of hope that my neck condition may not lead to permanent arthritis once the muscles are fully re-trained.
5	1374969600	Awesome product, really works!  I still haven't figured out how to use all the various knobs, but it has still helped me tremendously.  I've been suffering with back pain for over two years from a car accident and have tried everything from physical therapy and chiropractic to acupuncture.  While my back has been getting gradually better over time, the Back Buddy has really made a big difference.  I also got the Backnobber II for travel and to keep at work. It also works great, though I like the Back Buddy just a bit more (feel like I get better leverage).  The only downside to the Back Buddy is the pamphlet that came with it wasn't very informative, but the booklet that came with the Backnobber was great.
5	1374796800	I bought this for my husband who suffers from chronic back pain on the recommendation from a friend who was already using one. It does help to get to problem areas for temporary relief.
5	1374796800	Easy to use, provides lots of relief from stiff muscles. Almost as good as a massage. I have only used it one way so far, but I love that there are so many knobs and ways to use it. Highly recommended.
5	1374624000	i get regular deep tissue massages every 2 months or so due to lower back issues, and overall muscle tightness that i get from working out and doing things like yard work. My therapist suggested getting something like the theracane or this for the time between massages, and you know what, she's cost herself some revenue, because this thing is so good, i've started going to her less.if you get deep tissue massages, and you feel that the kind of pressure - getting an elbow stuck in the knotted muscle for example - works for you, then this will work for you as long as you're willing to do it.  if massages don't do anything for you, then this won't and it's no fault of the device.  Don't expect this thing to be a miracle maker.i use it on my lower back, upper back, neck, shoulder, upper glute/hip area.. it works great.  wish there was a way to fold it so i could more easily take it on trips with me, but aside from that, it's worth every penny.  Considering that a massage is $100+ from a good therapist, this is a bargain.
5	1374537600	This thing works great!  It's very stiff and has lots of different knobs and tons of ways to use it.  Easy to get the neck, shoulders, mid and lower back, thighs, glutes and feet.  Way more options than the theracane, it's not even close.  The only downside is that it's a bit bulkier.  Worth every cent.
5	1374451200	I've only had the back buddy for 1 week and I've already gotten my moneys worth! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to give themselves a back massage anytime they feel tense. I first tried a product similar to this one at a friends house (it only had 2 knobs- one at each end of the 'S' shape) and this one is definitely better! There are so many ways you can use this product to massage your neck, upper back, shoulders, lower back, legs, and feet- it's awesome. The back buddy even comes with a little booklet that describes how to use it and even provides pictures of the different ways it can be used.
4	1374451200	I can now massage parts of my body that is difficult to reach or apply pressure. would be nice if the material on the pressure point is softer.
4	1374019200	I am a massage therapist, and keep this handy to use after each session. It's easy to get to those shoulder spots, and I've been able to work out those pesky trigger points along the IT band. (which hurts like blazes during the process, but then it's GONE!)My family draws names for Christmas, and I gave 2 of these. When my sister tried to walk off with our brother's BBB, I knew that her birthday would have to include one of these babies.Every house should have one of these. You won't be sorry, but you might have to draw straws over who uses it first.
5	1373932800	I enjoyed this so much that surprised my girlfriend with one.  She absolutely loves it too.  Now that she has her own, I can save my fingers a little from giving her back and neck massages.  Outstanding product.I highly recommend using lotion or a gel with this product as the friction my damage the skin.
5	1373846400	I can really &#34;get-a-hold&#34; of my muscle knots now!  Controlling the pressure is easy.  I use it one day then wait two to keep from being sore, but it has significantly improved my problem.
5	1373760000	My wife and I used to have to push our elbows into each others backs, which can be a tiring and thankless effort when the other has real tough knots. This baby allows us to take care of our own back knots. Well worth the money!
5	1373673600	Ah, finally, to be able to get exactly the right spot, when I need it, without an expensive and time consuming massage appointment.  If you have persistent knots or spasms, you need one of these.  Very fast shipment (to Hawaii no less) and good strong product.
5	1373673600	Bought for my 86 year old mother-in-law.  She has many &#34;owie&#34; areas that are heard to reach with her hands.  She loves this.  Says it really massages her muscles well, is easy to use, and it works.
5	1373587200	My wife has known about this device for years - she used to work in admissions for a massage therapy school and they all swore by it, but apparently figured I would not be interested.  Finally I remarked the other day, "If I just had something I could lean against - I could break up these knots in my back" and for some reason that clicked for her.  She pointed it out on Amazon - it looked promising so for $35 I gave it a try.Yesterday it arrived and I immediately used it to wail on the knots in my shoulder blades, back and neck muscles.  I'm kind of a big guy (6'2/210lb) and it takes a fair bit of pressure to break up knots in my back, but leaning against this device in an office chair - it's very easy to apply as much force as you can bear, exactly where you want it with little effort.In 10 minutes I had loosened even the deepest muscle spasms and was in a world less pain.  The next day now I still feel much better and my plan is to use it every day to keep things in check.  I love it!  And now I have an inexpensive, generic gift idea I can use for almost any occasion too!
4	1373587200	Versatile and very sturdy. I especially like the two knobs that fit the neck perfectly--great for putting pressure on the back of the head/neck.
5	1373328000	This is a great massage yourself tool. I can hit the trigger points in my back and I use it when I just feel a little sore too. It is a great product at about half the price of a massage.
5	1373241600	I purchased a regular Theracane several years ago and misplaced it in a move. This replacement is great.  It does much more than the standard Theracane.
5	1373241600	This really hits the sore areas to relieve painful spots,  this was recommended by my physical therapist .  It is good for fibromyalgia
4	1373155200	very useful, i like it a lot. little bit hard to storage sometime because of its size are little big
5	1373068800	My physical therapist recommended this for me and it has been amazing at working out the knots in my back and neck!
5	1372982400	Until now, I did not think I can massage my back pressure point or stress knots by myself. This products is awesome and you don't need to depend on your wife to do it for you! :) Great product.
5	1372809600	Love this thing.  Everyone in my house now borrows it because it works so well.  Relieve the knots in your back and neck.  It's also easy to hook it on a computer chair so that you can massage your back while working, hands free.
5	1372723200	I can't afford to go get a massage as often as I'd like and my husband's fingers get tired quickly. I love deep tissue massages & this product solves all my problems. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that likes deep tissue.
5	1372723200	I've had my back buddy for over a year.  If you want to get the most out of your back buddy, you should get The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook by Clair Davies.  I've had chronic neck/shoulder pain from a car accident and typing with my job for over 20 years. I've also had terrible left plantar fasciitis. With physical therapy and chiropractic care, I've had some temporary relief, but I've had more success using the back buddy on my trigger points.  I went to a podiatrist who was eager for me to have surgery for plantar fasciitis after physical therapy failed, but thankfully, using my back buddy on my trigger points and changing physical therapists, I no longer have plantar fasciitis pain.  I was more than happy to tell my podiatrist that I no longer needed her services!  I believe the key is finding a PT who will show you your trigger points and how to manipulate them safely to get the most benefit from you back buddy, which is what I did.  If you have acute or chronic pain, take the time to educate yourself before using the back buddy on your body.  I am very grateful for the back buddy and the trigger point workbook.  The back buddy exceeds my expectations!
4	1372636800	Reaches those hard to get spots! Works well, allows me to loosen those tight spots. Be careful not to press too hard, you'll leave a sore spot.
5	1372636800	I have not used this very much as it will take a little time to learn how to use it. I advise buying the DVD along with it.
5	1372636800	I don't know why I put off buying this for so long, because I have used it at least once a day since it arrived at my home! I have a lot of chronic myofascial adhesions and trigger points and the body back buddy is giving me some much needed relief.
5	1372550400	This is a must have for every home.  Get a muscle knot we all do, maybe its hard to reach or cant get someone to rub it out for you this tool REALLY WORKS.  It makes quick work of those knots.
4	1372377600	Have one at work and at home, it's the masseuse you need without the added cost and relieves knots/tense muscles quite fast. It looks funny hanging on the coat rack but who cares!
5	1372204800	I bought one for each of the men in my life for Christmas. As soon as they were unwrapped, all of them were massaging their shoulders and moaning with pleasure. All of the Back Buddies are still in good shape. It's a good, strong design.
5	1372204800	I am a sign language interpreter and my scapulae always have knots in them.  This works great for getting those painful knots out in between my biweekly massages, but it doesn't replace my massages. I would definitely recommend this product.
1	1372204800	My fingers are much better at relieving muscle pain than this giant, plastic thing, that I'm finding hard to store and use.
4	1372118400	This was purchased for my sister who had surgery on her lympnodes and was having trouble with her arm and shoulder muscles. After physical therapy she was told to purchase a body buddy in order to keep her muscles loose and prevent the arm from tightening back up. She is very happy at how easy it is to use and is having success in keeping her back and neck muscles mobile.
3	1372118400	Overpriced and not easy to use. Difficult to manage and control. My wife said an umbrella would work just as we'll.
5	1372032000	I get a lot knots in my upper middle back that are really hard to work out and can painfully continue with days on end. This tool is the only thing I've found that can actually get in there and break them up.
4	1371945600	I ordered the Body Back Buddy because I could not reach a very painful strain at the lower inside of my shoulder blade.  live alone, and I could not seem to relieve the pain with my &#34;normal fixes&#34;.  I got a recommendation for the Body Back Buddy and bought it.  It was very helpful, but it is high priced for the content.
3	1371772800	My wife loves this thing and I just like it.  Does a great job at getting at hard to reach places and has a good instruction manual.  My only concern is that I am 6'4&#34; and 240lbs so the U curves barely fit around my shoulder and mid section.  I don't think I'd change the design as it works for most but it was a concern for me.  Review based on my usefulness of the product.  If I were average sized I could easily give this a 3.5 or 4.
5	1371772800	I have tried many different products over the years that would relieve my shoulder and neck pain but then within 5 minutes after using it the pain was back.  If you want to get to the root of the pain the &#34;Body Back Buddy&#34; is for you!! It took just a couple of times to determine the most effective position for my pain. The booklet explains the different pressure points and I can tell using it daily is going to give me long term results!  A++++ product & quick shipping!!!!
4	1371772800	I have tried it and it is a little odd, but it does hit the spots that are knotted. Anything that helps gets out those shoulder knots is worth a try.
4	1371340800	If wife is happy, life is happy.Has a number of ways to use it on all unreachable body parts.
4	1371254400	It may look like something out of a scary back street sex shop but this product works very well, especially for the hard to reach areas. You have to make sure to use it correctly, it's not for &#34;massaging&#34; its more for applying pressure to a direct spot with some slight movement to loosen up the muscle.
5	1371081600	Received this as a gift and everyone had to try it.  Then bought another for my sister for a birthday gift. Both of us have osteoarthritis and it is helpful on many parts of the body.  Original buyer of gift saw it being used by people in a call center to relieve back stiffness.
5	1370995200	I received this as a gift for my back, and it has worked so well to alleviate pain in my upper back around my shoulder blades, neck and upper spine.  I also received the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook which has been very informative and helpful.
5	1370822400	I should buy another one for work... This thing looks funny with all the little knobs but get creative you can use this to massage or apply pressure to anywhere - neck, arms,feet.. My favorite is right between the spine and shoulder blade...ahh heaven
4	1370736000	I got this on the recommendation of a masseuse. I had some major issues going on in my back that were pretty chronic and would act up every so often. Well, the first night I got this I spent two hours digging it into the sore spots on my back. It felt so painfully good. But I paid for it the next few days because I think I bruised the muscles I was rubbing. So I suggest using it with caution and not digging it into one area for too long. But otherwise, I like it because i don't have to depend on hubby to get those spots that I can't reach.
5	1370736000	AND it saves my thumbs and hands from getting achy.  Don't get me wrong I like to rub my wife's back but sometimes my hands get achy.  She can now get the hard to reach spots AND put the pressure right where she wants it.
5	1370649600	This product is great for several reasons. When someone else is giving you a massage, they do not know exactly where to do it. Also, you might need so much pressure that they are afraid of hurting you. Plus, I think the BBB is less tiring for the sure than for someone giving a massage. Finally, there is not always a person around. If you wake up with a kink in your neck, the ability to work it out for 10 minutes in the morning and function normally (instead of having a splitting headache all day) is pretty much worth the price to me. I can compare it a little bit to the theracane.Though it seems like it would be cheaper to make a piece of plastic rather than the fiberglass impregnated theracane, I still think this is at a reasonable price point. It bends much less, and makes me less afraid of breaking it than the theracane. Also, some of my favorite knobs are the &#34;neck knobs&#34; which the theracane simply does not have.
5	1370390400	IT  CAME FAST THE  IT REALLY WORKS  GREAT.  MY PT  LADY TOLD ME TO GET ONE. SINCE THE  BCN  IS  STINGY ON  THE AMOUNT OF PT  THEY WILL ALLOW  AFTER A  SHOULDER  ''''REPLACEMENT'''.  I  BOUGHT THE  BODY  BACK  BUDDY TO HELP  ME SINCE MY  PT  ENDED  WAY  TOOOOOOO  SOON.  THANKS  .
5	1370390400	It took me about two days to find the way to use it. Once I knew how it works...I was blown away! It hit the spots that I could never en asking my reach myself and even asking my husband to massage certain spots wouldn't release the tension I get from sitting down so much at work.
5	1370390400	The Body Back Buddy is essential for anyone with back/neck issues. The use is pretty intuitive and I've found it to be a great help for working out knots or just putting some pressure on places that hurt. The design makes it easy to get to any problem area on your back (and I'm a pretty big dude, so smaller peeps won't have any problems).The hardest part about owning this product is explaining it to people when they come over and see it sitting in the living room. Just calmly explain that, no those are not small dildo attachments...they're just shaped that way to help relive some stress...you'll do fine!
5	1370304000	Quick delivery, arrived earlier than expected, which was perfect for my needs. I am still learning how to use this product. Works for my needs. The beauty of this is that you don't have to be lying down to use this product. Has come in handy for those hard to reach trigger/pressure points. Sturdy product and well made. Comes with an instruction card and information where to get more information about the product. Highly recommend this product.
4	1370217600	All my co-workers swear by this product. I have upper right muscle tension and I use the Body Back Buddy when I'm in a lot of discomfort. But it isn't long term relief.
4	1370131200	This item works as described. Hits pressure points and is easy to use. Eases muscle cramps and the like. Good.
5	1370044800	Wish I had purchased this 15 years ago when I started having problems with my back, does an excellent job of providing the right amount of pressure in just the right spots.
5	1370044800	I was slightly hesitant to buy having read one review saying it felt flimsy but I completely disagree with that and am glad I got it.  It's made of out really solid plastic and I can't imagine being able to break it.Anyway, I work on the computer most of the day and this is great for getting relieving the tension points in my neck and shoulders.  The one thing I didn't expect is that my kids (both around 20) love it too.  My daughter used it after working a few hours in the garden and it totally helped with her lower back ache.  BTW, I'm 6' 2&#34;, she is 5' 2&#34;, so it seems to work across a variety of heights.  I don't know if it would make a difference, but we're about normal weight.
5	1369872000	Then you will know that this exactly what the product is suppose to be. Those reviews that talk about the quality or what is made of I assuming have not used one of these devices before. It works great relieves knots in your back and neck. Yes it is made of plastic but it is durable.
4	1369872000	I've been going to a chiropractor AND massage therapist for shoulder issues for awhile now, and the 'BBB' has helped me avoid having to go back since I purchased it!
5	1369785600	Wow ! thanks to the massage therapist who invented the Body Back...it works great.  I just started working out and lifting weightsand being single with no budget for personal massage therapist on a regular basis, the BBB is exactly what I needed to relieve sore and tight muscles in hard to reach areas of the back.  All the pressure point nodules are shaped just right.  This tool really delivers.  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend !
5	1369785600	This works great.  Helping a ton with my upper back spasms.  Also been using it in shoulders and neck... it really seems to help release muscle tension.
5	1369699200	The back buddy is amazing! I use this whenever I have any type of muscular issue. From back therapy to your legs, feet, and anywhere else you can think of this thing does the job. I've intoduced it to several of my friends and they now stop by just to use the back buddy for a couple minutes. BUY ONE TODAY!
5	1369699200	This is, hands down, one of THE BEST purchases I have made in my entire life.Oh, I have a little soreness in my lower back after surfing? NO FREAKING PROBLEM!!!! Let me just get out my FLIPPIN AMAZING BODY BACK BUDDY and gently massage out the knot. If that doesn't work, NO FREAKING PROBLEMM!!! Put a little more pressure with this bad boy an you'll be FOREVER LIMBER AND HEALED. If you cramp up again or are not healed BRING OUT THE BODY BACK BUDDY and let the knot busting begin.In all honesty I'm a new man because of this oddly shaped contraption, and yes, THE POINTY END WILL MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH... SKEPTICALLY... No problem though, JUST STAB THEM IN THE GUT then massage away their pain.
5	1369440000	Every office should have one of these!  Really effective for doing trigger point work on yourself.  I've used the Theracane as well, but prefer this one as it has different shaped nobs and nobs for specifically targeting your neck.
1	1369353600	I thought that this would help when I saw how many edges, balls and stuff it had.i was wrong, it's over engineered. The instructions are half assed (whether you get the manual or not) and there are certain parts of your boy you can't reach or massage, like your chest, the sizes and proportions just don't work for me.The decisive factor for me is when I went to their site and watch the preview of their DVD. It says to use circular motion, that's against what I've researched, found in books and talked to about actual massage therapists when it comes to treating trigger points. Never go back and forth or circular with trigger points. Also, the product just feels rushed.I'll give it 2 because it got me started but I'm moving on.Update:They charge you for the shipment of the return. That means I had to pay for the shipment from their warehouse to my address and back. They say it's because it's not their fault. I'm never using this company again. I'm downgrading to 1 star.
5	1369267200	This works great. Nothing will beat an actual massage, however, this is a much cheaper alternative. Just find a pressure point, use this back buddy, and work it out. Very enjoyable.
5	1369267200	Love it!  Keep it at work!!  Would recommend to others with neck and back pain to try one of these.
3	1369267200	I had a similar product about 8 years ago.  I wish I still had it.  This is okay, but the plastic feels terrible.  It is sooooo light weight.  I prefer something heavier.  It's a really cheaply made product. That being said - if you are frail or weak from illness or injury, this thing is very light, and would probably be a good choice.
5	1369180800	I really wish I'd bought one of these years ago.  It's fabulous and I can really target all of the knots in my shoulder, neck, and back.  A must have!
5	1369180800	I have used a theracane before, and it is a little sturdier than this product, but that would be my only criticism.  This has way more functionality with all the knobs on it.  I also think the reviews criticizing its size are unfair.  I am 6'2&#34; 230 lbs with a 36&#34; waistline, so I am not a small person, and I can work the large end around my frame just fine.  It just takes a little thought and experience.  I highly recommend this product.
4	1368748800	Still learning how to use it.  It is handy!  Needs some getting used to.  I would recomend this product to my friends and family.
5	1368748800	This Body Buddy really works well. It's just as good as the other more expensive models out on the market. This cain works well to get those hard to reach trigger points on your back. I've been using this for years.
5	1368748800	I have severe pain in neck and shoulders and I've had to wait to arrange an MD visit for evaluation.  I ordered this to attempt to work out the tripper points in my back that I cannot reach.  It's well designed.  Will take practice to gain the skill to use it effectively, but; has already been helpful.  Sturdy plastic that should hold up well.
4	1368576000	I have a knot that shows up in my neck now and then and no (it's not from my wife) I sleep wrong and it shows up. This dewhicky of a device really helped me work out that knot, The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the price is a little high for a hard plastic shaped device, should be more like 25$
5	1368403200	Who ever created this device put a lot of thought into the design and the location of the knobs. The most expensive piece of plastic I've probably ever purchased, but worth the cost. It's good for loosening sore trigger points. Not as a good as a massage of course but still helpful.
5	1367884800	This item is awesome!! I have had to pay for deep tissue massages for years. This lets me do the deep tissue massage to my shoulders all by myself, also allowing me to put just the right amount of pressure on each spot. I can just sit here and use it while watching TV. It already has made a big difference in my shoulders, and I have saved a fortune on massages!! What can I say?? I LOVE IT!!
3	1367712000	Have not figured out exactly how to use. A little tricky getting in to positing. Still need to work with it more.
5	1367539200	I tried my friend's Back Buddy years ago and got this after I had a shiatsu massage, because even after the massage, I still had some knots in my shoulders. It works great. There is one knob that turns in for deep tissue.I have been keeping this at my desk. My co-workers give me grief because it is funny looking, but then they try it and are converted. I'd like to get two for both home and office.
5	1367539200	This product is great!  It serves its purpose more than adequately.  My friends who have used mine were extremely impressed.
4	1367452800	All 5 of these similar items work the same, though this one has more knobs than any others.  I'd have gladly paid an extra few bucks to see a physical therapist demonstrating how to use these in the most effective way on a DVD.  Hot showers REALLY make a difference BEFORE a session with the Back Buddy, and that little optional pressure point hook that adds $5 to the price of the item is well worth it, since it easily fits in a desk drawer and is less conspicuous.  For lowback sufferers, there's no way to use this discretely, go out to your car at lunch break, open the doors, and you can lie down to get into the right positions to get at those deep spots, lying on the floor between desks on the job probably not recommended.  The Theracane just jumped in price for some weird reason (Really,like doubled) which is an insult considering there's about 10 cents of polystyrene to make one.  Don't try this on your own, the position of those knobs is important, don't buy a piece of PVC and heat it up to bend it thinking you'll save $30, not worth it.  I agree with others, the ones that separate into 2 pieces are nice since they'll fit under a carseat or in a file cabinet drawer.  Altogether, I'd strongly recommend these to people with recurrent trigger points, assuming you can't have a massage therapist follow you around.  Remember, though, this is just part of a home exercise program, see a registered PT, DC, MD, DO, etc to learn how to use these correctly.
5	1367366400	I got my dad a theracane a few years back and I've never seen him use it.  Occasionally I would try it, and I thought it was ok.  When I started having back pains from carrying my toddler who is always squirming to get free, I decided to get one for myself.  But then I saw the Body Back Buddy, and decided to try it out.  I'm so happy I did.  It's stiffer so you can apply more pressure, it has more knobs, round knobs and pointy knobs which I prefer, and even 2 knobs close together that do a great job massaging your neck.  The Body Back Buddy is perfect for when I'm watching TV on the sofa.  It makes me want to use it just talking about it.  Get it, you'll see.
5	1367280000	The Body Back Buddy works really well. Really helped me to get some sore spots out of my back. I would definitely recommend it.
3	1367280000	I bought really for my husband who was back issues. My issues are more in the hips and legs. So I tried using the Body Back Buddy this week on my issues before giving to my husband. I really didn't feel it was more effective than a tennis ball and foam roller. HOWEVER, my issues are hips and legs and that is where I used it. I did try it on my back and it felt ok but I wasn't &#34;WOWED&#34; by the experience. Again, maybe I don't have the best problem areas for this item. I will ask my husband how it works for him when he gets a chance to use it and update my review accordingly. For now I am happy to stick with my roller and tennis ball.
5	1367280000	Usually, I am the masseur but with this device I can get all the hard to reach areas without having to overwork my already tired hands. My hubby has really tense muscles as well as adhesions in his upper back and chest so this &#34;S&#34; cane worked better than the original candy cane shape. HIghly recommend just upgrading to this model over the other.
4	1367020800	This product is great for releasing knots - the two knobs placed close together for your neck feel great when there is tension in the back of your neck/occipitals.I feel like the people giving this product bad reviews simply do not have the kind of pain that it takes care of. If you have painful muscular knots, you will be reaching for this product when you're seeking relief. I used to use a tennis ball against the wall, but this is much more effective and really provides you with relief.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because of its size - I'd love to be able to carry it in a tote bag on day trips, but it is simply too big for that. Other than that, great product and I would recommend it to anyone who uses a tennis ball for painful knots.
5	1367020800	I bought this for tightness in my shoulders and upper back. I was skeptical but it works! I use it often (and I've had it for well over a year), especially after sitting at a computer for a long time. It is very easy to use and sturdy. Having read some of the other reviews here just now, I need to try using it other places than just my back! Give this a try, it doesn't replace a real massage, but it does help.
4	1366934400	Is good to press those hard to reach tight muscles on my back.  Not sure it's totally worth $35, but it does feel like good quality plastic.
5	1366761600	I've nick-named it, &#34;The Back-inator&#34;!!! I was in physical therapy for a trapezius muscle spasm, right shoulder tendinitis and an AC joint sprain. I kept re-injuring the middle trap area of my trapezius muscle and I had been in PT for weeks and weeks and weeks. Now, I can un-tighten this area by myself without the help of my PT in about 20 minutes, depending on how far the tightness has spread. I love it!!!!!
5	1366675200	I get knots in my shoulders and back all of the time. I happen to come across a smiler item to this and started reading about it.While reading about it it lead me to this one due to it being one piece and not prone to break like the first one I read about.I have had 3 neck surgery's, 3 lower back surgery's and my left shoulder rebuilt. With all this going on I constantly get knots in my shoulders, back and neck areas. While I'm writing this review I have used the Back Buddy.I have been able to save myself from taking medications many times by using the Back Buddy.I hate to take pills so anything I can do, not to take the I will do it.You have a Great Product Here!!!!Thank You for making It!!!!
4	1366588800	Has all sorts of knobs that seem to be able to get to every place I need. Haven't discovered all of its possibilities yet
5	1366329600	It works wonders for my ball up muscles, trigger points! What people do need to realize, and I only know through physical therapy, that it will hurt and possibly bring tears to your eyes. Thats how you know its doing its job. It's part of the process of getting those muscles to relax. But the pain wears off and in the end, it's sooo worth it! So if you aren't aware of how to use it and what feeling (ouch) is normal then No you will not like it.
3	1366329600	Ever go to a massage or a health worker and they never get the spot?  Well, this thing will allow you to reach those hard to reach or describe areas and apply just enough pressure to make a difference.  One use on my back already made a difference.  However, when I tried to use it to apply gentle stretching or circular pull, it was too difficult or hurt.  This I think is the problem with this tool, it is really just a trigger point massage tool, not a general purpose massage facilitator.  The shape of the massage points are just too small.  One end is so pointed and long it actually looks dangerous.  Fortunately that end is inside one of the loops and one won't normally fall on it and get impaled like some vampire.  Of course, I just got this and have to learn to use it better.I like this product, even that smaller version would be nice to take on long trips or to the office, the big one, nah, would get too many raunchy jokes.  So, yes I recommend the product, but nothing will come close to a real massage by a licensed professional who is also skillful and ready to listen.
5	1366243200	I got this thing a week ago. I have tendinitis in both feet and have been learning trigger point therapy. What a miracle, I feel little to no foot pain after many years of living with it. Works great at getting the knots out of your back too. Worth the purchase, you will not regret it.
4	1366156800	My P.T. therapist suggested I purchase it. I like the fact that it comes with an instruction book. I did not realize I could use it for other things besides the reason I purchased it.
5	1365811200	This is one of the best products made for trigger points and reaching areas that plague the back. The product is very versatile and will probably last a lifetime. This is a very good investment for treating back issues.
5	1365811200	I have to say that this is very very useful for athletes and rock climbers. I did quite a bit of climbing (until I recently tore my A2 tendon pulley) and this thing is great for working out those tight knots when you don't want to pay for a professional massage. It's such a simple contraption, but it's very effective. It gives you just the right kind of leverage you need to provide pin-point massaging to any muscle. I'm a 6'1&#34; guy, decently strong, and I have no worries about this breaking. It's very sturdy.
3	1365724800	I don't use this device as much as I thought I would.  And nothing compares to a human hand.  This device is very stiff and kind of tedious to use.  The book it comes with is somewhat helpful.
4	1365638400	Works as designed, and I love that it lets you hit muscles that are difficult for self-massage while the muscles are actually relaxed.  My only gripe is that for me the pointy knobs are just a bit too pointy.  Maybe a personal preference though, and the round knobs work fine.  My wife hates to rub my back, and this gives me a fallback after a workout.
5	1365638400	It was given as gift for Christmas, and the recipient was very happy! , , , , , , ,
5	1365552000	I love this product!! Very helpful and versatile. It is easy to use. Besides the one I bought for myself I have bought 3 others for family members.
5	1365379200	I had this thing for a couple of years, and it does wonders for my sore back.  It's built very tough and it will last a long time!
5	1365292800	My mother-in-law used this back buddy before that someone else had and it did wonders for her. She had to go and outlet chase it for herself.
5	1364947200	You can really get to a lot of hard-to-reach spots, with ease, with this thing.  I love the design--the different size ends and tips.  You can really get good leverage as well to apply more pressure if needed.  This is definitely worth the money if you can't afford to get a massage every week or your girlfriend/wife is too lazy to give you one.
5	1364860800	This is great for my back. It hits the exact right spot and you can control the pressure for your knots. Probably the best item I have ever purchased. I recommend everyone having one of these. Saves so much on massage and actually works.
5	1364774400	i was paralized for three years.  this is my new favorite thing. i recommend everyone have one.  I brought it to work so my coworkers could use it.
5	1364515200	I love this thing. I've been really stressed and having issues with tension headaches and a tight neck, but since I've received this product things have been getting better! I come home from work, spend 10 minutes on the couch with this guy, and I can feel a difference in my body. I still haven't figured out exactly what all the little knobs and bits do, but it's been great for getting all the spots on my upper back and my shoulders. I highly recommend this tool if you've been dealing with knots or tension headaches.
5	1364515200	I love this tool. You will to.It's very difficult to find someone who can apply enough pressureto your trigger points to give any relief..and impossible to apply enough toyourself. This tool works wonderfully. It not only works very well on the shoulder area(s)but can be used on the feet as well as the lower back, etc.I highly recommend it. And at this price,, it's much cheaper than a masseuse.
5	1364428800	I am one of those lucky people who get horrible knots in their back.... The type of knots that massage therapist hate.  The idea behind the back buddy is to apply constant pressure to trigger points in order to release the knot.  And the back buddy does it amazingly so.There is a slight learning curve when using the back buddy, as you need to figure out where to position the back buddy for optimal pressure.  Once you figure out which knobs and which pressure is best for you, the back buddy does amazing work.  I can generally get a large knot out in a day or two, when it used to take weeks.  Even my massage therapist has noticed a huge difference.I would recommend this product to anyone who has issues with muscle pain due to muscle knots.  You will not be disappointed.
5	1364342400	The back buddy is the perfect tool to put pressure on those pressure points that get tight.  I sit at a computer most of the day, so my right shoulder is consistently tense.  If I use the back buddy for  few minutes when I get home, I feel 100% better!  It also comes with a brochure to help you identify pressure points.
4	1364342400	Great product - only problem I found is that no manual is provided on all exercises that can be done.
5	1364256000	The Body Back Buddy was suggested by my physical therapist & it works wonderfully on my sore back muscles. Several of my family & friends have tried it and want one too.
5	1364169600	I had shoulder surgery a few years ago and though it is much better now I still get pain around the shoulder blade, neck and tricep.  This tool is great for massaging sore shoulder muscles around the upper back.  Love this and would buy it again if this were stolen.
3	1364169600	For the quick del. started using it right away ,,  ,,  ,,  ,,  ,,  ,,  ,,  ,,  ,,  ,,  ,,
5	1364169600	This thing is awesome. I can get to the knots in my shoulder and back. I can also get to my lower back and neck (which hurts a little, but that has to do with me, not the product). It's sturdy and the knobs are strategically placed. I had read some reviews that said it was made of plastic... well yes very hard plastic material. I have no concern of it breaking. I haven't yet figured out how to best get the foot with this thing. It takes a minor learning curve. You can adjust the way you hold it and what you do with it according to your own needs. I'd imagine it would vary with your body height and weight also. I am average (female) on both. It does hurt a little if you are working out a knot... but that is because you are working out a knot, not because this product itself is too hard. It is supposed to be sturdy like that.
2	1363996800	I have lots of muscle spasms and someone recommended this for me.  It sounded great since hard pressure helps a great deal with my muscle spasms and lets them release.  However, I found this hard to use and it didn't realize any spasms when I applied the pressure.  I was very disappointed as it seemed like a great idea.  I found Brookstone has a massager that works on pressure points that works pretty well and I use that instead.
5	1363910400	I had friends use other versions of these--mostly flexible metal loops w two balls on the end. they can't hold a candle to this thing. its very solid, not flexy at all, and the little nibs allow you to dig into tender spots w amazing force.the pic of the woman using it to get a pressure point on her back is a great illustration. I can work from the front of my body and use the curves on this thing to really dig into sore spots in a way I couldn't otherwise.I don't know about the guy saying he's too big to use it, I've seen many guys use these quite well. so I don't know if its just technique or maybe he's atlas.it just really nice to be able to sit or stand use this. I don't have to  move around or try and pin myself against a wall to put a lot of force into it--the design of this just does it all for me.for whole body muscle massage id say the noodle (the big foam roller that you can roll your whole back across) is really good--assuming you're able to actually get down without issue and roll your whole back across it, but  for pressure point release this is the one.
4	1363910400	This is a good product.  I grew up using an &#34;S&#34; cane that was metal with two wooden knobs....and this is my upgrade.  I love the choices for different areas.  Very nice.
5	1363392000	I don't know where to start, this helps my whole body. I wake up less sore and I've been using it less and less.The only issue I've had is storing it.
5	1363392000	I like a pretty deep massage and this is a great way to compensate since I can only afford one massage a month.
5	1363305600	This product allows you to reach areas of your body with much greater ease.  It is so well designed.  One caution:  I knew that I should be careful when using this tool on tender trigger points on my shoulders and neck, but I guess I overdid it since it felt so good to make contact with all these points of pain, to finally confront the sources of my discomfort.But I must certainly have overdone it, even though I applied pressure for no more than 10 seconds to each node and without much force, since I was in a great deal of pain the next day with neck pain so severe that I couldn't function at all, and had to take a lot of Ibuprofen for two days, until the pain suddenly went away.  And I do feel better than before using the tool.  So easy does it.
4	1363305600	My hair stylist noticed I was in pain during an appointment.  She told me about the Body Back Buddy and I ordered it.  It works the exact area I need for my muscle spasm and I am confident it will continue to ease my pain in that area.
4	1363046400	Saw this first time at a Vegan Festival. Tried for few seconds, amazed by the results. I mostly use it for my upper back, but the pressure points are really useful for the lower back, legs, even bottom of the feet for a reflexology.
5	1362700800	This works out the kinks in my back after I figured out not to be so rough trying to do so. Came fast. still strong & works, I love it, Recommended!
5	1362528000	it took me a while to get the light-bulb on this one and realize that its an ingenious therapeutic tool as opposed to another nifty gizmo, but it is. If you have pain for which a massage might be effective, the great thing here is that its self controlled so you can work on the bad spots more regularly. Its not everything, but a skillfully wielded one of these will prove a very effective tool for those suffering certain types of pain
4	1362528000	i like it... a bit tricky due to size, but once you find the trigger points....ahhh tough love, good pain...
3	1362528000	It's a little hard to use.  Seems to need a lot of pressure, which is hard on hands and shoulders to &#34;push&#34; against it.
5	1362441600	On top of the thousands of other reviews for the BBB, I have to agree.  This tool is awesome and it has totally taken away the need to beg the hubby for a massage.  He no longer has to beg me either.  This is just a wonderful tool for reaching all of those spots that you couldn't get to before.  It takes a minute to get it but once you do you can get in to all the spots that cause you pain.  I highly recommend this!
5	1362355200	Although this product is not a cure-all, it actually does the job in relieving some pain/discomfort, especially in those hard-to-reach sore places or knots. I only use mine a few times a week since I'm currently seeing a chiropractor twice/week. Any time I have a knot or tension, I use it and I feel relief almost immediately. It's kind of like getting a deep tissue massage....but you're the one massaging yourself and you determine how much pressure to apply and where to apply it. Strange-looking product but it works!
5	1361923200	I just got this yesterday and used it last night. Fumbled just a bit getting the hang of where to put the hands and whether to push or pull the device. It took just a couple minutes to get the feel of the leverage. The tool is very effective at pushing in to trigger points.  For me, it took very little pressure to produce profound results-- electric zaps and pain in places I had no idea were affected by my trigger points. I woke up this morning in a bit less pain than usual.  Loosening up the vise grip in my back and shoulders will be a lengthy process, I'm sure. But, not being able to afford time or money for regular massage therapy, this is my solution. I feel a sense of relief and happiness that I can manage on my own.
3	1361923200	I love the IDEA of this thing, but in practice it needs some improvement.  For one thing, an instructional booklet would be nice, to help with placement of the various knob ends.  And perhaps also a warning that you might not want to press very hard when you're just starting to use it: I ended up with bruises and a sore back after my first use.  I'm not giving up, though; it definitely helps put pressure on some of those trigger points that I can't reach on my own - and focuses the pressure on the places I can reach.
5	1361577600	The Body Back Buddy is by far one of my most favorite purchases thus far on Amazon.  Great tool for self massage.  You can really create leverage to work trigger points.  Sturdy Quality.  Very happy with this purchase!
5	1361491200	I cannot love this product more. My whole family uses it. We can help ourselves with back pain rather than begging someone for a massage.
5	1361404800	this is an ingenious product. It is very effective and a targeted way to give oneself some trigger point work.
4	1361404800	I'm still trying to learn how to get all the benefits from this but so far it has relieved several trigger points in my shoulders and helped me sleep!
5	1361318400	This is probably the very best self-massage tool I've ever used!!!And, i have to say, i've probably tried them all.....
5	1361059200	I'm not a flexible person and this makes self massage possible for me. I can hit any trigger point on my back or kneed out any knot. Stop reading the reviews and just buy it and try it yourself. You WONT  be unhappy!
5	1361059200	I live with chronic back pain and this thing rocks!!!  I used to borrow one from a friend at work but decided I had to have one myself.  I have never regretted it for a minute!  It's simply the best designed version of this type of device and really works!
5	1360886400	The Body Back Buddy helped the first time I used it after the first 5 minutes, I could feel the effects.  It reached my shoulders completely where I hadn't been able to reach.  It felt so much better from the pain I was use to.  Very glad I purchased it.
4	1360713600	helps relieve painful stressful tension in the back, hips, down the legs etc.quite handy to have around when you need to get to a sore spot and to press on acupuncture points. the only reason i gave it a four instead of a five was if it had one area that i could use as a scratcher, then it would be a five....
5	1360540800	My wife uses this all the time. She has fibromyalgia and her back is like a rock. This weird looking massager hits all the pressure points. It's kind of bulky to store, but when your back is killing you it's a God send.
5	1360368000	Used this for the first time tonight & it is amazing, for less than half the price of 1 deep tissue trigger point massage.
4	1360195200	My husband loved it so much once he got the hang of it, that he now claims it as his own!
5	1360195200	I've had chronic back pain dating back to a completely detached rhomboid that I suffered a few years ago. After surgery, I've been dealing with extremely tight muscles, painful trigger points and misaligned joints in my spine.Just received this today and I'm so grateful for taking the risk in ordering one of these! I haven't been able to put it away since really getting into my soft tissue. Although I'm still finding different ways to maneuver the BBB to target certain spots, at many angles... this beats rolling around on lacrosse balls, hands down!I haven't used the Thera Cane, but I'm finding that the extra hook comes in handy by pinning the BBB under my leg for added pressure in hitting areas around my scapula and first rib!
4	1360022400	I like the idea of this product and it does a really nice job of working the knots out. My only problem is the price... I think $20 would be a much more reasonable price for what it is, but I suppose it's still a fraction of the price of a massage so I'll cease complaining right there. :)
5	1359849600	No longer do I have to wait to get a massage to work the tightness out of my back muscles. It's not a &#34;feel good&#34; piece of equipment. But, it gets to the spots that need to be worked out. I feel that it's worthwhile.
5	1359849600	This product is great.  When you need a back rub and there is no one to do it, this is the answer.  My husband received one for Christmas and we loved it so much, I bought one for my daughter and will be getting one for my son also.
5	1359849600	I'm able to release a lot of tension in my back with the Back Buddy.  My back flexibility has increased tremendously.  I do use other items, and do yoga regularly too.  The use of this and then a trigger point foam roller has really been amazing for me.  It was also really helpful after discomfort that followed being rear ended.
5	1359849600	I purchased this after a suggestion from my massage therapist.  I like deep pressure massage and get knots in my back that are impossible for me to reach or apply enough pressure to on my own.  I ususally only use one or two of the points for my knots but the accompanying brochure shows the many ways you can use this product.  Rounded and pointed tips are positioned at appropriate intervals to reach low back muscles (on each side of the spine), neck muscles, and a variety of other places.  It works better using it over a thin shirt.  There is too much friction on bare skin unless you use lotion.  Just be careful, my therapist said she had to put it down because she was hurting herself!  As I said, I like deep pressure so it's perfect for me!
5	1359763200	I had been looking at this for a while and finally purchased it via Groupon Goods and I am so glad I did. I have only used it about 4 times since purchasing it 8 months ago but it has worked amazing each time. I currently have a strained muscle that is causing a pinched never in my back and I would not be functioning without this! I highly recommend it!
4	1359676800	I use this often to reach pressure points in my back. I had surgery on my arm that left me with problems in my shoulder and this allows me to reach the points in my back and shoulder.
5	1359590400	For many years I've had low back herniated disc issues. Injections only work for so long and if at all. I can feel all my muscles tighten from my glutes through the hips, lower back, and up my erector spinae. My recent chiropractor feels most of my issues are related to these muscles tightening and focuses his work on me with myofascial release rather than adjustments. I've tried other products and a few do- it- myself things with moderate results. I'd seen this product, but never pulled the trigger. I'm so happy I decided to purchase it!  It allows one, on their own, to target the problem areas.  The precision, leverage, and accessibility to the areas it provides is amazing. I'm considering purchasing another for the office and one as a gift. Highly recommended!Update:  I've owned and loved the product for nearly two months. I constantly find new ways for it to provide relief by trial and error. Also, online video sites are a good resource for demonstrations. I decided rather than to haul my product everywhere, I bought the 3 pack. It's like getting one for free. Now I have one at the office, home, my girlfriends home, and an extra that I will probably lend out or give as a gift. I'd like to say I'd hang onto the extra if one would break, but I don't see that happening. The material is very durable. Still highly recommended!
5	1359244800	Gets to all those hard to reach places. A lot more thought was put into this than you might think. The little booklet it comes with is also very helpful.
5	1359244800	I hesitated to buy one of these for a long time, even though I have a number of muscle knots and trigger points that bother me.  I kept telling myself, why not just use a pen, or similar object -- how could this device really be all that different and better than something I had sitting around the house?I finally broke down and bought it.  The thing I want to point out about this miraculous device is that the handling of it is the magic.  Not just the shape, but also the placement of the knobs, makes it extremely easy to manipulate this tool in ways that aren't putting additional strain on you while you try to work out muscle knots.  The balance point and weight also add to the genius of this design.It is extremely adaptable.  There are two knob shapes, round and more pointed, and each really does give a different effect.I would say this device is safe to use unless you are a person who lacks body awareness.  Some people do, it's nothing to be ashamed of; it likely just means you were never involved in any sports or the like.  But if that is the case, and you should be honest with yourself, then you shouldn't use devices like this, because you could possibly hurt yourself.  Of course, you want to be sure to never apply this to a joint or bone, the spine, etc.  I was always advised by masseuses and health practitioners that it's usually best to start with the feet (tense feet disrupt your ability to relax other body areas), and always manipulate such devices toward the heart (i.e., if you are doing your arms, start at the lower parts and work your way up toward the shoulder, rather than the other way).
4	1358985600	When my Chirpractor told me to get the Body Back Buddy because it would save me money in Dr. bills I highly doubted him.  My problem is tight muscles from overuse keeping them same positon for too long. Wirh thw Body Back Buddy you can get directly to the muscle a and with a little pressure can release that muscle.  One of the best purchases I have made in a long time. Highly recommended.
5	1358726400	I'm a little bit of a masochist when it comes to massages, and this lets me use all the pressure I need. I get knotted up from working out and sitting at my desk all day, which is a pretty lethal combination. I've used lacrosse balls, which aren't a terrible option, but this is so much better! I can really dig into the spots that bother me, and it's certainly easier than trying to get a buddy to find the exact right spot (and then to use enough pressure). I use it when I'm working, watching tv or using my stair stepper (multi-tasking!).I can't recommend this highly enough. It looks a little crazy, but after a little trial and error, you'll figure out what works best for you. And best of all: no more begging for back rubs!
4	1358726400	My boyfriend is a massage therapist. That being said, I like this thing almost as much as I like his massages.
4	1358640000	Happy with the product, recommend to anyone who has stress points, can pin point by self, thanksshipped quickly, recommend to others.
5	1358640000	I use it as close to daily as my stupid crazy schedule allows and it does wonders for helping me to release tension in my knotted up back.
5	1358640000	This is what I needed for the last 5 years! I can work exactly on my trigger points and has substantially decreased the amount of medications for headache and neck pain. It is actually better than the massage therapist (no offense) because I can pin-point  the places I need the most. However, I have to confess that this work extremely well for me because I am a health care provider with training in myofascial pain and trigger points.
5	1358640000	Had one but gave it to a friend so needed another. Excellent product. Save money on massages! Would buy again.
5	1358640000	My massage therapist told me about this Trigger Point Massager. I don't know how I managed before I had this. As a writer, I spend hours at the computer, and I've been doing that for years. The end result has been a successful book career, and neck-shoulders-back muscle spasms. I see a chiropractor when I need an adjustment, and I visit my massage therapist two or three times a month.The Back Buddy keeps me going on a daily basis. I've actually felt a muscle spasm "melt" as I call it -- or relax when using this.Highly recommended. You'll love it.
3	1358640000	The Body Back Buddy I purchased on line looks like what is pictured.  After seeing one similar to it in an LMP's office, I was expecting a size and weight of object, which would be easy to handle.  This particular model is much 'beefier' than I need and expected.
5	1358553600	Seems to really help my wire - she bought it.  It reaches places you cannot with out it.  Love it
5	1358553600	Okay short and simple.  If you need something like this, buy this one.  Very strong with more good ideas than you knew.
5	1358467200	I often have back spasms & keep this by my chair in the livingroom to use.  May not use every day, but when I need it, it is a godsend!  Instead of having to try to press out the spasm with a wall corner or begging my husband (who can never get it right), I use this & it really works.  Bought a trigger point book also that helps me find the right place to press.  If you have upper back spasms, shoulder spasms & don't mind taking charge of your problem, this item really is for you!
5	1358467200	I am a professional athlete and I use this back buddy all the time. I can't just get a massage every day of the week, so I purchased this recently remembering when I saw one of my buddies using it a few years ago. It is great and a sturdy product. I have been very pleased and would recommend to anyone with upper back knots frequently. Also very durable as well. I am 275lbs and I really come down hard on this back buddy and it withstands the test.
5	1358467200	I'm traveling out of town on business for long periods of time and miss my weekly deep tissue massage therapist.  This is a great way to get through between massages.  I can press on trigger points and release tension easily.  I use it almost daily for a few minutes and find fast relief.  Love the product!
5	1358380800	This was rated great by our PT... he gave us recommendations on how to use it for even more relief from back pain.
5	1358380800	Recieve the Body Back Buddy last week. Have suffered with pain in shoulders for years. Always had to find somebody to work my pressure points. Not any more.  My new best friend the Back Buddy  can do all and more that was advertised.  Some of the best money I ever spent.
5	1358208000	I sit in a vehicle at work for most of a ten hour shift.  Staring at a computer and typing away in a swiveled, contoured position makes my neck ache.  It is constructed very solidly and I use it as recommended for 10-30 seconds  (3-4 sets in each spot) when I feel the tense aching coming on and it relieves it.  It gives you nice access to really anywhere on your body and it extremely useful for me.  I also lift weights and work out five days a week and never realized after using this, just how tender and tight my rhomboids and other surrounding back(shoulder) muscles get.  Very happy with the purchase.
5	1358121600	This device is great. Handles are in the right place, the hooks provide plenty of reach for a person w/a large chest & shoulders. This device is effective by using a properly designed fulcrum system that produces enough leverage & therefore pressure on the 1&#34; ball tip to REALLY help me!Altho I originally purchased it hoping it would help me hit the trigger points in my glutes to help with hip pain, altho it reaches, I just can't get the torque (apply enough pressure) to be noticeable, least of all effective.Another problem area I have is in the low neck/high shoulder area. Sometimes pain & 'pressure' seem to build to the point where I can hardly move & yelling out in pain, I ask my gf for a brutal acupressure application [loosely applied term, all i mean is that she grinds the localized area with great amounts of pinpoint elbow pressure] which solves the problem.HOWEVER, with this device I can apply all the pressure needed to alleviate the pain MYSELF!WARNING!!!  ALTHOUGH EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE  [your results may vary (!)]  you must know that you may have to really hurt yourself to help yourself. If you can tolerate the pain from the pressure you create [& if you don't yell out or growl, it's probably not enough pressure to do the job (altho i hope it is). In that case, reapply with even more pressure. Get that blood flowing to that area & you'll also produce endorphins which is your body's method of creating it's own 'painkillers'QUESTION: IF YOU HAD TO SPEND 60 SECONDS IN EXCRUCIATING, YELLING OUT LOUD PAIN in trade for HOURS or TOTAL relief of your pain... would you?NO, I AM NOT A MASOCHIST!  However after many PT sessions over many years, I can tell you that if a therapist inflicts it or you do,MOST times the pain created by intense, isolated pressure to key muscle areas & trigger points will hurt like hell but be well worth it!QUESTION: IF YOU HAD TO SPEND 60 SECONDS IN EXCRUCIATING, YELLING OUT LOUD PAIN in trade for HOURS or TOTAL relief of your pain... would you?  HELL YES!!!!BOTTOM LINE:  YES, this tool really works. YES, I would buy it again & again and YES, I would strongly recommend it to my family & friends!  But NO!  It's not for those that cannot tolerate intense, short term pain.Michael
5	1357862400	I have tried so many things - including but not limited to .. a vibrating hand held back massager, I bought a chair pad with a massager on it, used creams and back patches trying to release the knots in my back and while these things gave temporary relief.... This Back Buddy has been the only thing that has worked in getting right into the knots and work them out.  I don't think that I will need to dole out any more money to pay for a back massage!
5	1357689600	The back buddy is ah-mazing.I was considering purchasing a thera-cane having just learned some trigger point therapy techniques from a friend.My friend has something like this also but not as many knobs and functions as the body back buddy.This is a sensational tool for myofascial release spots in your back and neck, one that cannot be overlooked.For me, it's a absolute must have.
4	1357603200	Bought this to help relieve pain from a pinched nerve, and it definitely helps.  A little awkward looking so it's not great to take in to work, but it serves its purpose.
1	1357603200	I have a lot of muscle knots in my back, and this has done very little to alleviate  them. I was originally going to rate this 3/5 because I seem to be a one off, but frankly its not doing what it claims to do.
5	1357603200	Purchased this prodcut for my father as a gift as he loves it.  He wanted one ever since he saw and tried the one we had.  We got ours from my aunty who is a massage therapist.  She recommends this product to her clients all the time.  Its perfect to help massage those back and neck knots when no one is there to help.  Very good buy and we highly recommend it.
5	1357516800	I have a lot of back pain and this is truly took care of it. it's so easy to use and you get to decide how much pressure you can handle if you need more you can press more if you don't need is much you can be gentle this is perfect. I also love the little knobs that allow you to put pressure in certain places. I've found a lot of relief with working on my feet.
5	1357516800	I can't say enough good things about this product.  After several years of physical therapy, pain reliever and muscle relaxers I'm finally pain free.  I purchased this along with &#34;The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guid for Pain ...&#34; by Clair Davies.  I am now pain free after many chiropractic, therapy, massage and medical doctor visits.  Read the information carefully, purchase a book to use with the Back Buddy and have patience.  If you place on a spot that is tender and very painful know you have hit the jackpot.  With a couple days of gentle pressure you will be pain free.  I can't say enough about this product.
5	1357430400	So, I had this thing for about a week before I went off to winter break from college, and I knew I HAD to write a review because I was  itching to come back to school just to use it! I missed it and I couldn't wait to get out the knots I'd accumulated over a 3 week period.For one, I am an avid computer user - I'm on for hours upon hours a day. What's worse, I'm also an artist, both traditional and digital, so I'm hunched over for long periods of time. Being so focused on my work, I tend to forget to take breaks and stretch my back, resulting in some terrific neck and shoulder pain, and especially in that awkward place in the middle of your back. I was constantly asking for massages, but I found that people were never quite strong enough to really get into the tight muscles, particularly the trickier knots underneath my shoulder blades.In all honesty, I bought this massager on a complete whim, at 4 am, during hectic finals week. I woke up completely shocked by the fact that I had spent $35 on some phallic looking object. I have to say, though, it has been a fantastic purchase so far. I get the perfect amount of leverage to really drive in the pointed end into the sweet spots in my back. It's also been great for massaging the tops of my shoulders, on either side of my neck, which are rock hard. I can already feel a looseness in my back, and I sleep much better now. I've also been trying to loosen up my lower back - sometimes, when I lay down to sleep, I get these aches in my lower back for some reason, and I figure they were from knots that have simply built up over the years from poor sitting posture. I've researched different trigger points, and the information I've found simply from googling have been a dream - I use this thing for my forearms, my thighs, my calves, and even my butt! There are knots there, and when you relieve those knots, they loosen up your lower back. It's kind of crazy, but you gotta try it to see!I've only been to a masseuse once, but this has been a perfectly adequate substitute. Try it out -- it'll change your life!
5	1357257600	I have very tight shoulders, and this thing is magic.  I've been using it for about a week now (1-2 times per day) and have already seen a huge difference.  The main advantage of this item over a theracane is the pointed tip on one of the curved ends that REALLY allows you to pinpoint and &#34;dig&#34; much more effectively.
4	1357171200	You really need to learn how to use this properly or at least how you prefer before you can judge it.  Often, having someone working on your back is tough cause they cannot feel exactly where the knot is.  With this, you can work whatever part of your back you like for as long as you like.  Well worth it.
5	1357171200	I saw this as a recommended product and my roommate told me he's used one before and it was amazing.  He was right... hits all the spots, well thought out, and I'm sure that the people who invented this are now filthy rich, and they deserve to be - there's nothing like this on the market at all... just get it.
5	1357084800	I have severe muscle stiffness and pain in my neck shoulders, and have done a lot of stretching and exercise in attempts to ease the pain, but nothing has been as wonderful as this.  It takes some practice to figure out, but the possibilities are endless.  The neck, Shoulder, rib, and lower back are all within reach, and the device is capable of holding a lot of force.  I found I've been able to adjust my lower neck, mid back, and shoulders with only about 5 minutes of effort.  I've pushed and twisted as hard as I can, and there's not even a hint of yielding or cracking.  The beauty is that it's got so many different positions, and the pressure points are arranged in so many different spots, that it will work wherever you need it.Sure, the think looks funny, seems excessively large and your friends will probably comment about it being some kind of wierd sex toy... but just go with it, it's awesome.
5	1357084800	Bought this as a Christmas present for my husband and sister.  They both LOVE this!  It really gets into those hard to get pressure points.  Has already relieved some of the muscle soreness in my husband's back.
5	1357084800	I have been dealing with a bad shoulder for years & this allows me to perform trigger point release of the muscles that are hard to reach. I can't believe I waited soo long to break down a purchase this device. Its now something I use on a daily basis for my muscle aches, pains & tightness. Its a great way to get relief when you cant afford accupuncture or a massage!! Inexpensive life saver!!
5	1356998400	I am really happy with the purchase. It's a great way on applying pin point pressure with the strength and accuracy that only you and your body feel is right. I think it's a nice tool to have along with stretching.
5	1356912000	have used this for a while, but had a really bad cricked neck recently and it worked better than anything!!! Thank you!!
5	1356739200	This item compares to the Thericane brand of trigger point tools.  But, it has more nodes and different shapes.  We actually like it more than the thericane.
4	1356739200	but it's not as easy to use as it would seem.  it needs like a video or something.  but it does feel nice when i can figure it out.
5	1356652800	This body back buddy is wonderful for those times between visits to my massage therapist. It helps me keep the knots away in my back. And it feels good
5	1356652800	This is the best product for pretty much instant relief of muscle tension and back or neck pain. Actually, anywhere on the body where there's muscle tension and/or pain.I'm a man who has had back and neck pain for years, lower back surgery in 1992, and subsequent back & muscle problems since then. I've used just about every product made, from the thumping massagers to the little knobbies and other similar products, and visited chiropractors since 1974.I purchased one of these almost a year ago, and absolutely love it. I even pack it in my suitcase when I go places, and ended up leaving it behind on recent trip. So, I just had to buy another. I've found nothing else that is as effective. Nothing.I apply firm and direct pressure to the area of my body where the muscles are tight, continuously, until the tight muscles start to release and relax, then move on to another area. The relief is pretty much instant, where virtually nothing else would work properly, and I prefer not to medicate. I'd rather deal with the problem and have the pain gone than simply mask it.I had ankle pain that's been plaguing me for years, put one of the knobs under the heel of my foot where I discovered pain that I hadn't realized before, and in about 45 seconds the ankle pain was gone. The almost daily ankle pain appeared to be cured for about 2-1/2 months after that. I re-apply the pressure as needed.Do yourself a favor and get this if you have chronic back or muscle tension and/or pain. I'm sure you'll find it's the best thing you'll ever use for it, and find it indispensable, like I have.
5	1356480000	Body Back Buddy is awesome! I bought it for my father and father in law and myself! It takes out all my knots. I carry my stress in my shoulders and this thing makes me feel like im getitng a deep tissue massage. I am buying one for my brother in law :)
5	1356480000	The back buddy saved the day when my neck started acting up. My appointment calendar was fully booked, and then my neck and shoulder decided to act up. Using the back buddy between clients did the trick.
5	1356220800	This is absolutely the best tool I've found for breaking up those tough knots.  You can get alot of leverage without much pressure at all.  This tool is a must have for tight, sore backs!
2	1356220800	The ball ends just too pinpoint for me. Maybe I was not using it properly, but it did not relieve pain made it worse.
5	1356220800	I've had a recurring knot in my upper back for the past several weeks, and I haven't had any consistent success in getting relief. I can't say the Body Back Buddy has cured my ailment, but it has let me get much-needed relief. It's a crazy-looking thing, but it's very sturdy and versatile. The various knobs do an excellent job of letting you get as much or as little focus on specific spots as you want, though those same knobs lend some of the handles an unfortunately phallic look. That aside, the BBB is a great tool. I recommend it very highly.
5	1356134400	My colleague at work had one looking very similar to this. I would NEVER have thought how great it feels on those tight knots I get and have on my back. This one is easy to use and you can place more or less pressure as needed. You can use this on your back or legs, arms, neck, the s-shaped one is better than the hook one because it is more versatile. Very sturdy, durable, I have had mine for about 3 years now.
5	1355961600	Online shopping is always a hit or miss. Yes, for some products there may be dozens or hundreds of positive reviews, but who knows how many of those people are being compensated for writing them, etc. I want to write this as a real, ordinary person who ordered this after a half hour of comparing reviews for this and similar products.I casually decided to open it before I wrapped it up for Christmas, just so I could see what it looked like in person and also to give it a quick try. Here I am twenty minutes later completely blissed out and surprised by how well this works!I didn't need the instructions manual, as using this feels fairly intuitive to me. The knobs are, as the other reviews say, pretty hard but that makes it all the easier for you--you don't need to push as hard to get it to work. I highly recommend this product, I have never felt inclined to write a review before.That being said, we should all support our local businesses in addition to online shopping! Just saying!
4	1355875200	I ordered this a couple months ago and came to write a review and realized I never received the miniature back buddy, only the larger one. It looks like I'm not the only person this has happened to! Be wary & verify your fulfillment! I am very disappointed...
3	1355788800	I usually read about all of the reviews before I buy something so, I did the same thing before buying this item. The strange thing was, when I got this item, I found it to be nothing close to the 5 star reviews. during the past 12 years, I have been having a serious back pain usually once a year which kind of disable me for a week or two and sometimes it go away by itself and sometimes I have to have a muscle relaxing injection. so, when I saw the reviews, I bought this item and after using it for a long time and in many different ways, I found it to be more like a big joke. all it does, it press any place in your body. obviously , just  pressing a place in your back alone doesn't fix and back problem and I say it since I have been having the back problem because of the muscle movement and have tried this tool in any possible way with no effect. at the same time, two years ago, I bought one of these little machines which after you sit on it, it hang you upside down. from the time I bought this machine, any time I got a back problem, I use this machine and hang upside down and do move a little to left and right and that's it, I have never had the same back pain any more. That is real, not based on a review but based on using something and then judging it so, I think this tool is useless and I won't recommend it to any one with any kind of back pain since it won't do you any good and it will be waste of your money.
5	1355788800	Body Back Buddy is a good product. You can use it many places on your body. You can use it on someone else. It works well.
5	1355702400	This thing looks crazy when you take it out of the package but it works wonders. I briefly glanced at the instructions and then got to work on my problem areas. I was able to work though a constant nagging knot in my shoulder/back area.  I've had it 3 weeks or so and am primarily still working my upper back and shoulders. I know not to bother the knots too much but a few minutes every other day should be good for starters.Great product. It has helped me tremendously. If I could bring one to work and not look like an idiot I would. But I would, so I won't.
4	1355616000	I have used this item in trigger point therapy and it allows me to hit trigger areas with pinpoint accuracy.  The design allows for enough controlled pressure to be applied to reach deep trigger areas in the back.
5	1355616000	This works very well to press against those pesky sore muscles.  Be careful as it is easy to go to hard
4	1355529600	I originally thought since it was plactic wasn't going to be as effective but works just as the metal ones.
5	1355443200	I have chronic knots in my upper trap, levator scap and rhomboids.  The best thing is to get a good massage but who can afford that? and  I feel bad asking my husband every night.  BBuddy really does allow you to apply a good amount of pressure to unreachable places.  I also bought one for my sister.
5	1355356800	bought this as a cheaper alternative to the theracane--but from what I can tell, it's even better. great for the tension/knots in my upper-back--and from what I can tell, should help with a lot of other areas if you follow the pamphlet and contort yourself:)
5	1355356800	I love my Back Buddy.  I bought this because I have chronic pain in my right trapezius muscle near the shoulder blade from years and years of competitive swimming.  This is almost an impossible area for me to reach on my own and the pressure needed on the area made it very hard work for my husband.  The Back Buddy is awesome because I can get to the affected area whenever I want and apply the pressure needed to get relief of my referred pain (the tennis ball and corner methods pale in comparison).  My quality of life has improved since purchasing it.  I would recommend it to anyone suffering from hard to reach muscular back pain.Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.
5	1354406400	There are very few natural, externally-used products to deal with back pain, as well as other aching muscles, I've experienced over the past 40 years that warrant 5 stars. This is one of a handful of products that definitely earn it. In fact, when one was lost during travel, I had to immediately replace it.Quite literally, this product resolves serious muscle-induced pains, from my head to my feet. The two different shapes of knobs work into muscles at varying depths with either general or more pin-pointed accuracy.I like to position it where I want, applying firm and gradually increasing pressure with my hands, arms or feet, until the muscle releases the tension it's holding. I might then target another nearby muscle or another area of the same muscle next. The outcome is almost immediate relief from what might otherwise be almost debilitating.I've had situations where I've done something to aggravate a muscle in my back, shoulder and/or neck, where it results in serious pain from pulling my spine out of alignment and/or disk compression, even what sometimes feels as intense as migraine headaches. I use this for about 2-3 minutes in a few key areas, for no more that 30-45 seconds per location, and about 80% relief is achieved almost instantly, making it bearable. If I decide to then massage the now loosened muscles a little further, even more relief is achieved.I've even had long-term pain in one of my ankles that was treated with this. I used the more conical pressure knob on an area in front of my heel, where I discovered there was a high level of sensitivity, and applied the same firm and increasing pressure for about 30 seconds. What resulted was a relief from almost daily ankle pain I'd had for over 3 years, without pain medications, that lasted over three months!The bottom line is this: You NEED to try this product if you suffer from muscle pain and/or spasms, are tired of doing nothing to cure the problem and having to take pain medications, and want to actually do something about resolving the source of your pain. However, understand that improper use could result in injuries to people with more serious issues, and be aware that sometimes releasing the muscle tightness results a high concentration of whatever is stored in the muscle (lactic acid, etc.) into the bloodstream. Drink plenty of water afterwards.So, be more aware of your body and the messages it's telling you, instead of covering it up with often needless and excessive medications. I choose to say "YES" to my Body Back Buddy, and "NO" to Vicodin and Valium.
4	1354233600	Cant say much for this product as I have not had the opportunity to use it but it is as described, very durable in construction and could hold up to any type of massage work in my opinion
5	1354147200	When I first saw how big it was I was worried about being able to use and maneuver it but it is really very easy.  Works great on those hard to reach knots.
5	1354147200	My massage therapist recommended one of these for me to use in between visits.  What an awesome product! I LOVE it & would recommend it to others.
5	1353888000	This is great!  It works great on my knots in my back and shoulders.  I even use it on my feet!  It can really work the areas with some good pressure.
5	1353888000	Wish I would have found this sooner. I've been to multiple specialist related to pain to no avail. Seems it has been trigger points from musculoskeletal issues. The back buddy in combination with the trigger point therapy workbook by Claire Davies has  put me back in control.
5	1353715200	We descovered this product from friends of ours.  They were telling us about it and showing how to use it.  My wife and I thought we might benefit from it so we ordered it and whalaa!! It does do what it says and we use quite a lot.  It has really helped tightness in in our back and neck, etc.  So glad we found this!!
5	1353369600	This thing sure looks strange, but whoever figured it out did a fabulous job. It is easy to hold on to and apply pressure wherever you need it.If one end doesn't work, just turn it around and the other end will.You don't have to apply all the pressure with your hands either, you can use your arms to push on it.It is hard to describe, but after you have use it and tried it at different angles and directions, you will find that it is very effective at applying pressure on any tense or knotted up muscles just about anywhere in your body.
5	1353369600	I have some neuro issues and this tool allows me to handle the issues as soon as they arise instead of simply taking medicine and hoping that the medicine alone is going to help me.I had a slightly more simplistic device, and this one is worlds apart from the old one.  I can't say enough positive things about the design and the fact that if I wake up at night, have a spasm attack in the day or some other scenario - it's this tool that I turn to first.Simply put - It's EPIC
5	1353283200	My girlfriend bought this as a present for me (I think she was tired of giving me massages) and I was a little skeptical but this thing works wonders! I am a triathlete so I work out a lot and while I have a foam roller andOriginal Massage StickI use for my legs I was lacking a way to get the knots out of my shoulders and back.Other reviewers have covered all the little features of this product so I will just cover my favorite use, using the curved end to get knots in my upper back (shoulder blades) and back of my shoulders. These are full of tension and the body back buddy lets me work them out. I'm sure I will come up with some other uses as well.The only negative is my friends think it looks like some sort of kinky sex toy...
4	1353283200	I am using the Body Back Buddy daily and each day, I get better at finding tight spots in my body. It is easy to use and I would recommend it to others.
5	1353110400	This was amazing . Real limo sticks are made of wood from a guava tree .this plastic one does the job just as well if not better.
5	1353024000	I have several back issues, when I received this (which I believe I received one day after ordering, super quick) I started using it right a way! Although when you're using it, you don't notice it helping, but I have not complained about my back since I bought it! Does wonders! I love it!
5	1352419200	I have been getting regular massages for the past 10 something years.  Well, not as regularly as I would like, given my budget, but I try to go at least once a month.  My main problem is the tight muscles in my neck and shoulders.  I have literally begged my friends and hubby to just pound my shoulder area as hard as they can to try and loosen the pressure.When I finally broke down and bought one of these, mostly based on the reviews on here, I had low expectations.  I couldn't figure out how it worked based on the pictures.  How could the leverge possibly create enough pressure to really get IN to the muscle like I needed?  Boy am I glad I gave it a try.  Yes it looks weird.  Yes it doesn't make sense (at least to me).  But if you play around with it you will fall in love.  I go into a trance when I use it.  I'm FINALLY able to hit the exact spots I want hit, and hit them as hard as I want.  It's absolutely amazing.  And after I do my shoulders and back I go to my feet.  Pure heaven.  Can't say enough!
5	1352332800	This thing works on trigger points I didn't even know I had! My right buttocks was bothering me and thought it might be sciatica.  I started first in the buttock area then pressing near my hip and it felt really tender and my lower back popped! Don't know what happened all I know my buttock pain is relieved. This device comes with a nice info pamphlet. It is the perfect tool for self treatment. I have bought other devices similar to this in the past but this is the best!
5	1352160000	Love how this can get to the spots you can't reach yourself and can really work the muscles and trigger points.
5	1352073600	I read all the positive reviews on amazon and decided to give this product a try.  So far, so good.  I am still learning all the things this can do but WOW,  does it allow you to reach any sore pressure point.
5	1351468800	I bought this product after using it at a friend's party.It's perfect for when you're watching tv or after a long day at work. Easy way to find those hard to reach places and apply just the right amount of pressure.  Designed so you can hit different parts of the body without much effort.
5	1351123200	The Body Back Buddy is a brilliantly designed massage tool. Each knob has it's own specialty and is adept at getting at the body's natural trigger points. If your muscles get tight and sore (I think this applies to everyone), I highly recommend this product. It really helps.
5	1350518400	I have been looking for a good massager for a while, and this one fit the bill! Your able to reach any spot on your back, and it's easy to use this item to work out any sore muscle on your back.
5	1350432000	The Back Buddy is remarkably simple in concept (I wish I would have thought of it first) and while made of a sturdy plastic, is fully up to delivering on its promises for its intended use. Simply put; it says what it does and does what it says. And insofar as I am concerned; it is worth every penny I paid for it.
5	1350172800	Love this back buddy. Sure makes it easy to get to the spots you'll never reach on your own. Very good design and I'm really glad I chose this massager. I thought it was priced very reasonably too. You'll have to try it to find out for yourself!
4	1349740800	I have had only short time but think it will be valuable for me and my pain issues.  This type tool was recommended to my husband and I by PT in Dr. office.  I ordered this (Body Back) rather than Theracane because it looked like it had more massage points and might be more versatile.  Also got the self help workbook and am learning more and more from it on uses and trigger points.  At this point, I think it was a good purchase.  Only negative...I don't think the DVD was worth the additional few bucks.  The additional book purchased separately is much more valuable.
5	1349568000	Bought this about a week ago and have used it daily to massage knots in my upper back.  Worth every penny; very glad I purchased it.  Wish I had bought it a long time ago.
4	1349222400	This product is overpriced but I kept it because it does work. I don't use it often but it's nice to have something to activate those unreachable pressure points in my neck and back now and then. Now I don't need to rely on my wife quite as often. I'll come home from a bike ride and use this device to work out the pain in my upper back and lower neck. I'm sure you could come up with something cheaper that would do the same thing as the Body Back Buddy but I don't have the time to look around or make my own device so the $35 was worth it. Therefore, it gets a hesitant endorsement.
4	1347926400	I couldn't afford to go see a masseur twice a week for my neck and back pain which causes my headaches so I thought I would try this little contraption out. It's a little funky when it comes to design but I do think that it's very useful. I use it 3-4 times a week and in combination with some stretching I feel that it's helped a little. I am happy with it so far and have already recommended it to friends and co-workers who are stressed out and have muscle aches too!
5	1347840000	A great item that works areas that even others can't find. Before, I was punding on my back with a rubber hammer (not so good) or having nephews punch me. The Back Buddy goes with me on trips too.
5	1347494400	Finally!  As a therapist specializing in Sports and Deep Tissue massage, I am often asked by my clients "who works on you?"  Sadly my answer has always been "no one".  I haven't been able to find anyone with the skill level I insist on to perform body work on me.This tool allows me to get at the trigger points in my back, neck, shoulders and even my feet.  It's still not as good as being able to just relax and have someone else do the work, but at least I can get the major knots out.  I highly recommend this product for self-therapy.One word of caution though...If you're not careful, you can do more harm than good by getting over zealous.  Moderation is the watchword here.
5	1347235200	I've had a Body Back Buddy for several months and it has changed my life.  I've practiced self-massage for years and always struggled to reach the deepest knots in my back and shoulders without causing stress on my other muscles trying to reach them.  Using the Body Back Buddy I can precisely reach the exact muscles that are knotted and hurting the most and apply as much pressure as I want, without having to contort my body or strain other muscles doing so.  The "side-by-side" knobs are perfect for working out all those hard to reach muscles in the neck and lower back.  I wish I had one of these years ago.  If you're thinking of buying one, don't hesitate!
5	1347062400	I have my doubt about this product. But let me tell you, it works. Very clever invention. I usually dont write product review. But after I finished using it, I decided that it deserves some positive comments from me. Get it, it is a good investment. You will not regret it.
4	1346803200	Great relief for muscle and ligament aches do to tension and over work. I had chronic pain of muscles, tendons and ligaments because of  some bulging discs in my upper spine. When I use this tool to put pressure against those sore areas, my pain goes away. It is the best substitute for a body message and helps me stay limber and pain free. Best use of my money in a long time.
5	1346716800	It's taken me over a month to get around to writing this review simply because I have been too busy using the Back Buddy. It is AMAZING!I saw my massage therapist use one at my chiropractors office a while ago, then stumbled upon this one on Amazon. I asked my Chiro if he could order one, he said sure, for $75. Told him I saw this one for $35, he said to try it out.It takes a little getting used to, and a lot of trial and error to use it correctly, the instructions are just a bunch of pictures of someone using it don't worry the learning curve isn't steep, but when you find the good spots... it is great! The "S" curves are a little tight for bigger people, I'm 6'2" 275lbs and it just fits me. And I ruined a good suitcase stuffing it in on a trip. I see they have a portable one which may go on my wish-list.So what are waiting for, buy it already!
5	1346198400	The back buddy is the best! It gets in those spots you cant get to and allows you to apply as much or as little pressure as you need. As someone who suffers with chronic neck and back pain the back buddy has been life changing.
5	1346112000	During a recent travel trip carrying a heavy back pack, I strained my trapezius. I ended up suffering for months with daily constant tension and pain. Anti-inflammatories and pain killers prescribed by two sets of doctors werent helping.I didnt have the money for private physio so after some internet research I purchased this tool. It really works! I was able to locate the trigger points in my trapezius and after applying heavy pressure for a minute on each one I could feel them "release". After about a week of 10 minutes of daily use my pain and tension had really subsided now about 80% back to normal!
5	1345507200	I bought this for my husband after seeing it used by actors I work with.  He has terrible neck and back pain which has required many medical treatments.  At home we have tried everything from a tennis ball to different massagers, and none of them truly relieved the pressure until this item!  He went to youtube and watched a few videos to learn how to use it and absolutely loves it!
5	1344988800	I bought this as a gift for my wife but I end up using it a lot, too. It takes some reading of their material to fully understand how to use it - or, more accurately, where to use it. But once you get that basic understanding, you'll find that you can easily and quickly relieve muscle tension and soreness.
5	1344384000	I couldn't imagine how this would help get rid of trigger points on my back but decided to give it a try. It is much, much, much better than any electric device. It actually reduces or gets rid of painful knots. I can easily reach them and apply as much or as little pressure as I want. My physical therapist recommended not only manipulating a knot with it but also applying it with a lot of pressure against a trigger point for 15 seconds. The latter technique seems to get rid of the trigger points even faster.
4	1344384000	I bought both the backknobber and this unit.  I use the backknobber at work, because it can break down into smaller size and looks clean.  However, the backknobber will come apart if you press really hard for deep tissue action (it unlatches itself and shoots 1-half across the room).This is where this unit will accel and you don't have to worry about blowing it up.  Another thing I like about this unit is the more aggressive cone-point on one end, oppsed to a ball-point.-1 star:  This thing is UGLY omg, it looks like a sex toy and I do not want to be seen in public with it.  I know 100% that other dudes will be ripping on my way more than the normal looking backknobber.
5	1344211200	would never in a million years have guessed that this little thing was capable of so much.  whoever invented it is a goddamn genius.  It's fantastic...especially if you get knotted up easily in your back - this thing will make you cry.
5	1343779200	I bought this for my constant neck pain.  My neck pain stems from my trapezoids and the muscles under my shoulder.  The back buddy allows me to put accupressure on those knots and helps relieve the tension. The various types of knobs are hugely helpful.  My only gripe is it is to big to put in my suitcase.  I would try to carry it on the plane but I am afraid they might think it can be used as a weapon.  I am thinking of buying these for Christmas presents for everyone seems to love it who try it out.
5	1343692800	You'll be surprised at the tense muscles you can find with this wonderful instrument!  I use this for the knots I get between my shoulder blades (the ones I just can't extinguish with my foam roller).  It also does wonders for my glutes and hips.  Granted, it can't completely replace my wonderfully painful deep tissue massages but it does give me a lot of relief.  If you are looking at this you probably have some sore knotted muscles.  I highly recommend giving this a try.
3	1343520000	This product does what it is supposed to do, however it is large and difficult to store.  If I buy another, I will choose a smaller version that is easier to manage.
5	1342656000	Bought this based on all the previous good reviews. I was surprised on how well it works. I would recommend it to anyone having back or neck tightness.
5	1341964800	If you ever find yourself having a sore thumb from digging into your lower back to reach that elusive trigger point, then do yourself a favor and order the Body Back Buddy. It is amazing. It allows you to dig into those spots you just can't reach otherwise. I use mine all day and night. You will not regret this purchase.
5	1341532800	I like it, I use it as a more advanced way to work on these knots by myself besides using tennis balls on the ground.  You can use a lot of pressure on them and it seems to work great.  No long term information yet.
5	1341446400	The body back buddy was not the 'classic' black/grey version which was pictured - it was the next version in blue.  But I am still very pleased with the product and the seller.  I would buy again from this seller.
2	1341446400	The pointed edges are too sharp. This thing didn't help my back pain at all. The pointed edges hurt. I would not buy again
4	1341360000	This product does exactly what it promises to do. I have found it somewhat effective, and might be more so if I had purchased the trigger point book that is meant to accompany it.
5	1341273600	So glad I discovered this product! It's more effective and simpler to use than any of the electronic products I have tried for releasing trigger points and relieving muscle tension.
5	1341273600	If your significant other is horrible at back and neck rubs like mine is this product fills that void.  It's obviously not as good as a real massage, but provides great relief when that's not possible.  This product is made from durable plastic that will last a lifetime.  Well worth the low price.
5	1340841600	I love it. LOVE IT. If you could not stop wiggling a loose tooth as a kid I think you will like using this to poke and prod your recurrent and/or recalcitrant knots.I have shoved pens into the space between my neck and shoulders and practically THROWN myself into corners of walls to try to get sufficient pressure to the right places without much, if any, success. Especially the neck part. With this tool I can reach exactly the spot and maintain constant pressure. It gives primal relief in places you didn't even realize were knotted.It is very sturdy plastic. I believe it will last for years. I will throw away all of the little gadgety tools I have purchased over the years.I love it. I may even buy one for my office.EDIT: I have had this product for a little over a month and I still love it. It really increases blood flow after you release pressure and you can dig it into the problem areas (mine are my neck/upper back/shoulders)and hold pressure easily. If I intend to sit for any length of time at home I have it with me to work on my knots. This is a VERY effective device.I have several favorite parts of this device, but I would have to say the curved part with has two round nobs with a space for your spine between is my favorite. After a day of work my neck is often killing me and this works quite smoothly on the back of your neck AND IT DOESN'T PULL THE BABY HAIRS which just completely obliterates all pleasure one can receive from a nice neck massage. It doesn't pull the baby hairs even without fabric or oil.My one critique would be the shim lines which still remain after manufacture. Even though they are very small, tiny even, they can still be felt if you use the knobs on bare skin. They are easily whittled down with a razor blade.
2	1340841600	This product is bulky and obscure. Not very useful and easy to use. I bought it, tried it and it's been sitting in the closet ever since. I would not recommend this product.
4	1340841600	Tennis ball or the end of a horizontal bar would serve pretty well also. But it's solid, serves a good function, I like it pretty well. I am 6'3", 200 lbs if the weight matters, it fits and wraps around my frame easy.
5	1339200000	You know exactly where your tender spots are as soon as you 'hit' them.Apply pressure for several seconds, relax the pressure, then apply again.It really does work; helps loosen 'knots' in neck/shoulder area.My husband is very happy, I no longer bother him about massaging the sore spots.Body Back BuddyTrigger Points (Quick Study Academic)I have not tried doing reflexology yet but will in time.
5	1338940800	This item workes great!  I bought it for my girlfriend so she could rub her back right where it hurts instead of sending me on the drunken directions trying to find the spots that hurt! Great item for guys and gals all around. I steal it from her occasionally and use it on myself after long shifts or big fires, it really hits the spot!!  In short, GREAT price, GREAT item!  The end!!
5	1338768000	I love the Body Back Buddy!  It hits all of the points that hurt or have knots in them.  It is second best to having someone else work out the kinks!
5	1338249600	The Back Buddy is an easy to use aid in relieving tight muscles and trigger points that cause you pain. Designed to get at any area that is of concern and you can take it with you any where.Thanks
4	1338163200	I am a licensed physical therapist asst., who has specialized in myofascial release (gentle, sustained pressure techniques to release adhesions and realign the spine, neck, and pelvis).  If you want a tool for home use or even in your practice, this product is TERRIFIC for releasing adhesions and tight areas in the body.  I personally own and use this product myself, as I was in a car wreck in 2010, and have a spinal fusion from T7 TO L1 (with two Harrington rods and 10 screws).BACK BUDDY PROS:1) WELL CONSTRUCTED device, made of STURDY, THICK plastic material.2) Has BOTH smooth, rounded points, as well as angled/pointed knobs to allow for less or more intense application of pressure.3) EXCELLENT for HARD TO REACH AREAS - this product, as compared to the 'Theracane', offers more points and an additional 'curve' to target hard to reach areas on the back, thus allowing many more options for use.4) Comes with an easy to follow instructional guide which is EXTREMELY helpful, especially for those who are not familiar with how to use this type of device.5) Has points spaced out PERFECTLY to target BOTH sides of the lower back at the same time (as well as precisely place points to target both sides of the neck).6) Lessens the need to go to a physical therapist if used properly.7) REALLY WORKS to break up adhesions in the fascia for pain relief!8) Cost is reasonable.CONS OF THE BACK BUDDY:1) The product is undoubtedly STURDY, but is a bit on the HEAVY side.  Be sure to read the instructions, and maybe even see a therapist so that you use this product properly - If not used properly, you will fatigue OTHER muscles during use, and that could result in adhesions in other areas.  Try your best to RELAX when you use this product to get the best benefits.  Let your body weight do the work for you instead of 'pulling down' with your hands to apply pressure.2) As compared to the 'Theracane', (which I have also used), again, the Back Buddy is heavier and more cumbersome.  If you have good range of motion and want a lighter tool, the 'Theracane' may be a better option.  Keep in mind, however, that the Back Buddy exceeds the Theracane because it has more points, and if your range of motion is limited, the Back Buddy is a better choice due to the 'extra curve' that will help to reach places easier.
5	1337990400	I have always had neck and shoulder tension issues.  I got interested in trigger point massage therapy, and it had been working very well for me.  Let me tell you, it is SO much easier to complete the trigger point massage with this tool.  I used to have to contort around and give myself a pretty hearty arm workout by the end.  But when I use this product, trigger point massage is exponentially easier.  And because the angles mean I don't have to work as hard with my arms, I can do the massage more quickly and with better quality than I ever could before.Though I can't speak to the usefulness of this product in comparison to others of its kind, I think that anyone would be pleased with this item if they are interested in trigger point massage.  It is some of the best money that I have spent!
5	1337904000	I purchased this for my husband as a Christmas gift as of yet he still has not used this item.  I saw this advertised on Dr. Oz so I thought it would be something different and maybe nice to have. Does it perform well I don't know seeing that it has not been used. That is why I  reviewed it as nice concept.
5	1337472000	I have severe pain my in neck and back with calcium build up in the tendons that are spongy and crunchy . With the BBB I can place it on pressure points and apply light pressure to help me crack an ache in my joints that I could not do with out it . Now it can take away a negative pain and have a mild positive pain while doing so that stops instantly when you let up . The balls on it do help to massage tight muscles . It has done more for me than 7 so called doctors and a chiropractor combined . I suggest using it very easy with only slight pressure and you will have to find out where your sweet spot is as you can easily hurt yourself if not careful .I plan on getting a second one to mod with padding and submit once I have a prototype that I am happy with . Padding will be removal able .It should have came with instruction DVD that I bought from another vendor . I had two friends think it was a sex toy when I showed it to them . Would like to be able to remove the balls and have multiple places the selection where to screw in .I quit wasting money going to my chiropractor as he has hurt me and I had to teach him how to unstiff me . I have done it so much and tested many ways I have it down to a science and have helped others who went to him better than he could and did not hurt them .If you have stiff joints this is a great item to help you stop the pain . I hated how pills made me sick and it was easier to deal with pain than throw up . Be real easy and learn how it works for you as I have used it all over with testing in various stages in the range of motion I can move and been very glad I bought it
5	1337472000	We use the Body Back Buddy everyday. It is easy to use on yourself and really work on those sore spots that are hard to reach. You can use as much or little pressure as you like. Well worth it!
4	1337472000	This product works like it says it will. It is easy to use. For people who live in all over chronic pain, it is not without some strain on your hands and wrists to deliver the necessary pressure to your trigger points, but it is worth the effort.
5	1337299200	Following a search and in-depth review on-line of similar products, I purchased theBody Back Buddy(+ the DVD) as a gift for my daughter, who suffered neck/shoulder/back injuries in an auto accident several years ago. Periodically, she goes for trigger-point injections, which seem to provide some pain relief, albeit for a limited duration.  (In between times, she can often be seen attempting to reach around & press with her fingers on certain points in her shoulder/neck area.)  Anyway, I was hoping and praying this would prove to be beneficial on a more regular basis, based on user reports.  Well...  virtually from within a few minutes of taking the item out of the box, she was able to use it to reach those same points & exert deep pressure which provided some immediate pain relief.  She's raving about the gift, & wondering why neither her Dr.--nor other professionals from whom she's received treatment, e.g., therapists--recommended same.  Surmising they might not be aware of the product, she told me she plans on informing all of them about it--perhaps even doing a "show and tell."  So, based on my daughter's reaction & experience--who, by the way, is a highly educated, working professional despite her disability--I'd have to give this product the highest rating possible--5 stars!!  (And thanks to the inventor/manufacturer for such a wonderful product.)
5	1335657600	I purchased this Back Buddy because I have this muscle in my mid back that spasms every few weeks for a day or 2. It is very annoying and right where I can't reach. The Back Buddy hits the spot and the pain is over much more quickly now.
5	1335312000	Easy to get it on those hard to get spots!  It makes me happy to have something that can release those knotty trigger points without me having to go beg a friend to do it or get to the chiropractor/massage therapist.
5	1335139200	My friend recommended I get this for my back since he loves his. I am SO happy I bought it. I actually find I use it on my feet more often than my back. For the first time I can actually reach all the sores spots on my back and feet and apply just the right amount of pressure. Buy it you won't be sorry.
5	1335052800	I work in a physical therapy clinic where we have a Theracane (TC) at our disposal.  The Back Buddy (BB) is by far superior in design compared to the TC.  The BB is stiffer in use, has more usable accessory knobs in addition to the 2 hooks, has a second, smaller hook for a different angle, and has a cone shaped knob in addition to the round knob.My main issue with the TC is that it flexes way too much when you're really trying to dig into a knot with the hook.  The way the BB is designed actually makes it structurally stiffer so you can bear down as hard as you want without it flexing noticably.
5	1334966400	I had tried my friend's TheraCane for shoulder and neck pain and after reading the reviews, I chose the Body Back Buddy instead.  I like the extra knobs and the fact that it has a more pointed knob and rounded knob for different amounts of pressure.  I do not regret my decision or the few extra dollars the Body Back Buddy costs, although the TheraCane works well too.  It is quite a conversation starter when people see it sitting on my couch.  My friend who has fibromyalgia and my Aunt who is a hairstylist and has back pain both thought it was helpful.  I have finger numbness and shoulder and neck pain and the BBB has helped a lot.  I also use it on my feet when they are sore.  It's my husband's new best friend, because I'm not constantly asking him to rub my shoulders or my feet.
5	1334966400	This is an awesome tool.  If you have ever had trigger points in spots where you can not reach - this is your answer (short of a massage therapist).  You can get anywhere on your body with various tips on this tool.  Great tool to have for relief of trigger points or areas that you want to massage on your own but can not reach
5	1334448000	My massage therapist recommended this tool as an acupressure device I could use on myself. I bought one soon after and it has really helped me get to the knots I develop around my upper back and shoulder blades. I was so impressed with it I convinced my boss to get one for our office and now I hear people singing its praises all the time.
5	1334102400	I bought this for my brother for Christmas. We have a connective tissue disorder which causes chronic pain. Specifically, he has incredible pain in his shoulder, under the shoulder blade. For years, I have watched him press his shoulder into walls, doorknobs, and window frames to find some relief. Even though I thought the Body Back Buddy was a little expensive, I'd done my research against similar items, and thought it was the best choice to give him.He wasn't sure what to make of the contraption, at first, but after putting it to use, he was blissed out! When his family wanted to test it, he acted like Gollum with his "Precious", pulling it to one side in a "Mine!" maneuver. No one else is allowed to touch it. He wanted to give it a name, so he could confess his love to it over and over. We finally decided on the name "Prince", because it looks like the symbol that (the artist formerly known as) Prince uses now. (I can't believe I just typed that.) So, now when speaks to me, he just tells me that "Prince is still serving him well", or he "still can't go a day without Prince". LOL!He loves it so much that I bought the smaller (purple) version for myself. It arrived yesterday. I also bought a trigger point book to go with it and it's fantastic! I feel the same way about "Princess". HA! Mine...all mine!Yes, it was expensive, but relieving that kind of pain is worth every penny. I feel that this tool is sturdy and will last a long, long time. It's well-designed and that's worth paying for.
5	1333929600	I love this! Gives me the leverage / angle to work on areas that are tight from working on computers so much. BREATHE! Get one for your loved ones or yourself and you will feel much better.
4	1333756800	I picked out this tool because it had a the most knobs of any other tool that I found.  I think it works great.  Admittedly I don't use all the knobs but it gives me all the options I need for my own issues. The only problem I have with it is all the knobs have a crease down the middle of them, which can be a little uncomfortable if you press down hard on bare skin.  This seems like an obvious thing the manufacture should have addressed.  I took a file and smoothed all the heads down and it's much more comfortable.  This tool works great for me but admittedly a cheaper tool with less knobs would probably do just as well.
5	1333324800	I tend to have a lot of tension in my neck, shoulders, and lower back. The body back body is FANTASTIC. I can finally hit all the tension points. I wish it came with a little more suggestions on how to manipulate the buddy but trial-and-error is fine with me.
1	1332892800	This product was obviously developed for women and small framed men.  I purchased it for use on my upper and lower back and I am too thick; I have a large chest structure.  I'm not over-weight.  At 5ft 10inches, I weigh 160lbs but both curves on this device are too small to allow me to use it on my back.  Before I received it I was concerned that it might be too flimsy since it is made of plastic but it is very study.  Too bad it won't work for me.My son has a smaller chest structure and has back problems so I will offer it to him so it doesn't go to waste.
4	1332806400	I would give the actual product a 5 star rating...but I'm giving 4 stars b/c it did NOT come with the instructional packet/book that the site said it comes with...
5	1332547200	This item is the best one for getting to the areas that no one can reach by themselves to relieve muscle pain and tension.  Since purchasing the Body Back Buddy, I have not had to suffer in pain for long periods of time waiting for my husband to come home and message the trigger points for some kind of relief.I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone for this use.  It is fantastic.  It is sturdy, and seems to have all the right knobs in the right places to reach the areas that are in pain.
5	1332460800	After developing a persistent "back of the body problem" that extends from neck to hamstrings & calves I've gone into research & solution mode trying everything from acupuncture (helpful) to assisted stretching (costly) to physical therapy three times per week (not as effective for the cost).  I bought the Body Back Buddy after watching a video on youtube on Myofascial Release/Myofascial Trigger Points... the BBB is AMAZING!!! It allows me to hit my trigger points with very little effort, I feel like I'm standing outside myself giving myself the PERFECT massage.  I'm regaining my flexibility after 9 days of use, I just use it whenever I've got a moment (like watching TV).  I took it to the Pilates studio where I workout and the ladies tried it and fell in love... my boss also ordered herself one from Amazon.I'm generally a complainer, the sort of person who's hard to please, but I really can't find any fault with the BBB, initially I thought it was pricey but that opinion is long out the window because it delivers time and again and my returning strength and flexibility is proof.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.
5	1332115200	It arrived fully assembled in a large but thin box and all of it was lightweight.  A solid yet light piece of durable equipment with 11 therapy knobs, allows me to use 2 pointed knobs to get back under my shoulder blades and apply continuous pressure, almost effortlessly, on knots-trigger points that develop following strenuous work done by my arms and shoulder muscles.  Almost instantly pain dissolves as trigger points are released.  I've received nice deep tissue massages many times before and in my opinion this tool provides equally as effective results on the specific muscles that its used on.  Consider that your pain may in fact indicate the need for a full body alignment to be performed by a decent Chiropractor especially if the trigger points recur in the same area.  Still this tool allows for a quick and convenient solution for curing pain effectively before you're able to get Chiropractic care.  The bodybackbuddy should easily fit in your check-in luggage.  Makes for a nice gift even more so for single folks who don't have a spouse-buddy to request/trade the favor of a love filled massage.  Now off to get a back-scratcher ;-)
5	1331769600	I have a weekly deep-tissue massage w/ a professional masseuse so I know where my pressure points are located and I am in-tuned w/ my body's muscles and tissue. With that said, I recommend this product if you know what you're looking for on your own body.
3	1331164800	This is a sturdy piece of plastic with pointed tips that can certainly be used for a lot of different things, but don't expect to get some amazing massage to the pressure points on your back and shoulders from this device.  Sure, you can use it to massage the back, just as you can use any pointed device to do the same (broom handle for example) but there is nothing about this device that does anything different. Be careful though - it's very easy to bruise the body with the hard plastic points.  The instructions say use no more than 10-20 seconds in one area, but I would say even less than that.I will give them credit for creating an interesting conversation piece however, as everyone who looks at it immediately asks "what is it"?
5	1331164800	I ordered the Body Back Buddy over a month ago as a last resort for a lifetime of middle-back pain. I am in otherwise excellent shape...I run daily, do gymnastics, and lift heavy weights. With over 12 years in the active Army, I've deployed on combat tours, ruck-marched hundreds of miles, and jumped out of airplanes. Sometimes after exercise, I wouldn't be able to breathe deeply due to the middle-back pain, right under my shoulder blades. To get rid of the horrible pain, I tried everything: massage therapy, muscle-relaxer pills, stretching and even tennis balls in socks. Some would provide great relief for a day or two, but I felt the pain shortly thereafter. I read a book called the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook, and it mentioned this type of device. I thought, "Why not? It can't put me in MORE pain, right?"The very first night after I received it in the mail, I used it just like the pictures showed. At first, the pressure was too almost too intense for me, but I kept at it for a few more minutes....all of a sudden, I felt this sort of "pop", and my back loosened up instantly! I was so excited, that I felt around my body for more "knots", and over the course of a couple weeks, have been pain-free! I still use it every couple days to rub out any tiny uncomfortable mini-knots that I feel forming, though.I fully recommend this product.
5	1330905600	I purchased this along with the Trigger Point Therapy book. After reading a little bit about the various points of muscle and fascia that get knotted up I tried using the Buddy on my wife. This really helped her back pain subside. I would recommend this product without hesitation.
5	1330473600	I have had back and neck issues for many years. A friend recommended getting a 'Thera-cane'.  I bought the Body Back Buddy and have not been disappointed.It has rounded and pointed ends on either side for more options. There are several ends to reach painful areas-neck, back, shoulder. Just press and release- much relief from nagging pain. It works easily lying down, standing up or with a partner.The price is right too!
5	1330473600	I am a massage therapist, and I also have a car accident injury that doesn't want to heal.  I used a Theracane before at physical therapy, but I find the shapes on this tool allow more options and advantages to trigger point treatments.  It is a bit big, but following the small pamphlet included does help in managing self-therapy angles. Overall, I am happy with the purchase.
5	1329955200	I have cervical pain, caused by extreme arthritis in my neck, and due to stress from work, my thoracic spine tenses up during the day, so by the time I come home, my back is a mess.  I don't like medication, so I don't use.  And  begging for backrubs from my boyfriend gets old, for him not me... So when I learned about this odd looking contrapation I had to have, especially for the price!  I now rely on this daily.  I can use it for as long as it takes.  The only issue is that where the plastic pieces fused together causes a "plastic line" that caught on clothing or hurt on bare skin, so my boyfriend took his hand held sander and lightly sanded each knob, and VIOLA it's now perfect!
2	1329782400	I bought this because I suffer from neck, shoulder, and middle back pain. I thought this would help and give my poor boyfriend's hands a rest. I find this uncomfortable to use and not particularly effective for my problems. Even using it very lightly, the knobs hurt! Some of them are kind of scratchy, too, due to the material.  I considered wrapping the knobs in some sort of fabric to make it softer, but decided to just return it instead. I can see how this might be helpful who had no other options (i.e. no one for massages), but it just isn't good for me. I've returned mine.
4	1329696000	This is a very well made item.  It definitely does what it says it is supposed to do.  I like that you can use it in hard to reach places.
5	1329609600	[...]That is for all of the people complaining about lack of instructions.  You would think a person would know how to use Google if they are internet savvy enough post reviews on Amazon.Anyway, this is a great product.  It is for trigger point.  If you don't know what that is, educate yourself.  Amazon sells books on the subject or there is always that mysteriously Google that people seem to have forgotten about.
4	1329523200	I have a lot of neck and back pain.  My husband gives me a massage just about every night but he just can't get the right spot (But it stills feel good).  This allows me to hit the target spot but you have to be careful and not press too hard, it can really be painful.  I do find some positions hard to do but that may be just me.
5	1329350400	I've been having pains in my upper back for over a year now, primarily due to the frequent typing/sedentary activities that engage in throughout the day. I've tried all sorts of therapies and medications, all with very limited success. Massaging is definitely one of the best things that help with my pain, but it is not always easy to find someone to give you a massage, especially the kind that involves very specific trigger points. When my doctor first introduced me to TheraCane, I was totally sold on the idea. This was exactly the kind of tool that I was looking for. I looked around for the best combination of features/price, and decided to try out Body Back Buddy. It seemed to be even more functional than TheraCane, and even though I don't necessarily need all the options right now I think it is a worthwhile investment down the road.The feature of the Body Back Buddy that I like the most are the dual "hooks," each with its own spacing and a set of knobs of various shapes and sizes. I use the blunt knob for the more diffuse massaging, and the pointed one of the precise application of pressure. I use this massaging tool many times throughout the day, every time I feel the painful tension in my back. So far it has lived to its promise, and I am extremely satisfied with it.Body Back Buddy is sturdy and well built. At first it seemed too light and I was wondering if it could withstand various degrees of pressure, but it turned out to be more than fine. Its lightweight build also makes it ideal for traveling. Overall, a very well designed and useful product and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get an easy and effective self-massaging tool.

5	1329091200	But it's pretty damn close!  I've been recovering from a shoulder injury, and the Back Buddy has been a great help.  If nothing else, it's a real conversation-starter ;)
5	1329004800	This is a great tool to use alone..:) If nobody is around to hit the spot for you this guy is great. It can reach your back easily without strain. We have 2 in the family now. Great Christmas gift for that hard to buy someone.
5	1328400000	After being turned-on to a TheraCane, I found the BodyBackBuddy on Amazon and have to say it's much nicer in many ways.  What's not obvious with initial information is that aside from the two arcs being different sizes, the shapes of the knobs on each end are different (more spherical or more pointy) which helps for different levels of healing.  The dual knob is AMAZING for working on the neck the extra poles make it easy to simply gain leverage and also tight spots in legs or arms.All-in-all I purchased three of these for myself and two employees and they've basically gone viral due to their simplicity.  This is the type of tool that should be at Walgreens and in a few short years many people would have them at home with the great price level available.
5	1327968000	The Back Buddy is very durable. The quality of the plastic is exceedingly superior and you would never be able to break it. I use it a lot. I would recommend it to anyone who does not have a private masseuse.
4	1327881600	Needless to say, this gadget (and it is a gadget... it's the multitool of muscle pain) isn't something you'll necessarily want to take to Vegas with you, as it is pretty big and awkward. But I bought this due to its awesome price vs. a TheraCane or Hi-Push, which is $20 more for much less tool, and it doesn't take up much less space anyway. It's $30, $35 and you get a little version for travel. $30 is a steal for something this versatile. For those in the continental 48, shipping is like, $8...The selling points are these:-- It's $20 cheaper, or 40%, than a TheraCane.-- Two end arcs of varying diameters, allow for hitting back, hip, thigh, and glute trigger points, something the T-Cane will also do, but not as well.-- Two angled handles jutting out of both arcs allow better leverage for holding and applying pressure vs. T-Cane's perpendicular handles.-- Three shapes of knobs allow differing penetration into deeper or less-accessible tissues, such as the sole of the foot, levator scapulae, and semispinalis capitis. These are also distributed differently on the handles as well, whereas the T-Cane has only one size and shape of knob, spherical.-- It's $20 cheaper. Even if it was identical to the T-Cane, I still think $20 cheaper would make this pretty brainless to go for.Considering points before you hit 'Buy':-- Some like the neater look of the T-Cane, which never was a factor in my decision -- if it works, I don't care what it looks like. The T-Cane's slightly smaller size may also allow it into carryon. But the price difference + added function trump both for me.-- This is a tool made for attacking and releasing trigger points you may acquire in service as a massage therapist/bodyworker. If this conflicts with your own methods for self-care, then no need to buy one. But I've on a few occasions found it useful for pointing out homework trigger point work for clients, vs. a tennis ball in a sock (which works great for certain muscles too, make no mistake). I think for the price in the contiguous 48 anyway, it's a no-brainer.Get it... worked out some calf and QL trigger points a couple weeks ago with this, and it worked a charm. Hit your levator scapulae with this once a day, and your head turns far easier, nice when you're doing a bit of driving running errands with extended time entering SOAPs into the computer. :p
5	1327536000	I saw one of these sitting in a friend's office a while back, and I had to ask what it was. Well, it turns out that I was having one of those days where I had slept wrong, and I had a massive knot in my back. Voila!I don't suffer from this malady often. Perhaps two or three times a year, I get one of those massive knots that restrict my movement for about a week. And then I move on. I guess I always thought it was just a part of life, but this tool has taught me otherwise. I have found that if I really dig one of the knobs into the knot, it helps to relax it and smooth out the pain. I have to be honest, though. A tennis ball in bed works a lot better. But I don't always have the luxury of running home to lay on a tennis ball to relieve my occasional knots. So I keep one of these at work, and it is extremely helpful.I have even found that just because I wake up in the morning with a knot doesn't mean I can't go golfing later in the day.
5	1327104000	The back buddy is such a cool tool! As a massage therapist I recommend it to all my clients! Allows specific work right where you need it!
5	1327104000	This has been one the greatest tools for stretching my neck, shoulder, and back muscles. An inexpensive method for a tool that lasts forever. I have a chronic pinched nerve at C6 that frequently refers pain to my left back shoulder and I use the Back Buddy to put pressure and stretch that muscle. I also use it on my neck muscles that flank my spine. I highly recommend using it on a regular basis if you carry your tension in your neck, shoulders, and back. I've been using it for a couple of years now; whenever I go on a trip for even one day, it goes with me too. A good buddy to have; no pun intended.
3	1326844800	It helps with hard to reach upper back knots, I would like the S- shape to be a bit more open for larger waists sizes however...and to accomodate the buttocks.
3	1326499200	Overall I just don't know how to use this thing. The instructions are not that great. It's awkward to hold and use.
5	1326412800	Great tool- Super versatile. Highly recommended. The only drawback is that it is huge. I was able to work out a knot I'd had behind my shoulder blade in a matter of minutes. Cant say enough good about this tool.
4	1325980800	bought this for my boyfriend for christmas, he had one a long time ago and wanted one badly.  theres not much to it, a piece of plastic- what you see is what you get, but he loves it
4	1325808000	Great item. Covers all the pressure points without paying for a therapist at $85 for 30 minutes. Great remedy for what aches you.
5	1325721600	Being a therapist, I have extensive knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and therapeutic methods of tension release.  Problem is, I can't reach all of these sensitive points on my own body, nevermind have the angle or leverage to apply proper pressure for prolonged periods of time.  With this tool, I am able to do so without having to see a therapist of my own.  The variety of points allows for relatively easy access to most any point of interest on your body.  It is fun to bring into the therapy gym at work and let people play with it.  Highly recommend it, but also recommend education on proper use.  General Tips:  Use moderate pressure over prolonged peroids of time.  Short, quick blasts of high pressure will likely causes more harm than good.  Avoid pushing on bony areas; especially hips and back.  And most important of all, experiment!  The booklet it comes with and online instruction sites are okay to refer to, but everyone is different and has different needs.  Find what works best for you!  :o)

5	1325548800	I have been wanting this for years. I am a licensed massage therapist, so who massages the therapist? She works on herself! This is really nice. I've been working with it since Christmas day and I really like it. It is very light weight but not flimsy at all, it's very strong and sturdy. It's big enough to maneuver around the body for the hard-to-reach-all-by-yourself-places, but not at all cumbersome. I can also instruct my husband where and how to use it on me. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
4	1325376000	Don't have someone to get to those hard to reach trigger pints?  This is your saviour!  A must for those who've found the benefits of trigger point therapy.
5	1325030400	I received one of these this past Christmas after trying one that my mother had ordered, and I have used it every night since, (its only been a couple of days), however, within those few days, the occurring back knots and shoulder knots have diminished greatly. When using the back buddy it really feels like someone is doing the work for you. The design of the back buddy allows you to apply the desired pressure without utilizing the muscles you are targeting.
5	1325030400	I read reviews all the time yet rarely leave one.  This product is worth writing about.  My back always hurts.  I do my best to avoid thinking about it, but it's true, the pain is constant.  I bought the Back Buddy on the recommendation of a massage therapist.  It is an incredibly useful and flexible design that allows me to find all of the sore points on my body (not just my back) and apply acupressure to those points.  It hurts so good!  The relief I'm getting is obvious.  I truly recommend this product if you have muscle soreness and can't afford that weekly trip to the massage therapist.  It costs less than a single visit for a massage or chiropractic adjustment . . . if you're on the fence, don't give it another thought and just buy it - you'll be very happy you did.  This product is a winner.  FYI: It stores really easily.  I hang mine up in the closet with my clothes.  It takes up a tiny amount of space and is always there when I need it.  Enjoy!
5	1324339200	I love using my back buddy! You can use it on your back, neck, or legs.  Instructions really aren't necessary, once you get the hand of figuring out how to hold it.  Just put the little nodules whereever it hurts & massage.  It really has cut down on my back pain a whole lot!!
4	1324080000	My friends all laugh when I show them this thing. I ask them to guess what it is and I get things like 'a yard ornament?', or 'um...a sex toy?'. When I tell them what it actually does, they are dubious for sure. At least until I show them how it works. It really does work (at least for me). I think the hardest part is learning how to hold it. But one you get that down (it comes with a little book to show you how), it like having a LMT at my disposal. I was going twice a months, at $140 a pop (my co-pay was $15). Not anymore!The only complaint (and what holds back 5-stars) is there are a few spots where the plastic molding seam creates a sharp edge. It can make those areas unusable. I can sand them down, but that should have been done before shipping.
1	1323993600	The writeup said that you would get an instruction booklet.  Well, I got the tool with nothing else.  I have no idea how to use this thing.  I wrote a note to Amazon customer service asking if I could get the instructions.  They provided me an email id that wasn't correct (the guy who answered my note didn't know what I was talking about.)  So, it might be a good tool, but I have no idea how to use it....  I will probably return it, but it is so such an odd shape, it will probably cost a lot to return....
5	1323648000	I love this product. It is great for getting out those knots along your shoulder blades, back of your neck and many more. I would suggest this product for everyone, especially if you have back problems. It comes with a how to guide and is very easy to use. I use it everyday after work and then I an able to relax.
5	1323561600	This is awesome! I'm just sad I waited so long to try it.  I've returned to school and study hunched over (or work at a desk)which tightens up my shoulder muscles.  I carry stress in my upper back / shoulder area and the muscles are so tight they 'click' when I find someone to try and rub them.Normally family and friends cannot 'dig in' as much as I'd like or as long. (Cannot afford a $$ massage).  This baby does the trick!  I'm taking it home for the holidays and my sister will likely try to take it.  I just cannot say enough about it.  Try it & you will not regret it!!  Thank You Paul Nash for designing it!Follow the direction, 10-30 seconds at each pressure point. Anymore and your body will respond as if it is hurt.I did it a couple times a day the first time.  Skipped a day b/c I was sore and then used it again but not as long or hard but still found the relief I was looking for.  I had a small headache behind my eyes, didn't think it could be allergies and used it on my shoulders, neck and the headache vanished.If I could carry this with me I would!
5	1323302400	The Body Back Buddy is just as advertised. Firm light weight plastic construction. The design allows you to reach and manipulate muscles with very little effort because you can get plenty of leverage from different angles you don't need to apply a lot of pressure with your arms to get great results. It comes with a helpful booklet to help you discover how to reach and massage many muscle groups including the feet! It does provide quick self relief without having to give someone else instructions as to more or less pressure or up, down right or left. I'm very pleased with mine.
4	1323302400	The Body Back Buddy is perfect for me. The different knobs provide some great relief to my trigger points especially in my lumbar and shoulder areas.  It is a little big to fit in a traveling bag but thats not really a big issue.  I def like it better than a deep tissue massage b/c I can control the pressure myself.
5	1323043200	Though the knob sizes don't vary much the shapes and angles of the knobs provide a wealth of pressure points to address. Because of it's length, there's a variety of different leverages and pressures it can apply unlike the smaller implements. I've gotten the most relief using this implement, I highly reccommend it.
4	1323043200	This is a great product. Delivery was punctual. I owned a Backknobber2 in the past but gave it to a friend as she needed it desperately. I still prefer the Backknobber over this one.
5	1322956800	This product is simply amazing. Works knots just right, tends to muscle aches, and it is extremely versatile.Shipped promptly, which is always appreciated.
1	1322697600	It did not meet my needs as I had thought it would. I'm sure for others it would do fine, but not for me.
5	1322524800	OK, so I expected this thing to suck.  It looks dorky and the person who's using it in the pictures looks attractive and weird at the same time.  Actually, she's kinda cute.  Anywhoooo...I like this thing alot.  I have 2 bulging discs in my back and, because I'm old (late 30s) and run a lot, have lots of ridiculous mystery pains all over the place.  I don't "massage" so much as find the muscular pain, put pressure on it and let the muscle relax.  I usually use it in the morning to get rid of stiffness in my back and legs and it really works.  It's akin to a masseuse finding knots and digging in with an elbow or thumb except this doesn't cost $90/hour.  It's totally worth a try if you have pain like me.  Right now, it's $30 and I think that's a pretty good price. Probably worth it up to about $50.It's very sturdy plastic.  Not flimsy in the least.  When I hook it over my shoulder or around my back and apply pressure pushing forward, it barely bends if at all.  In fact, I stubbed my toe on it the other night and had plenty of choice words (see: "SOB", "MF", "GD", et al) for it's sturdiness.Any questions about it, let me know.
5	1322438400	My therapist recommened this product and I'm so glad she did, I use it all the time and it brings me relieve from sore neck and shoulders.
5	1322438400	The Body Back Buddy was recommended for me by my physical therapist.  I live alone and am on a limited income - so I don't have a partner to help with accupressure or massage and I don't have extra money to hit the spa.  The Body Back Buddy works very well - you can get a surprisingly steady firm pressure on unreachable back pressure points with it, which helps me a lot.  I have severe fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis and this helps quite a bit.
5	1322438400	I used to massage tight back muscles with my hands, but recently hurt my shoulder and couldn't reach my back. This device is easy to use. I think it's great, and you don't have to strain to reach anywhere on your back.
4	1322352000	There are several on the market but this one is a little larger and have more massage options for a little less money.  I can recommend it but no good for travel.
5	1322179200	This is the best tool ever for those pesky knots in my back.  There are 2 S-curves on this massager, one side on the S has a pointier knob and the other has a round knob (for a little less direct pressure).  The pointier knob side is my favorite and I use it to get relief from the tightness and knots in my shoulders.  My favorite way to us it is as shown by the lady in the photo.I brought it into my office last week and my co-workers love it.  A few of them went ahead and purchased immediately after trying, one planned to give it to her husband for a Xmas gift.  Then this weekend my relatives are visiting and the Back Buddy has been in constant use.  We took it with us to my mother-in-law's house because no one wanted to be without it for the afternoon.  In fact, someone even wanted to bring it in the car for the shopping trip we took today.  It's been going through a rotation of people (ranging from late 20's to early 40's) constantly this weekend.  Yes, it looks rather awkwardly large and it's really conspicuous but it's fantastic! If you have knots you want to work on, esp. in your back, get this now.  I still prefer a foam roller for my legs/hips but for my back, this tool is invaluable. It also works great on the pressure points on your feet.
5	1322179200	I love this gadget for its simplicity, ease of use, and effectiveness.  I keep it between an end table and love seat, where it's fairly innocuous, and I can grab it whenever I have back pain.  It works for many back areas and is quite sturdy.
5	1321488000	I just received my BBB and I couldn't be more pleased.  It is very durable and after discovering only a fraction of the many uses for this product, I am convinced that this is the only tool that would ever let you reach those difficult spots (including those sneaky ones that you feel, yet nobody else can seem to find) without having a masseuse.  Also, there are so many resources online to research trigger-point therapy and reflexology.  It's great to have such a simple pleasurable product that also sparked the curiosity in me to learn something I wouldn't otherwise know about.The only con I can think of (which might not even apply) is that where some other massage tools rely on the motion of the tool (like the kneading action of a massage chair, or pulsing of a hand-held massager) This one works much better as a trigger-point tool.  Digging deep into a troubling knot and holding for a few seconds, then experiencing the rush of relief as you let go.  This is not to say that you can't get some decent kneading going.  Last night I spent almost a half hour discovering different spots in my neck, and I could feel the tension slipping away and tingling throughout my entire body.My guess is if you think you might want the Body Back Buddy, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT!!!
5	1321228800	This product delivers what it claims. I find it very useful and extremely effective at leveraging hard to reach places on my body and massaging deeply areas regardless of location. I would recommend this product to anyone who has muscle pain/ tightness and can't afford / doesn't want to visit a private masseuse. Considering what you get this is a great value!
4	1320624000	This thing is great! I have a spot alongside my shoulder-blade that likes to bug me every so often (too much time at the computer, I suppose). I grab my "buddy", give the spot some attention while I sit at my desk and viola! Relief!This might not "cure" a problem (for that, I'd need some structural bodywork, realignment and improved posture and probably a vacation to somewhere tropical), but it gets me through the day and keeps me from "calling out" every so often, when I have more problematic pain. In that, it's a money-saver, in itself!I wish it was a bit smaller (I know they do make a smaller version, but I thought this would be better. Turns out, it's a bit unweildly at times)I wish there was one knob that was a bit bigger. I'm considering attaching a tennis ball to one end, for a more "widespread" touch.In addition to the knobs and balls, I have also used the flat part to massage larger, flatter areas (directionally towards the heart, of course).I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. :)
5	1320192000	I am a massage therapist.  This simple versatile tool, used correctly, is invaluable for relieving tension and pain.  You can be as inventive as you want with it.  I personally like to lay on the floor and lever my body against it to break up really hard areas of tension, such as the quadratus lumborum (the source of many people's low back pain).  With this tool and some practice you can get to a lot of muscles that you just wouldn't be able to get to without a massage therapist doing some deep tissue.Here is how I recommend using it:  an inanimate object is no replacement for hands, so if possible, feel the area of tension with your fingers and figure out which angle (important) to apply the pressure.  Then just maneuver the tool around to that spot, and dig in slowly, making sure not to engage the same muscle you are digging into.  Muscles under tension take time to relax, so be prepared to spend some time on that spot, gradually increasing the pressure while breathing, and feeling again with your fingers for progress afterward.  Less tension or pain, better range of motion, and improved blood flow to the area are all signs of tense muscles releasing.  The spot might be sore afterward which is normal, so don't overdo it.Helpful notes - Tingling and "falling asleep" feelings are signs of impeded blood flow (oops, you're on a blood vessel or vein).  Pain that shoots down a limb and gets worse with sustained pressure is a sign of nerve irritation (oops, you're on a nerve).  Numbness in the area, even after you are off the area, is a sign that you disturbed the nerve by trying to go WAY too deep.I've been using it now for over a year.... the more you use it, the better you get at it, and therefore the more effective it is.If you always find yourself trying to rub "that spot" after a long day, this will help you.
5	1319760000	I keep it near my desk at work and work out tension in my neck and shoulders, a couple of times a day, before it gets bad. This thing reaches any part of the body. No more waiting until someone's available to give you a massage (and by that time, you've already got a tension headache or very tense muscles). I carry it in the car on long trips.For about half the price of a massage, this is a must have. It's big and kinky looking and everyone will ask you about it, but I haven't seen a better-designed product for the job at hand.
5	1319760000	The body back buddy works just as advertised. It's good for working out those tight spots and also if you just need to scratch in those hard to reach places. The one piece of advise that I'd offer would be to get the Trigger point therapy book. It helps show you exactly where that tension in your body comes from and exactly how to alleviate it. Great product (although it does look an erotic toy, something which the Marines I work with have let me know on more than one occasion).
4	1319241600	i have a lot of back pain and this definitely helps reach those problem spots that i never could before. its great. theres not a spot that i couldnt reach. my only complaint is that the round knot should have gone on the end of the large curve instead of the smaller curve end. its a lot more comfortable than the pointier knob.
4	1318809600	This item does get all your pressure points that you cannot reach.  It looks a little "weird" but it does the job.I wish the instruction book was a little more helpful.
5	1318464000	I really wish this was less strange looking. A couple knobs I don't use in particular pretty much make it look like a contorted pleasure toy but it's effective and there's no better way to work the knots in your shoulders and traps. I wouldn't even know how to work those knots in the middle of the back without it, especially with my tyrannosaurus-rex short arms. I bought a trigger point reference to go with it. I recommend that as well but you can find them on your own if you experiment. Currently using this when knots in the traps causes neck tightness and shoulder pain. Also this makes for a great self foot massage too. It's easy to underestimate how much discomfort travels right from the soles of your feet upwards. I've recommended it to friends who once they got over how silly it looks, realize it's effective. That being said, it's better than some gimmick but it's not a miracle tool and not a substitute for physical therapy, medical professionals, and so on and so forth.
5	1318032000	It's amazing how easy it is to reach knots and apply a lot of pressure to knots in my hips and back. Love the design and sturdiness!
5	1317945600	I have knots in one shoulder that have been causing severe pain for years...have been to doctors for injections, chiropractor for manual treatments and electrical stim, have tried ice and heat...nothing worked.  Direct pressure to the area is the only thing that gave relief...but it is in a place on my body that I cannot reach, so had to always ask my husband or family member to "press on it"  for a long time.  I now can use the Body Back Buddy whenever I get the pain and the constant pressure I can apply with the product almost immediately eliminates or reduces the pain.  No more begging for someone else to do it for me.
5	1317772800	I have read the reviews and was kinda still hesitant to buy it. I injured my back at work so I have been having problems with spasms. I have gone to many massage therapists but I cannot find someone who really is a "real massage therapist". My experience with them is unsatisfactory at best they tend to use their elbows and other paraphernalias rather than hands. So with not much else of a choice I bought this one. And I have never been so happy to have this thing massaging myself on the spot where I want it. Good item and very much more satisfying than any massage therapists. So instead of paying someone 60/hr I now rely on this and I have never been happier and spasms free...
5	1317600000	The back buddy lives up to its hype.  Lightweight, accessible to various body types, and well-stationed knobs, I couldn't ask for more.  Overall, great product!
5	1316995200	This tool hits all the sore or tight muscles in my back and neck. No need for physical therapy or pricey massage therapists!
5	1316908800	I work at a computer for several hours of my day. My back and neck were suffering greatly...until the Body Back Buddy. Truly saved me from a chiropractor or weekly massage - all for under $30!! If you are on the fence between this model and its predecessor, choose this one, simply for its ability to provide more options and really get into those tension spots. I use it daily for ten minutes and what a difference!! I haven't had difficulty turning my neck...no pain in the upper left hand side of my back and a difference in my posture as well - all because this product really was well thought out and can get to those "tough to reach areas." Save your back AND your wallet...you really can't go wrong with this one!! Check out the videos to assist in use too.
4	1316390400	The Body Back Buddy is as described and seems to be well-made.  It's a type of plastic, but it's quite stiff and it doesn't flex too much.  The only caveat is that it may not fit individuals with a large chest.  I have a 47" chest and the larger side just barely fits around my chest.  It still works for me, but if your chest is larger than 47", it may be a problem.
5	1316044800	I wish I could work on myself as a massage therapist but its just not possible.  This little tool is great for hitting those areas on myself that I need some work on.  The different textured knobs really help with specific point work.This was worth every penny.
5	1315958400	Perfect name for a great product.  Reaches all those places you need to get to but couldn't before and you control the pressure. It even fits in my suitcase, but not in the carry on type. Worth the money.
5	1315612800	Holy Cow...I don't leave reviews. I order too much from Amazon, because I don't have time to stop and do things like write reviews.  But this BodyBackBuddy...OH MY GOODNESS. One of the best purchases I've made in YEARS. I need DEEP pressure, and my wife's poor thumbs can't always handle the load. But now I can dig out knots that my professional masseuse couldn't get to! I LOVE this thing... considering the mini version for travel, because the only con I can come up with is the size. But it's thin, so I'll find a place to store it.
5	1315526400	I have had neck and shoulder pain forever.  Usually begging for a massage and dragging myself to the spa for one when I have the time.  The rest of the time suffering with neck pain, which often results in a headache after a while.  Saw this a few days again and thought what the heck.  Just came in the mail and tried it out.  Within minutes my neck and shoulders feel fantastic.  I cannot believe I waited so long for this!  This really is one of the best purchases...my family thanks you as well because I don't need them anymore :)  Anybody suffering from neck, shoulder, back pain this is definitely worth a try.  Worked for me instantaneously.  Thank you!!
5	1315526400	I'm a massage therapist and bought the Body Back Buddy to reach the knots I couldn't convince my husband to rub deep enough to release.  It reaches and has different shaped knobs to massage and smooth knotted muscle.  I debated between this product and the TheraCane and hesitated because I thought this would be more difficult to use.  The dual handles make it possible to reach exactly where I need to and I hang it in my closet to store.
5	1315440000	I used this on the trigger points on my back and within 10 minutes as soon as it arrived it and i felt like just had a 90 min massage. I loved it!
5	1315353600	I've been suffering from severe shoulder, back and hip pain for years. Massage relieves some of it, but only is available once a week at most.  As soon as I opened this product, I went to work on hitting trigger points for about an hour and received relief that nothing else has delivered through the years.  It's easy to use, and the little instruction book gives you enough of an idea to begin right away. I also ordered the Trigger Points Therapy Workbook, and though I've not had much time yet to get into it, it points out that some areas can take up to a month of constant work to correct. Knowing that this is at my disposal whenever I need it is a real comfort.  I highly recommend this.
5	1315094400	I suffer from aches and pains on a frequent basis in the following areas:Under my left shoulder bladeMy JawMy right wristMy left footUsing the body back buddy to work on these sore areas and the areas surrounding them, has really helped tremendously!I would highly recommend this as a tool for self care on the condition that, once you get it, use it a little bit at a time, finding out what works best for you.
5	1313625600	I had the worst shoulder and neck pain yesterday 8/17 from sitting in front of the computer all day. I had this pain going on for more than 2 years, but I received the body back today. I took it home and tried it.  I could actually get the points where I needed to most.  It relieves the pain. Please get this when you are in pain. Do not waste your money at massage therapy like me. I spent thousands I mean thousands of dollars.This is my first review at Amazon. Wait This is my first for everywhere.Thanks
5	1313452800	This thing has become part of my daily maintenance.  I was having extreme back cramping from surfing and other heavy activity and once I started using the buddy on a regular basis the cramping subsided and after two-three weeks was gone! 5 Chiropratic visits and 90 minute massage did not work but my new buddy sure did the trick!
5	1313452800	I have suffered with neck and upper back pain for years that I attribute to my very physical job, which requires a lot of pushing and pulling of heavy equipment.  I see a chiropractor and get regular massages which provides some relief, but it never lasts more than a couple of days.  My massage therapist suggested I look into a Theracane but after doing some research, I decided to go with the Body Back Buddy.  I began using it the day I received it and it has done wonders for me!  I agree with some other reviewers that there isn't very good instruction on how to use it, but with a little experimentation I think anyone can get benefit from it.  You have to probe around until you find a sore spot and then use GENTLE pressure to relieve the knotted muscle.  I press and hold it for 10 to 20 seconds on the sore muscle and then release.  I do this everywhere I find a sore spot and then go back and do it again.  I am using it twice a day, morning and evening.  You definitely have to be careful and gentle though, or you can hurt yourself!  Don't overdo any one muscle.  The Body Back Buddy has helped me tremendously!!!
5	1313280000	This thing has given me relief from my neck pain. I have cronic pain in my neck and back for years. My neck pain is not completely gone but it is much, much better. Has not worked as well for my lower back pain, but it does help.
5	1313107200	Wonderful product.  I love it.  I appreciate the S shape (as opposed to the cane shape, without a 2nd curve), because while I'm sitting I can use my legs to put pressure on my back/shoulders (which means I can put more pressure and not use my upper body (stressed) muscles for it.
5	1313107200	Hook it over your shoulder, probe around until you find the tension and then (using gravity alone) drape your arms over one of the extended ends of the device.  Allow yourself to zone-out for about 10 seconds and you will feel your body begin to relax.  I work at a desk all day and have to remind myself to take breaks.Since receiving my B-B-Buddy, I look forward the first signs of tension just to experience the relief it produces!Highly recommended!
5	1313020800	Love my Body Back Buddy [which I still refer to as a Theracane], YES worth every penny, shipped out & arrived quickly, appreciated that they used paper rather than foam or other packing peanuts to ship it, the Theracane is very light & portable, I'm a musician & have been bringing it with me to gigs when my shoulder has been kicking up - I go out to the car for a quick tune-up between sets to help relieve the pain - SO grateful!!! Easily hooks onto stationary objects for more position options (the door-jam, for example.)Easy to use & versatile.
5	1312934400	The product came in an extremely big box, much bigger than necessary.  It's hard, flat plastic--I'm pretty sure it could have survived a trip through shipping without so much cardboard.When I opened the box, I didn't realize the backbuddy was so big!  I'm only 5 feet, so it was a lot bigger on me than the girl in the pictures.  I was really planning to return it because I didn't want something so big and clunky in my house.Besides that point, when I finally tried the BB, it worked wonders!  Even with the size difference, I was able to adjust it so I could reach different places on my back.  I was extremely impressed at the amount of pressure I could exert into the knots.  I can finally exert the amount of deep tissue pressure I've always want in a massage.  I woke up this morning feeling pain/soreness free.  I'm sitting at my 8 hour desk job feeling very good and haven't had to pop any joints yet.  I don't think I'll be mailing it back.  I'll find some place to stash it.
5	1312675200	Pain can make you choose anything to help. Wonderfully, this product is designed to exactly fit your arms, hands, and body. After just a few uses, I found my body quickly figured out how to apply this tool so naturally, it didn't need to be instructed. Best of all, you don't tire working with it so you can relax your whole being. Thanks!
5	1312329600	I've been experimenting with Trigger Point work for over a year now, and this find is a game-changer.For anyone that has been trying to get those hard-to-reach spots by kneading with fingers or leaning into strategically-placed tennis balls and the like, this tool is a must-have.  Something about the design enables amazing leverage right into the sore spots, and you can really feel the difference as blood gets circulating into tight tissue.  Using this has helped me get creative with trigger points that I hadn't even attempted before.Pro's:* They really have engineered the spacing of knobs and shape of the device to be optimal for different parts of the body.* SturdyCon's:* The name: BodyBackBuddy, really? I found myself laughing out loud when trying to explain it to curious friends* A bit big, but necessarily so - I see there is a travel size, but I'd rather sacrifice the suitcase space, and have the full leverage.Definitely a step up from using myofascial release balls! I'd recommend gettingThe Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Editionto guide you, if you don't already have it![...]
5	1312156800	I absolutely LOVE my backbuddy.  I always have tons of knots in my back and this does great for them.  If you have issues with your back, I highly recommend getting this!
5	1311984000	If you have trigger point pain this bodybuddy is what you need, reaches areas you can't. Wish I had known about these years ago.
5	1311897600	i tried at least a dozen therapies and treatments for my shoulder pain after a roll-over car accident, and this is one of my favorites! if you already know that deep pressure on the part of your body that hurts causes you to jump a bit...but ultimately provides relief...this may be the gadget for reaching those difficult places.in case you're on a search of your own for dealing with pain and are interested, the other things i tried were: chiropractor, orthopedics, physical therapy, massage therapist, massage devices, trigger point injections, creams, patches, pills, ice, heat, balls, stretching devices, slings, posture braces, foam mattress pads, special pillows...and ultimately surgery a year and a half later. i still use this regularly on my shoulder, back and neck, for those relentless trigger points that never seem to completely go away.
5	1311379200	Great tool.  Feels great, but just be careful not to massage yourself too long, or, you will end up being a little sore.
4	1311120000	If you're not impressed, please give it a day or two! It doesn't always (never, for me) give instant relief. But it does give relief that will last 48 hours or so! I can't use all the ways it's to be used because I have an unnatural fusion but it's worth it!
4	1310860800	I love this thing. I hit the gym a lot and constantly have knots, but really dont have time to go to a massage therapist.This thing is perfect for someone in a similar situation.I would still recommend a few visits to a professional, but this is great for in between visits.The reason I gave this 4 stars is because the product picture made the Back Buddy seem bigger than it is. I am 6'1" and wish there was a back buddy a little larger. It would make it easier to maneuver even though this one still gets the job done.Also, I wouldn't recommend leaving it laying around if your expecting company. When ever someone sees it they give me this strange as if it was some crazy looking sex toy I left laying around. lol!Overall, the product still works great and I highly recommend!!!
4	1310169600	This product has been wonderful helping me get knotted muscles to relax!  The only con I have about this product is that it doesn't come apart for smaller storage.  Other than that it's great.  I even took it with me on vacation!
5	1309564800	This product really works!  Perhaps a lot of you are familiar with the pain that I'm about to describe: Every once in a while when I turn my neck to the right, I would feel a throbbing pain/soreness shoot from my neck down to the back of my right shoulder blade. I eventually went to the chiropracter after the problem kept getting worse. I suspected that it was probably from the way that I was sleeping because the pain was mostly evident first thing in the morning.The chiropracter did his thing with the biofreeze,massages and also provided his explaination of what was going on. I couldn't understand 90% of what he was saying because he was using too many big words to describe the muscle groups related to my problem.  Nevertheless, this session didn't help much because I was still having pain the very next day.I purchased this BACK buddy after stumbling across and reading all of the good reviews. Within 15 minutes of using this device my neck pain was gone!! Basically what I did was applied pressure directly to the pain periodically for 10-30 seconds at a time. Other than a little soreness from the usage, my neck and shoulder blade pain literally disappeared.This may sound sick but for the past couple days I was hoping that the pain would return so I could have a reason to use the Buddy again. To this day still no pain.But I'm sure at some point the pain will return because I never figured out what was causing it in the first place.Until then, Excellent product. (invented by a chiropractor!)
5	1309305600	If you are looking for a good quick massage that you can do on your own, this is the product.  Great!
3	1309046400	I'm unclear how helpful it is. But it at least provides the psychological satisfaction of reaching points on your back that otherwise cannot be reached.
5	1308528000	I have been struggling with trigger point pain for over 6 months now and am so happy a friend found this for me. I always had to wait for my boyfriend to get home to press on them for relief or dig my back into a corner of a wall, but now I can give myself relief, daily. I'm more than happy with this product and my back is as well.
1	1308528000	My wife bought me this for father's day.  I tried it out several times in all different spots through out the day and evening and to me the whole thing seems useless.  It didn't feel particularly good or help in any way, I had to put some strength into it where my physiatrist says I need to keep my shoulders and neck relaxed. It's a case of 'its the thought that counts' here but I'd never recommend this to anyone. Instead, marry someone who is willing to give you massages on a regular basis.
4	1308441600	I'm not sure where the S-shaped massage tool originated, but the Japanese have been using them for quite a while.  Some of the more modern ones, consist of an S-shaped metal rod, with a small wooden ball at each end of the `S'.  Made of plastic, the Body Back Buddy (BBB) takes this basic idea and refines it, by adding handles and an assortment of pressure points, and nubs to stimulate various trigger points in the body.Some thought evidently went into the design, but the effectiveness of any particular pressure point or technique, will differ between individuals.  Finding out what works for you, is mostly a process of experimentation.  Body Back's website provides additional information, like a pressure point chart and illustrations and videos showing how the BBB can be used, but it's up to you to try different things.  When experimenting with various positions, it's probably advisable to leave some clear space around you, as it is possible that you might accidentally swing the BBB into something.Made of heavy duty plastic, the BBB seems very sturdy, and is backed by a lifetime warranty.  The two straight handles added to the S-shaped main frame, are a good idea, as they provide convenient places to grip and apply pressure.  It may work for some, but in my case, the sharp points usually cause too much pain and chafe my skin.  Jamming a tennis ball on the end of the S curve, provides a nice round surface that works pretty well for on my shoulders and back, which is probably the area of the body the BBB is best suited for.  The sharp points may work better, when there is a thick layer of flesh between the surface of the skin and the bone.While the BBB works pretty well, the story is different for the Mini Self Massage Tool, which is designed for the back.  It's not constructed of the same thick plastic as the BBB, and is more prone to bending when even a moderate amount of pressure is applied.  If you pull on it hard, it feels like it could snap, which might be very dangerous.  Again, the sharp point on the tool causes pain, so I also jammed a tennis ball on it.  The results are a little better, but still not that great.  This tool is more useful delivering soft blows on the back, rather than in applying pressure at a specific point.  If you sit on a chair, put it on your shoulder and lean back with the ball in the shoulder blade area, it can do some good.  The Mini Tool only costs five dollars more, but you might want to get just the BBB alone.With the tennis ball modification, I find the BBB to be helpful in relieving stress and pain, mostly in my neck, shoulders, and back.  It is supposed to help in other areas of the body, but so far I haven't had solid results anywhere else.  The large S-shaped frame does allow you to have the leverage to apply a decent amount of pressure, which can be very helpful in treating pain.  The BBB may work for you as designed, but using it with the tennis ball modification is crucial for me.  I can often get some relief, just using a tennis ball alone.  It's simple to use, inexpensive, and really can produce remarkable results.  While there are many places a tennis ball won't work, you might want to try using one first, before investing in something like the BBB.
5	1308355200	This product is everything it claimed to be and more. I had been going to a chiropractor for a couple of weeks without lasting results. As a rehab nurse I was looking for a way I could be more active in my  treatment. A physical therapist with whom I work let me use a similar product and I was very pleased with it. I looked online and found this product which was more versatile and offered more "little knobs" for greater trigger point release. I am very satisfied with the Back body buddy and have already recommended it to friends and co-workers. Note: it looks a little odd so don't be surprised if you get questions about it.
5	1307836800	This is my new best friend. I always have shoulder and upper back pains and now I can sleep better at night after using this very awesome trigger point massager. And most of all, I can save so much by no longer going to a spa just to have a deep tissue massage.
5	1306972800	There is not much more than I can say except that this item has become my new best friend.  I can finally take charge of my aches and pains and alleviate them without relying on anyone else. On of the best purchases I have ever made!
4	1306540800	while i think the design could be better, i would recommend this for muscular back pain. it provides drug-free relief from pain for me. it's not a cure-all but helps a lot.
5	1305849600	I like the back buddy better than the theracane because it has more options with the different knobs. I especially like the 2 knobs close together for the neck. It is large and looks "interesting", but I would definitely choose it over the theracane for its versatility.
4	1305763200	My daughter recommended this product to me.  She was very happy with her purchase.  She spends alot of time on the computer at work, so this massager comes in handy for those hard to reach back and shoulder muscles.  It's very easy to use, you can apply as much or as little pressure as needed, and it targets the exact muscles in need of soothing.  It reminds me more of accupressure than a massager, as the knobs are small in diameter, but I imagine that you could also cut a hole in a tennis ball & put it on a knob to widen the massage surface area.
5	1305763200	I bought the Body Back Buddy for my dad, and he absolutely loves it.  He has suffered from degenerative disc disease and arthritis for years, and this tool has helped him find some muscle pain relief.  thank you so much.
5	1305244800	Bought this for this in-laws and they use it everyday! They love it and wish they would have owned it sooner
5	1304985600	I say the best because it has 11 therapy knobs whereas the closet competitor has far fewer. The Body Back Buddy stimulates in between muscles and pinpoints trigger points for a more finely-tuned treatment. I have numerous aches and pains since I have fibromyalgia plus I workout a good deal. I seem to always be pulling something or messing something up that causes a good deal of pain. And, in most cases, it's where I can't reach. This massage tool helps me greatly. It's especially helpful for the neck and back but also works trigger points on the feet, hips and other places.Overall length is 25 inches. Comes with a free 12 page instruction booklet. There are also instructions on their website. And there's a manual you can download. Basically, you simply put a knob or knobs on the sore area and massage. The relief you'll feel is amazing.Highly recommended.-- Susanna K. Hutcheson
5	1304899200	I came across this on vacation and thought it was brilliant! Such a clever design; no matter how you use it, it does GOOD work at digging into tight muscles. And it's an awful lot cheaper than regular massages. I was excited to find it on amazon.com.
2	1303084800	I bought this weird shape stick after having read all apprasing reviews. Are all these people real? I do not know what to do with this stick, really. I am thinking of returning it but I am aftraid I will pay too much for the shipping so it will not worth it. I agree with one who wrote that some people are making very good money on this..... I regret that I bought it.
5	1302998400	It works for what I need it (massaging lower back muscles).  And, unlike what some people commented, mine came with instructions, which was attached to the cane itself.
5	1302825600	Wow! This seemingly simple device is able to target every single muscle in my body. Its the only thing I've found that allows me to effectively massage my upper shoulders after a stressful day. Its also much sturdier than I expected--it seems very durable.
4	1302566400	This is an odd tool and gets a little used to but I love it. Much cheaper than a massage theraphist! You should know that this is a "comfortable swedish massage" type device. This is a "dig in deep and make it hurt good" type device. So know it's more "athlete" than "spa".
4	1302480000	I bought this after using the one my acupuncturist lent me for some back aches and cramps, works very good.  Using the same pressure points she uses in a treatment it is a good in between treatments, treatment
5	1302134400	This is a fantastic little gadget. I've had it for years before writing this review, but it was only when I was traveling abroad for 4 months without it that I realized how much it really helps my quality of life. Totally worth whatever I paid for it, and I'm getting one for my dad.
5	1301961600	My friend is a physical therapist and a triathlete who's competed in the Kona Ironman twice. I first discovered it at her place and the first time I used it was amazing! I finally found something that was an awesome substitute from a real massage. I recommend it to anyone!!
5	1301616000	I have chronic back pain from Arthritis, Lupus and Fibromyalgia.  I've tried so many things, including a hot tub, and this product is the best!  I can make my own muscles relax without hoping someone in my family wants to give me a deep-tissue massage.  I LOVE it!
4	1301616000	I use this to message trigger points in my upper & mid back, as well as my upper traps and neck. It's very helpful in reaching otherwise difficult spots. My problems are quite chronic so this hasn't fully alleviated my trigger points but with more use I'm sure it will. I've found this works well with the "The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook" which you can buy here on Amazon.
5	1301356800	This is, by far, the best massage tool I've ever used. Don't even bother with any of those overly fancy massage tools. I've searched high and low for different tools to work on all of the knots in my shoulders and neck, and this is the only one that could help.
5	1300838400	I'm a systems admin and my job requires me to work using Mouse all day long. I have recently started to get upper back pain and wanted to give this product a shot.This is really amazing and it has actually helped to heal quicker.ThanksSri M
5	1300579200	This is a really stupid looking bent plastic stick that really takes away the pain in my back.The best thing about it is that I only had to buy it once and it works and it never wears out!!!Jonathan
4	1300233600	I was concerned about the back buddy being plastic but when I received it I discovered it was very strong and unlikely to ever break.It works well.  I wish it came with a dvd (there may be one you can buy seperately) because it took a few weeks of trial and error to discover how it works best.  I find myself using it 3-4 times a day and it does offer some decent relief.  It is not a miracle cure but it is one more tool in managing chronic muscular pain in the upper back and neck.  It makes the time between massage therapy appts much more tolerable.
5	1300147200	This is a wonderful product.  I purchased it for upper neck/back pain and it is ideal for reaching those hard to reach muscles.  It loosened up my tight muscles and I feel so much better.Well worth the money!
5	1299974400	I am very pleased with it.  It is nice and sturdy and makes getting to my sore spots so much easier.  It's nice how the shape allows leverage such that little work on my part causes strong pressure on the trigger points.  Thumbs up.
2	1299456000	This item does as it says ok. I wouldn't say it saved by back or is as good as other tools that I've tried.It is sturdy and applies nice/decent pressure to pressure points. It's not very good for rolling pressure/"massage". It's shape is a bit awkward for some-- it depends on your size and back height, I suppose. Overall, it's an ok/fine item.. but not a miracle worker. It's a bit tiring and tedious to hit the right pressure points with it. I wouldn't buy it again for my purposes, but the item itself seems to last ok. Just too awkward to use, not relaxing, and can't hit the right spots on me.
5	1299196800	100/100 for the sore points in your upper back, I also love using it for my thighs as well. Not as effective as manual pressure for some areas like your arms and your neck maybe; but still, using this doesn't make your hands tired and need a second message after you massage your body.
5	1299196800	I actually almost sent this product back without even opening it.  Just before it arrived I went to Brookstone and purchased a pulsating massager w/ a lot of power.  It worked so well I figured I didn't really need the backbuddy.  I use the massager almost daily...but yesterday felt like I was overdoing it a bit.  It's super powerful and when I do my neck I literally see triplicate, lol.  Also, even thought the pulsating is good, i didn't feel like it was really getting this particular knot out.  I decided to get the box for the backbuddy off the porch, open it up and try it.  The moment it touched my shoulders I knew it was a keeper!  Very impressive.  Seriously.  I had doubts about how comfortable it would be but I have to say its perfect.  I like a lot of pressure and this thing gives you a ton of leverage w/o having to work too hard.  Very well made.  Def recommend!
4	1298592000	I have used the Body Back Buddy a few times since I purchased it.  It can really get to the spots that you can't reach by yourself.The material is a very hard plastic and I think I would like it a little bit better if the plastic was a bit softer so that it "dug into the spot" better.I know I will use it when I feel like I'm really tight across my shoulders and back and it will help between my actual massages.
5	1298073600	The body back buddy enables one to press on hard to reach trigger points and thereby relieve pain. The booklet enclosed with the product gives several examples of ways to use it. A fuller description is also available for purchase. I find the product easy to use and effective in reducing spasm of pain. It was recommended by my massage therapist.
2	1297555200	I left a previous review for this item saying how I received the item with no directions and just wrapped in a piece of paper..the company contacted me a few days later about rectifying the problem and that the instructions would be sent out promptly.  They further said they would credit me a percentage for my troubles and also asked if I would remove the negative review.  So, I did.  Guess what???  Still no instructions sent to me and, no credit on my account....sorry but that is bad business.  I would think twice about ever dealing with this company again!..as for the product, can't really tell you how it works...don't want to use it improperly and cause more damage then what already exists...
5	1297555200	This device, paired with the Trigger Point book is a wonderful aid for people with chronic knots and muscle spasms in the upper back.  It certainly helped me!
4	1297555200	This allows you to access and massage away trigger points (painful knots within muscles) virtually anyplace in your body). That being said, it can be difficult to find the painful trigger point, and often difficult to massage away the pain depending on the trigger point location. For example, anywhere on the thigh can be easy but near the middle of the back around the lower edge of the scapula can be difficult to find and figure out how to massage.The Body Back Buddy allows the application of massage pressure, and leverage virtually anyplace once you learn how for that location.There are books on trigger point massage that would be a very useful supplement to the rather paltry users manual that comes with Body Back Buddy.
5	1297555200	As the title states, this thing is awesome!  It can't get any better.  The round ball type ends are to mimic a thumb & the pointier ends are to mimic an elbow.  I prefer the pointier end.  It really helps release the tight muscles between the shoulder blades.
5	1297382400	Wow! this product works wonders.  It delivers such exquisite results that it even dulls the pain that comes with the knowledge that I have no friends or loved ones to rub my back for me.  The warranty should last at least until my next purchase, Neck Noose Buddy, arrives.  Oh, happy day.
5	1297382400	I love the back buddy. I have shoulder, hip, neck and low back pain issues almost everyday due to laborious job for 10 yrs now. This tool is very handy, I use it a few times a week at minimum. Can be used in the hot tub too. Very affordable for what money I save by not needing to rush to the chiropractor or for massage, helps my body last longer between doc. visits. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
5	1296172800	I bought the Body Back Buddy after seeing a friend's. In August I woke up to my left hand "frozen". I was unable to move it for a few minutes and even after that it was stiff. I decided to see a chiropracter. After about 10 visits where she did pressure points my hand was better. Unable to afford regular visits, I was looking for something to help me that I could use myself. The Body Back Buddy is it. I find that if I use it once or twice a day, my fingers loosen up. It is amazing. Who would know that the muscles in my neck and shoulders control my hands and fingers. I will keep using this.
5	1296086400	I have back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain. I used to go for massage 1-2 times a week. Most of the time, the massage therapist could not go deep enough into the "sweet" spot. Now, I use this product every day and I can pin point the specific area and press as hard as I want. It is a great design. I study the meridian points and this product has the ability to do 2-3 pressure points at one time. It surely does help blood circulation and the knots on my back are getting smaller. The only limitation of this product is it "gives" a little when I press really hard (Sorry, I like deep tissue massage). Overall it is a great product, I spend more time with it than with my husband!!
5	1295913600	As a single person the Back Buddy has really helped my back.  I know that pushing on painful points in the body relieves the pain to muscles.  The Back Buddy really gets to those areas.
5	1295827200	I love this product, would recommend it to everyone. Shipping was terrible though. I don't think it was as much of a problem with the seller as much as my problems with amazon. It was supposed to come as a gift for Christmas and didn't come until the 30th. Buzzkill.
5	1295308800	I sit at a computer all day and my back and neck hurt all the time.  This product has kept me sane!  Thanks Body Back Buddy!This shipper was very quick to ship, even though I ordered during the holidays!
5	1295136000	I think this is well worth the cost. I'm always trying to reach the knots in my back or making my husband massage them. This makes it easy for me to reach the spots myself.
5	1294704000	I bought this as a christmas present for my wife and could not be more satisfied. When it comes down to it we're talking about a piece of plastic, but it works well and was delivered in a timely fashion. I give full marks.
5	1294531200	The Back Buddy has done a great job of working out the kinks and allowing me to put pressure on the trigger points that release my neck tension. Also great for those tight shoulder muscles.  Spend some time with the included trigger point book, it really improves the experience.
5	1294099200	I have had problems with my back for years.  I've been going to the chiropractor for the past 5 years and they have done a great job.  However, I have always suffered from muscle pain even after having adjustments.  My chiropractor had the backknobber in her officer to sell but I wanted to do research on it.  I'm glad that I did because I stumbled onto the Body Back Buddy.  It seemed to be a much better quality and it is.  I LOVE MY BODY BACK BUDDY!  It really gets the tightness out of my muscles so I don't have to go to the chiropractor as much.  It is well worth the money which is less than 1 visit to the doctor.  This is the perfect gift for someone with ongoing back pain.
5	1293926400	I bought this for my teenage son who works out a lot and has soreness frequently. I myself have scoliosis and have daily back pain, but I am sort of used to it. Anyway, I woke up this morning laying on my back and when I tried to get up I was hit with painful spasms in my back that made it virtually impossible to move. I had to call my husband from the other room to come help me out of bed. Anyone who has experienced spasms knows how painful it is and it is very hard to even find a comfortable sitting or lying position. If you move just wrong, it'll send you back into intense spasms. So I'm on the couch trying to find a comfy way to sit and I thought of this gadget. I had my son bring it to me and started applying very firm pressure to different spots on my back. When I finished, I found that I could move much more freely, without any more spasms. Now, it wasn't a 100% cure, but it made my day much more pleasant and I was able to move around and do everything I needed to. What a relief! I am a believer.
5	1293840000	I ordered this on the recommendation of a physical therapist who thought I might benefit from Trigger Point Therapy.  It is extremely sturdy and easy to use.  It took three weeks of working with it and while I won't say I'm "cured" I will say I no longer take pain pills daily after eight years of suffering with back pain.  I am also going to get the Travel size Back Buddy for when I'm away from home.  It was well worth what I paid for it and I've already recommended it to a friend with similar problems!
5	1293667200	The S shape allows you to get leverage to really work those sore spots.  The handles are placed right where you need them to help work it in.  The nubs are also well placed to allow you to work them into places like the back of your neck.My wife won't go anywhere with out this.
5	1293494400	Im not as young as I used to be. I often wake up in the morning with knots or stiffness. This product has worked wonderfully well for me. I had a few knots that been around for a few weeks. I used this product three times a day for three days and they were gone. I got full range of motion in my arms after that.
4	1293235200	Like many other reviewers', my BBB didn't come with a "12 page instruction booklet". It came with a small (2" square) 4-page advertisement for itself showing an athletic woman in Spandex holding it in various ways and smiling, with no text description of what she was doing. I put it aside for weeks, afraid of hurting myself trying to use it without knowing what I was doing.Eventually a severe back spasm led me back to it in desperation and I started gently "playing" with it. I was surprised to find that it's relatively intuitive, despite looking intimidating. If you've ever used a kitchen counter or table corner, square support post, or doorknob to rub your back against, the same instincts apply here -- you just have LOTS more options. Position some knob or another against a sore spot, apply gentle pressure, and wiggle. After a few seconds you'll naturally gravitate toward the motion and degree of pressure that feels good and helps. It's a little slow (I use it while watching TV or doing something else) but inexpensive compared to massage, and with practice you can get very good at controlling the amount, type, and direction of pressure -- something that can be difficult to communicate to another person.The length can make it cumbersome but also provides what I see as its greatest strength: you can get excellent leverage by positioning one hook-end knob against the target muscle, holding it one of the side protrusions with one hand while moving the free end back and forth with the other. By taking advantage of it as a lever with multiple potential fulcrums and choking up or down with the moving hand, arthritics and fibromyalgics like myself can manage self-massage with minimal strength applied and very little movement. With a few days' practice, I learned to get significantly more benefit from the BBB in proportion to strength and energy exerted than any other self-massage tool I've tried -- that is, whatever area I've targeted feels much better without causing my arms or hands to feel just as bad in trade-off.For more pressure, position yourself so that the weight of your limb or body is resting on the applied knobby-bit; unlike a tennis ball or knobbler, this gives you pressure from below with control from above -- that is, you don't have to have your hand contorted underneath yourself to move it back and forth while resting your weight on it, nor is there a need to move your whole body back and forth, both of which can be very tiring.The length also makes it versatile while sitting, if you have room to swing it around yourself. I've managed to rub my neck, back, arms, legs, and feet, all in the same position on the couch, over the course of an hour-long TV program. If I hold it properly, I get a bonus hand massage in the process.An excellent product, minus one star for lack of instruction. It's referred to in books I own which give more technical advice than this, but one shouldn't have to buy an additional $30 book to avoid letting an item sit in a closet for not knowing how to use it.
5	1292976000	Great for getting those touch to reach spots in your back between your shoulder blades!I would highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from muscle tightness in their upper back.I'm sure it's great for other areas of the body too, but this just happens to be the particular part I need to work on.The easiest part is that you leverage your own body weight to apply the pressure - so YOU can decide how soft or hard to press on the trigger point.Very happy with this product WHEN I can find the time to use it!
5	1292803200	This is a fabulous product.  I always have knots in my back, which are difficult to get out, even with massage.  With this product, I can work on them comfortably for a short period of time every day.
5	1291680000	Hits the Spot!Great quality, very pleased!Fast shipping.Buy this odd-looking, yet extremely handy device if you have a hard-to-reach spot that needs attention. Especially useful for the back. for those who need to regularly massage out tense areas in the muscles, it's a very useful tool- and cheaper than therapy!
2	1291075200	A friend of mine had one of these that was made by a different manufacturer. I had tried hers and loved it so began searching for one of my own. I found this one and I must say, I do not like it nearly as well as others I have tried. It is not as easy to use and I didn't like the material and shape of it, it just didn't feel right for some reason. I would not buy this particular one again.
5	1290816000	This crazy looking tool is wonderfully effective in relieving sore, knotted muscle pain in my back and neck.  I lift weights, and occasionally over do it.  This thing saves me having to go to a chiropractor.  I would suggest to anyone thinking about this thing to do a little research (internet) on trigger point therapy.  Knowing how to "dig in" to a sore spot is helpful.  I'd also recommend you take it light the first few times that you use it, as it can make you sore if you over do it.  I'd also stay away from the video that goes for about five bucks on amazon.  It's worthless.  If you or someone you know wants or needs frequent deep tissue massage, particularly in the back and neck, this is the ticket.
5	1290124800	Could not find this product in Australia and am so glad I made the effort to post it from the US. The body back buddy is so brilliant I dont know what I have done without it. Finally I can give myself muscle relieg.
5	1290038400	The Body Back Buddy is great.  This is the only device I have found that allows me to pinpoint a tight spot in my back to work it loose.  This is perfect for use in between massages.  It is much better than using the door jamb.  I can easily massage my feet also while watching TV.
5	1289952000	This product is just what i needed sitting here at work typing all day...my co-workers are using it as well.  hits all those tense shoulder spots and more!!Thanks
5	1289865600	Able to reach my back just where I wanted and provide the leverage on it that I wanted, and feeling the release I wanted, I smiled.
5	1289433600	Years ago I found an S shaped device, made out of brass, with a wooden ball affixed to each end. It was wonderful for reaching those knots of tension in the muscles of the back, neck and shoulders.  I used it on many friends, as well as myself. I was never able to find another like it. I knew it was from Japan, and I had ordered it from a Kind oh Hippy health catalog, back in the '70s or 80s.This Body Back Buddy accomplishes the same thing, with a few innovations.It has several "handles" attached to the S shape, which, with a little practice, help provide leverage and helps the user to reach that "Sweet Spot" of pain and tension. It makes it more manouverable.On the down side, the Back Buddy is cumbersome and large. Which Is good, I guess, in case one of my guests tries to smuggle it away from me after seeing how well it works.
4	1289347200	i ordered the Body Buddy to work on painful areas. Am awaiting instruction from my physical therapist to use it.
5	1289174400	This is a great product. A friend has a metal S hook product that has 2 different size wooden knobs on it that got me interested in the concept but this product is the best i have found. you can get to any point on the body you need to and apply whatever pressure, at almost any angle, you need. Its a great value!
5	1289001600	I wish I'd bought one of theses a year ago when I first heard of it. I still think $30 is pretty steep for a piece of shaped plastic, but I never found it cheaper elsewhere and now that I'm walking out the door pain-free, I'm gonna say it was worth it. Definitely recommend that you buy this in conjunction with a foam roller to help stretch out the muscles after digging into them.
4	1288656000	I bought the Body Back Buddy after a friend of mine let me borrow their Thera Cane, which I loved.  I bought The Body Back Buddy thinking it would be superior to the Thera Cane due to the advanced design.  However, now having used both, I would have bought the Thera Cane instead.  With that said, I do use my Body Back Buddy often.
5	1288569600	this is a great tool for the home and office. I am a busy mother, who sometimes doesn't have time to go for a massage. After 3 uses, this tool pays for itself. Go easy on the first time you use it. You would not be able to treat all the knots on your back with one session. Limit yourself to 30 minutes on the back, if you go more than that, you would be causing damage to the muscles. One session every 3-5 days is enough to start and then once a week, and then biweekly, and later as you need it. Great invention!!! it melted the pain away while I watched TV.
4	1288569600	Very good to relief the pain in the neck and lower back but not as easy to use as the Body Back Buddy Mini.  It takes a little more practice.
5	1288137600	I just got this and used it for only a few seconds before I said out loud "why didn't I buy this sooner?"  It is rigid enough that I can use a lot of pressure and perfectly shaped so I don't have to push too hard to get there.  Fantastic!
5	1287792000	product purchase was for a dislocated shoulder.  it is helping reach those hard to get at muscles that needed to be worked on.
5	1287619200	This is the best money I ever spent. It actually replaces getting a message @ $85 an pop. You control were you want to put the pressure on and it relieves my pain. Love it.
5	1287532800	Not only did I get this 2 days after it was ordered, this thing kicks knots to the curb.  Love it!!!
5	1287360000	This is an awesome tool that anyone interested in sports or someone who has muscle issues should invest in.
5	1286496000	You can reach any part of your body and work out all the knots. You can even do some foot reflexology.
5	1286323200	Even after my grown son had recommended it to me, I was a sceptic about this product .  I have severe muscle spasms which require deep tissue massage on a regular basis and steroid-cortisone shots at times.  The BBB works so well I can visit the massage therapist much less frequently and stay "on top" of my pain as well.The design allows the user to control the pressure and hit the trigger points and sore spots very easily.  I also have problems with arthritis in my wrists, but this sturdy device allows me to leverage it for maximum pressure with no difficulty.  Sitting in a car can be particularly painful to me, but using this during car rides has helped me immeasurably.I can't say enough about this heaven-sent product.  I LOVE it!!!!!
5	1285804800	Have you ever found yourself leaning onto a blunt object, such as a corner of the wall, in the attempt to work out a knot in your shoulder/back?  Have you ever asked someone to push their knuckle on that same spot as hard as they can?  If so, this item is a MUST!  The original thero-cane is great, but this S shaped trigger point releiver gives you a few more options.  The smaller curve has a round knob on the end, whereas the larger curve has a little more pointer knob for a different pressure point experience.  The great thing about having this available is that you control how the amount of pressure you apply to your trouble spot and the size allows you to reach any area in need of attention.  You won't have to beg a friend/family member to lean on your back and insisting they can lean harder...with this, you have control and can keep the pressure for as long as you feel necessary.  Don't hesitate, just buy it, it's worth the money...your back will thank you!  The only negative for this is if you travel a lot (and travel light), it's oddly shaped so fitting it into your carry-on would probably be impossible...but it would fit in a regular sized suitcase.
5	1285545600	I've had trouble finding anything that would actually help my chronic pain.  After ordering the body back buddy it was shipped quickly and I am finally able to relieve and not just mask [like pain meds do] my pain!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCT!
5	1284940800	I am a 45 year old male, surfer, tennis player and excercise enthusiast. I use the body back buddy daily, accompanied with stretching and rolling on a six inch diameter mini basketball. I find that this self therapy softens and relieves my myofacial trigger points that harden up after stressful events, or after hard excercise sessions, primarily around my upper back, shoulder, and trapezius muscles.The greatest advantage of this wonderful device is that it is there when the episodes of discomfort require massage, or direct pressure.  My life is much more relaxed and comfortable by using this tool. I use it sitting down, lying in bed, or standing. It has numerous applications, is portable and extremely durable/unbreakable. I can get the needed leverage from the two straight handles.  I cannot speak more kudos for this life enhancing device. My fiance uses it and so does my mother who now swears by it. She had an awful muscular attack one night around her shoulder and neck areas. I drove this up to her and it was the only massage tool that relieved her suffering! She would not return it to me! Therefore, I had to buy a second one for myself. LOL!! Absolutely No regrets with this tool. I recommend it for anyone us suffers from muscular tightness, trigger points or soreness.
5	1284768000	THE BODYBACK BUDDY WAS WAAAAAY BETTER THAN I EVEN EXPECTED.  IT GETS ALL THE RIGHT SPOTS IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT AND IF YOU EVER HAD KNOTS MASSAGED OUT, PRETTY MUCH SERVES THE SAME PURPOSE. I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP WITH MINE HAHA! BEST $30.00 I'VE EVER SPENT.  IT WAS IN GREAT CONDITION TOO. I WAS AFRAID I'D HAVE TO SAND SOME PARTS DOWN BECAUSE A REVIEW PREVIOUS, BUT THIS ONE IS IN PERFECT CONDITION. SHIPPING WAS GREAT AND WELL TAKEN CARE OF. THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!
4	1284681600	This is a great tool for those with frozen shoulder problems as I have.  I was surprised though to find that one of the protruding handles was broken off when it arrived.  I have not contacted the seller about this because it still works fine for my needs.  I did not want to interrupt my use of this product to ship it back and wait for a new replacement.
5	1284681600	I am a Physical Therapist and saw so many people experience relief with this that I decided to sell them in my clinic.I do wish that they did not look so "questionable" because they do get some funny looks.
5	1284681600	I love this.  I can get to any spot on my back to put pressure on the sore points and just work it out!Thanks.
5	1284595200	I'm very pleased with the speediness of the shipping and the quality of the product!  Thank you very much!
5	1284163200	I purchased the Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Massager about a month ago as my lower, mid & upper back was stiff from running, as well-my piriformis was aggrevating.  I am preparing to run the St. George Marathon in afew weeks and I just did not have the finances at the moment to get a massage like I generally do.  I did various back, glute and piriformis stretches and self-massages in addition to my regular running stretches but I still felt the aggrevation especially as I increased my running miles. After I received the Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Massager--WOW! I was able to fully reach the various trigger points in the glutes, piriformis and along the back areas from the lower back to the upper back areas and the shoulders and neck areas with ease.  Even though I did various stretches for the piriformis and back prior to getting the Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Massager I did not really look forward to doing the stretches but with Body Back Buddy Trigger Point Massager I massaged the trigger points easily and quickly and did not have to wait until post run to stretch, I was able to massage at work during down time as well as at home.  I feel ready to run the St. George Marathon.  RJ
5	1283990400	Wonderful tool, it's like the next generation leap from the theracane.  I have weak arms and hands and find the theracane difficult to grip and maneuver (have had it for at least 15 yrs.  The Body Back Buddy has a flat surface to hold on to and it is much easier to grip as a result, is extremely lightweight but not at all flimsy.  The knobs are well positioned and the pointy knobs are a great tool to have as well.  This thing is awesome!  I'm coming back for the mini to bring it to work!
5	1283212800	My husband had a knot/spasm in his back that would NOT go away for weeks, even after physical therapy and muscle relaxers. Out of desperation, he found this product online and decided to give it a try. After several days of working the knot in 5-minute sessions and then resting, the spasm finally subsided and he's back to normal again. This is well worth the $25 or so it cost!
5	1282780800	This thing has not cured my trigger points but when they get acute this is the tool I go for first.  After a few minutes of working the trigger points they usually relax and my pain level drops 2-3 points on the 1-10 scale.
4	1282089600	I brought this little guy (actually, it is quite large) with me when I went on vacation to Montana.  It was an 8 hour drive and by the time we got there I had developed a pain in my left shoulder blade.  I couldn't even pick up my kid.  I got out my trigger point manual and went to work on several trigger points with my Body Back Buddy.  Within 20 minutes my pain was barely noticeable.  The next day it was gone.Since then I've used this on many occasions to work on the adhesions around my shoulder blades and mid-back.  Sometimes I think it would be better if there were little removable rubber pads on the ends of the knobs as sometimes it can be a bit painful.  But all-in-all, it works just fine.  I'm considering getting the smaller version so I can use it while at my desk at work.
5	1282003200	I have terrifically bad right shoulder pain - around the scapula.  This area is hard to reach and other than going to a chiropractor or a massage therapist, there was just no relief available at home - that is, until I tried the Body Back Buddy.  My daughter, who is a rock-climber, has a similar product that she swears by, so I decided to order one for myself.  I use the rounded knob end to massage and press along the scapula area and also to massage around the back of my neck.  Within minutes, literally, I have relief and by the end of the day, I have full range of motion in my arm and shoulder area.  Works for me!!!
5	1282003200	I bought this for a knot under my right shoulder blade that burned and ached almost constantly for three weeks. I had been asking my 8- and 5-year olds to elbow my back, but they weren't around half the time and also I didn't want to keep bugging them. This device is easy to use without help. You can easily apply a lot of pressure to a specific point and even move it up and down. So far I've used the knobs on either end for my back. I must have grabbed it 20 times in the first two days. After about 10 days, I noticed a significant difference in the pain level, and now it's gone. Of course, I've done stretching and sat in the jacuzzi a few times, too. Anyhow, I was so miserable that I thought about going to a masseuse, which is great to do but pricey and provides temporary relief (with only one appt.). Ideally, you could see a masseuse a couple times and use this as a supplement. Even alone, though, this device did the trick for me. Regarding the documentation, it comes with a short pamphlet that simply describes where to use each knob. I don't think more extensive documentation for the device itself is needed. If you want to learn about pressure points, then you can buy a book and use this device as the tool.
3	1279843200	Eventually you get tired of it. I used it like mad for about 2 weeks and then it became one more item cluttering my home. Get it only if you are disciplined enough.
5	1279238400	Back buddy is definitely my new buddy!It can reach all the places that are hard to get on your ownwithout a massage therapist. Whomever invented this is a genius!The different shaped nobs (one more round, one more pointed)are really great and can totally relieve painful trigger points.So glad I found this!
5	1278288000	I have knots in my neck, upper back and scapula area that I just can't get rid off and bought this after reading an article about trigger points...muscles that have been in spasm so long they form knots.  I've been diagnosed with myofascial pain syndrome and use this every evening or morning after taking a hot bath and it helps to relive the pain temporarily.  I have just begun medical treatment and I need other care to deal with the knots, but the Back Buddy has been a great adjunct.
5	1278201600	This looks like an instrument of torture BUT it's an instrument of well being.  Last year, I purchased a book on Acupressure Points.  It suggests laying on tennis balls to reach important points in the back.  HA HA HA!! RIGHT!The Back Buddy is designed to reach vital acupressure points on the back.  You determine the intensity of the pressure.I have a large bone structure so I was very happy to read another review on the less expensive Back Buddy.  A PETITE lady said it was perfect for her.  If you're not petite - this one is perfect.No more uncomfortable knots in my back, shoulders or hamstrings.
5	1277942400	I have fibromylagia, therefore I tend to be sore all the time. I am always desperate to ease the pain. Especially in my neck and shoulders. This gizmo really does the trick! I have problems with my hands, so I worried that it would be hard to hold onto, but it isn't. The Body Back Buddy really gives me the deep tissue pressure I need. I have taken to calling it my "boyfriend", because try as he might, my husband has never been able to work on my painful areas like this contraption can.If you have the need for deep pressure to release tight, sore, muscles I highly recommend this product!
5	1276473600	I would highly recommend this product. I have tried many different massage devices and none of them have compard to this one. The knobs on this item give you a very deep massage that really opens up the muscles and takes the knots away. You only need to apply a slight pressure for a deep massage. And since there are so many knobs, it is very easy to get every part of your body. My mother has very tights knots in her shoulders and this was a lifesaver for her.
5	1276041600	This is the most amazing tool that I have ever owned!  I highly recommend it to anyone who has body pain.
5	1276041600	I love my back buddy!  I ordered this one for a friend because her husband got the one she had in the divorce.  We both agree that the pressure point therapy using this tool works better then any messager on the market (I've tried many).
5	1275955200	I ordered this a few months ago.  I suffer from tension/stress along my left shoulder blade.  It causes extreme pain throughout my left shoulder area and radiates up my neck and into my frontal chest.  I've tried various devices and even a neck pillow to get relief.  Nothing worked until I got the BBB.  It took about 1.5 - 2 weeks of daily (several times a day) use, but now I'm completely pain free.  Now, when I start to feel the least bit of tightness or twinging, out comes the BBB to the rescue.  This thing is platinum to me.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
5	1275436800	The best thing that has happened to me in awhile.  My physical therapist recommended it to me.  She must have too many clients....or is a true professional.  Anyway, I don't need her anymore!
5	1274832000	When I was contemplating whether or not to buy this, one of my main concerns was the quality of the material. I also wasn't sure whether to buy this or the TheraCane.After receiving this in the mail, I am very pleased with the quality of the product. It is somewhat heavy and the plastic feels very strong and solid to me. It is not cheap toy plastic for sure. I talked to one of my friends who has tried TheraCane as well as this one. He said the TheraCane is too short and due to the bigger curve, it was more wobbly/flexible than back buddy. So I am very happy that I went with this.It is very easy to use and can be held in any way you like to reach hard to reach places on the back by myself.
5	1274313600	This works great to get knots out - just be careful how much you use it at one time. It felt so good the firts  time I used it, I kept going for too long and was really sore the next day.
4	1274227200	I've known I have trigger points for years (Thanks, Clair Davies!), but since I have a Knobble, a boyfriend, and some sharp edges on my granite countertops, I thought a Back Buddy type tool would be redundant.  How wrong I was!  I've been having a lot of tension headaches lately, and finally thought I'd give the Back Buddy a try.This incredibly bright blue tool arrived larger than I had imagined.  It's great for digging into all sorts of area that the booklet doesn't illustrate.  For instance, sit at your kitchen table, using the table to support the Back Buddy ,and lean one of the long pokey parts into your neck to apply pressure to your sternocleidomastoid muscles.  You can also balance the tool on the ground, kneel, and lean into the same pokey bit to massage sore hip muscles.  Be creative!  I've used it to help stretch and to unplug an item behind a large appliance.When not in use to massage sore muscles, you could probably also keep it around to club a burglar in the night.Oh- and be forewarned: It has an incredibly phallic portion that *will* provoke your friends to inquire about your actual intentions for the tool's usage.
5	1274140800	This funky looking contraption is named Body Back Buddy appropriately.  When used with the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook by Claire Davies, you can take control of your own muscle health.  While its named for the back, this fabulous tool can be used on any part of your body.  It's the best way I've found to get control of those hard to reach places with the least amount of effort and the most leverage.  You definitely need this in your self-treatment toolbox.
5	1273881600	I get so tight in my neck and back, and it's hard to massage that away by myself. This thing looks funny, but man, it packs a punch. The pressure points are small, so be careful if you're not into deep tissue. There are pointed spots and more rounded spots, so if you like it on the lighter side, use one of the rounder spots. I use both. I tied a satin sheath over one of the protruding "branches" and that works great for sliding the thing around (over a shirt/blouse), without "sticking" when it comes to the plastic/skin contact. I can get rid of the tension in my neck and back very well with this thing. It sometimes hurts the day afterward, and I don't care. I just use it again, and the muscles are loose again.If you like it gentle, be careful with this. If you're like me, and aren't that delicate, then get this thing. It's well worth the $20.
5	1273449600	I've been imagining having something like this for some time, it does reach those unreachable spots very nicely.  I am finding it to be like exercise equipment though, it sits on the sideline unused a lot..though it does work, and help a lot when I use it!I bought this one instead of the other brand because it had the extra curve and extra bumps, but I don't think I'll ever use the extra ones because they are so sharply pointed.  The rounded end is good enough for me.  I'm even thinking a softer/padded add on might be a good option for some people??I'm sure I'll be using this more as I get used to how to use it.  It's a good product for pressure points/ trigger points/ foot reflexology, don't expect a "gentle massage" feeling.
4	1272153600	I love it, but the "j" shaped openings don't seem as big as on one I used at physical therapy.  I am a pretty big guy so I would have liked to see the openings a bit bigger to reach my trigger points.That being said, it is a great tool and I would buy it again in a second, it was worth every penny for trigger point relief in my mid to upper back and under the edge of the scapula.
4	1271894400	this tool is very easy to use to reach those places on my shoulders and back that i cannot reach with my hands.
5	1271894400	I purchased this Body Back Buddy for my Mom but before I gave it to her I used it for a couple of weeks. Man, I loved this thing. I have a spot under my right shoulder-blade that bothers me something fierce. It feels like it's on fire. My Chiropractor can't fix it and my wife, although she makes it feel much better, doesn't not have the power to press the spot as hard as it needs. The Back Body however gets the spot really well. Nice design, simple to use and very little strength is needed to make it work. This will definitely be going on my Christmas list.Oh, and one more thing. One reviewer said this was made of cheap plastic. That couldn't be farther from the truth. I put tons of pressure on this unit and there is no way anyone could break it. It flexes ever-so slightly but I think that's a good thing.
5	1270339200	I have been an avid gym rat for 20 years and participate in many sporting activities.  I frequently get knots in my neck and back and have to make appointments to the chiropractor on a regular basis.  Not only is it an inconvenience during a busy workday, but the health insurance co-pay does add up.  As soon as i heard of the Body Back Buddy, i had to buy and try it.  I IMMEDIATELY felt a release in the knots and pressure built up in my back and neck and use it on a daily basis whether i need it or not.  It is a an instant relief for any muscle knotting and stiff back and when you don't have a spare set of hands to use, the Body Back Buddy is a savior!
3	1269993600	I like this item, but I think it would have been better if it really had the 12-page instruction booklet that is supposed to be included with it. That booklet is why I bought this product instead of others.
4	1269820800	Works great, exactly as expected. My only complaint would be it's weight and ample size, but it's not an issue.
4	1269561600	after having a few physical therapy session for lower back and hip pain I found this on web blog and figured i give it a try. It has help me and its great for rubbing out knots in my back or sore muscle well worth it
5	1269388800	Puts pressure where I need it! I love that I can do my own trigger point therapy! Who knows my sore spots better than me? I have upper back pain right underneath my shoulder blades due to cubicle work. This gets it every time.  And unlike chiropractic visit, there is no time limit.  I call the shots! It's awesome. I purchased this tool based on my co-worker's recommendation who recommended this tool to him. If you have back pain due to sore muscles, I would definitely recommend this!
5	1269216000	My massage therapist told me to get one of these, I can say its amazing for someone who has lots of knots in the back and shoulder area.
4	1268611200	This funny looking apparatus does work. It will reach the trigger points in your back and there is no doubt when you hit them.  To use it properly you need to also get a book on Trigger Point Therapy. I have the one by Clair Davies and while technical,it tells you what you need to do. I also have the small theracane but it can't compare to what this unit can do. Overall it is well worth the price at half the cost of one massage.
5	1268438400	The upper right quadrant of my back is really messed up, with a couple of major pain trigger points.  One of my best friends had one of these and I had toyed around with it a few times and was impressed with how effective it was.  Then a few months ago I started getting regular manipulations from a doctor.  She recommended that I get a Body Back Buddy to help loosen up my back and shoulder.  Along with a roller foam that I use to help arch my back a bit, it has helped reduce the pain in my back.I frankly can't imagine anyone not wanting one of these.  If you have pain, it will help you deal with it.  But even if you don't have any spots where you have actual pain, it will help you relax and stretch.  And heck, it just feels good.  And the Body Back Buddy is so well designed that it can be adapted for just about any spot on your body, from the arch of your feel to your upper or lower back, to your calves, to the back of your neck, to your upper shoulders.  I strongly recommend using the BBB in conjunction with one of the books available about pressure points.You should definitely get one of these.  Yes, they work.  A bargain for the price.One other thing.  There is a similar product, the Theracane.  I have toyed around with both.  I definitely recommend the Body Back Buddy over the Theracane for a couple of reasons.  One is that the double hooks, one ending in a ball and the other ending in a sharper point, to give very different kinds of pressure points.  I just found that you could do more things with the BBB than the Theracane.  Though frankly, either is going to do your body a lot of good.
5	1268352000	My husband, bless his heart, is not good at giving shoulder massages.  My trapezius muscles get SO tight and sore and this is the first thing that can really work out those kinks.  I've tried the electronic massagers but they never got the right spot.  I highly recommend the body back buddy.
5	1267660800	The more you use it, the less you actually NEED to use it!! It releases the tension build up within a few hours of using it. I used to have terrible pain at the base of my head and neck, and since I've been using this, I am able to prevent the pain from getting worse after one use! Everyone who has tried it, wants one of their own. I definetly recommend this for anyone who has hard to reach pains!!
5	1267574400	Body Back BuddyI purchased the Body Back Buddy from Amazon especially for my wife because she has fibromialgia and a lot of trigger points in her back that she can't reach to ease her pain. she says it works great and  loves it and since i don't have to wear out my fingers pressing on her sore spots  i love it too.  Michael Coughenour Butler,Pa
2	1267401600	I use a Thera Cane at work alot. I work in a dental offcie and so my back is full of knots :(.What I don't like about the back buddy is it's handle.It's square. It's uncomfortable to use. I should of returned it and got a back buddy.
5	1266537600	This is awesome for those of us who suffer from knots in hard to reach places.  You'll need to take some time to familiarize yourself with how to use it, but it's worth it.  Build quality is good and should last for years.  This product really helps you take away the pain.
4	1266537600	This is the perfect tool to reach anywhere you have a knot. It doesn't come with a manuel but you can download one from the manufacturer's website. The main thing to consider, however, is that it is rather large, so if you're looking for something more portable you should chose one of the smaller versions.
5	1266105600	The Body Back Buddy is an excellent self massage tool. It was easy to manipulate to reach each trigger point on my body. It is a little awkward to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, it can be used easily. I use mine after every work out!
5	1265932800	I am constantly battling knots in my shoulders, and the Body Back Buddy is just what I need to get relief at the end of the day. The BBB is sturdy and well designed to allow you to work over most tight spots that are out of reach. The curved hook for shoulders alone is worth the price! I use it everyday, and I'm always finding new ways to apply it to different muscle groups. I am a triathlete and I use the BBB for post-workout recovery from longer or intense exercise. If you buy this product and a foam roller, you are going to be in great shape.
5	1265846400	After reading "The Trigger Point Therapy Book," I purchased the Body Back Buddy to work on my trigger points. I unfortunately got a little to harsh with the use of the Back Buddy...my nerves became inflamed. But I know now what pressure it takes to loosen the trigger points, especially in my back. Now I don't have to spend so much money going to massage or chiropractic.
5	1265328000	This has made a huge difference in my life!! I keep telling others about it, but I can't even get my husband to try it.  It works!! It took a couple months of consistent use for me to finally get rid of the back pain I have had for years. I would suggest also buying a book on Trigger point therapy. I bought two: The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Edition (Paperback)by Clair Davies and Trigger Point Therapy for Headaches & Migraines: Your Self-Treatment Workbook for Pain Relief (Paperback) Valerie Delaune (Author) . What I have gleaned from these is that you have to learn about your own body. For me, I can trigger migraines when too aggressive in my neck and head and can only use my hands lightly for these. The back buddy I use for my shoulders and back and use ice afterwards when the pain is more acute, its a learning process. I want to emphasize this, we are all different and you need to find what works for you, how much pressure, how long to hold the trigger point, how often to use the Backbuddy etc.  The book is great because many times the trigger point is NOT where the pain is. After sitting for 2 months, when I was off work due to back pain and migraines, I ended up with some low back pain and some leg pain that also responded fairly quickly to the trigger point therapy since it had not been chronic. Acute pain ( new onset) may respond quicker than pain you have had for a long time. What I am dealing with now is  because I stopped using the back buddy for 6-8 weeks at the end of the year because I had no pain, and my migraines had stopped!! yeah, but they came back, so like I said this is a process of learning about your own body. I guess I need to use the back buddy for maintenance when not having pain. Now, one month after the migraines started up again, and the back pain, the migraines have decreased considerably, but I still have many tender trigger points on my back. I was originally using the backbuddy for 30-60 secs for each trigger point when I first bought it August of 2009. This time I did not want to trigger a migraine since I was so tender, and started with 10 seconds. The books state 10- 60 seconds. I am now doing maybe 10-20 seconds and it seems enough. Another important point from the book is if pain is only on one side of your body you need to use the back buddy on BOTH sides. One of the books also states the trigger point should not be over a 7/10 pain with the back buddy- lighten up if too intense of a pain. After 3 months off and  returning to work last year , my feet also hurt and I had a muscle at the side of my knee / calf that felt like I pulled it and hurt frequently. It took a couple months, but this pain also went away and the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook was necessary to know where the trigger points are for these areas. Now, I just go across my shoulders, down my spine and under my scapula and any other area on my back that is sore. Low back pain though has trigger points in buttocks and hips that the book really helped with identifying.I have waited 6 months to write a review, so I could give a thorough review. I have had Migraines for about 20 years, they probably started earlier but were not frequent. I always had headaches, so did my Mom and sister. After working as a nursing assistant for 4 1/2 years after high school then another 30 years as an RN, I did manage to protect my low back, which is a common back problem, however my upper back, neck and shoulders ache. I have gone to massage for about 10 years and just tried to manage the migraines and ignore the back pain, not realizing how much ignoring the pain would be an issue. Finally last year, it became so bad I literally could not move without starting a migraine. Just standing up, going to the kitchen made the pain go from a 2 to 6/10 and taking a shower made it go to a level 10/10 pain. I ended up in Physical therapy for 2 months which helped me  identify the cause of the pain which was just lifting my right arm. My whole time in Physical therapy was spent on relaxing the muscles with me having to ask for exercise after the first month, when my Doctor asked how much I could lift etc. I always thought physical therapy was about exercising, but my muscles were too tight I guess and they spent the time trying to relax my muscles. the first exercise I tried, I could feel the pain down my neck and down my back when I lifted my arm and pulled down with resistance.One physical therapist did spinal mobilization which helped me a lot, but its difficult to find someone trained in this. On my last day, I asked how I was going to manage the pain. It was better but not totally gone, and my massage therapist said my muscles felt so much better, but I could still feel the pain. The physical therapist suggested the theracane, and when I searched this on Amazon  the Back Buddy came up also. This has made a HUGE difference in my life !! It is not expensive and even the books I mentioned are not expensive I especially recommend the first book  Trigger Point Therapy Workbook, . The Backbuddy is supposed to come with instructions, but mine came with nothing and I looked it up online and the information that comes with the Backbuddy  is very minimal. I think the book is essential to understanding Trigger Point therapy and how to use it to manage your pain. The books actually arrived a day or two before the backbuddy which gave me time to read first. Even though I ordered it all at the same time and I have Amazon Prime , I could not get support to understand all the products should have the same arrival date :) It worked out ok anyway. Now I am looking at The Original Backnobber II for travel ( it comes apart ). I use the point on the Backbuddy that points inward. I like this more than the round one and the Backnobber II only has the round ends, but it may be better than nothing. The Backbuddy is a bit large for travel, depending on where you are going.  Hope this review helps, The backbuddy has been a lifesaver for me and I wish I had know about it years ago! I am using it in the morning and in the evening while I watch TV :)
5	1265241600	I ordered both.  I honestly prefer the Body Back Buddy but I wanted one for work and one for home.  The Body Back Buddy is better, stiffer/stronger and has more options but it's pretty phallic looking in some ways so I keep the Theracane at work.  These things work remarkably well on your shoulders and neck.  Just go easy or you'll bruise yourself because it feels so good.Highly recommended.  I use mine regularly w/ my Homedics Shiatsu Pillow and my shoulder problems have disappeared.  Get both the pillow and a cane like this and you'll be amazed at how well they work.
2	1265068800	I bought this item expecting to use it for my back but it didn't come with an instruction booklet which was supposed to be included. Now it's a useless item. I wrote to the company who made it but they didn't even respond back.
5	1264896000	I have had to pay a massage therapist a great deal of money to target my trigger points.  Now I can do it by myself!  I love this item!
5	1264809600	Personally I've never seen something like this that was actually effective!  I love this because it gets that knot next to my shoulder blade perfectly.  I got both, I think I like the blue one best because it has pointy edges and it is easy to use.  Though I borrowed someone's dvd on the instructions on the green one and it (though an incredibly old film) really gave me the best angles for the everything the green cane can do.  If you don't read the booklet that comes with it or watch the video you won't even get half of the use out of it.  It is fantastic.  I highly recommend.
5	1264118400	The Body Back Buddy is by far the best hook massage tool in my collection for a number of reasons.First off, I also own the standard S-Hook as well as the Theracane and from my experience with all three, this one is the winner by a long shot.The S-Hook's main advantage is the ability to take it apart, which makes it very compact for travel purposes. But even still, I like to take the BBB with me unless compact space is absolutely critical.The Thera-Cane's main advantage is its simplicity. It is one-sided and fairly light-weight compared to the BBB.Now for the real review, the Body Back Buddy has many advantages over the above mentioned tools.- 11 knobs in assorted sizes and shapes from small to round to pointy- Large enough to command and control comfortably- Handles are angled for better leverage compared to other tools- Can use on practically every muscle group from abs, chest, shoulders, whole back, quads, hams, feet, neck, etc...- Great conversation starterSummary:When I say I take my BBB with me everywhere, I mean EVERYWHERE! It's that awesome! I'm at a computer for 10 hours-a-day almost every day and before I found the BBB, I had a hard time releasing tight muscles and trigger points. Although I did have the S-Hook and Theracane, I found myself not using them as much as I do the BBB. My best guess is that it just wasn't as effective and I quickly got tired of effort required. It's true that you can use your body weight and larger muscle groups to leverage the pressure on the aforementioned tools, but the BBB is just much better at it.I especially love the pointy knobs for really digging into deep trigger points in the back, shoulder and feet. The center knob does a great job of releasing tension in the Multifidus muscles along the spine all the way up to the back of your neck.TIPS:- I highly recommend picking up The Frozen Shoulder Workbook and the Trigger Point Therapy Workbook if you're serious about learning how trigger points affect your body. The combination of the BBB and those books make a highly effective solution if you suffer from musculoskeletal issues. This combination helped me recover from a severe snowboarding accident as well as empower me to help myself AND learn about my body.- There are so many creative ways to use this tool, years later, I still discover new uses!- Try using the handle knobs to get your chest, abdomen areas. I've noticed that people often just ignore the handle knobs, myself included in the beginning.- Breathing is crucial to getting that "release" or "squishing" on trigger points. Try to breathe and massage synergistically, focusing on expanding the area you're working on with the breath.
5	1263081600	This was a gift for my daughter. Her chiropractor suggested it for her. She loves it.
4	1260835200	This is a good device for getting to those knots in your back.  The material is has just the right flexibility and the two different size hooks are just the right size.  I do wish one of the knobs were larger, but they are good none the less.The only con I would say about this product is that the instruction manual leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, just using it you will figure it out.
5	1260662400	I have mild scoliosis, and have had a history of a ruptured disc in my lower back.  I've done well until this past year.  In April, I had a return of sciatica.  Many tests have not shown anything "physical" to explain the often incapacitating pain.Along with medical pain management, I have added massage therapy.  Recently, after a therapist spent hours trying to get the knots out of my back, he recommended that I look for this tool, as a way to help massage my own muscles between visits.What a godsend!  A few minutes several times a day seems to give me hours of pain relief.  It looks funny, and I suspect that my husband does not quite believe me when I say its for back massage, but hey.Its not expensive, not high tech, and helps a lot.  What more can you ask for?  Stores easily in a closet or under the bed.I have recently found a dual use:  My dogs are afraid of it, and I have found that if I lay it on the couch, or up on counters,(or wherever they go where they are not supposed to be), they will avoid the forbidden area completely.So massage your muscles, and train your dogs at the same time.
5	1259107200	This is one of those items that has the appearance of "snake oil" but isn't.  It's an amazing product.  While it's really great for "spot" issues, if you put some lotion on your back and use ball end, it's pretty incredible for an entire muscle region.  Totally surpasses all of those other hand-massagers.
5	1258934400	I have perpetual tension and terrible knots in my upper back area, shoulders, and neck.A few minutes a day using the back buddy brings a great deal of relief. I feel like the circulation is even improved to my head... I feel more alert after using it!I used to have a body-builder friend who would give me massages, and I'd tire out his hands and arms!!This works better than I could have imagined. If you can't afford good deep tissue massages and you have these types of tension issues, I highly recommend the back buddy.
4	1258243200	I recomend this self massger over some of the others available because of the extra knobs on the unit.  I am a former massage therapist and know the proper way and place to put pressure.  This does not come with any directions on how to use it, you just have to experiment with it and figure out what feels good.  It does get to spots you can't get to on your own normaly if you don't have some one to massage your back for you.  It also feels really good on the feet.  There are two kind of knobs on this one is round and one has a sharper point to get more intense pressure.  I gave it a 4 and not a 5 stars because it doesn't come with any directions.  A video would be even better.
5	1256688000	Received the thera cane in the time it was promised and it is in great condition.
5	1255996800	I could not decide which device to buy, so I ordered both.  I love both! Within 5 minutes of opening the package (sturdy packaging from DBROTH) I was massaging a tight muscle in my back that I had not been able to reach before.  I am 62 and have had over 40 years of back aches. I have tried stretching, yoga, the tennis ball in the tube sock thing, a hugger mugger roller, and every over the counter pain pill ever invented.  Last night I took a hot soak in the tub and then 30 minutes of theracane and back buddy.  This morning I woke up and my back was not aching.  I don't remember the last time that happened. These items came with the booklet from Theracane that showed massage positions.  You can download the manual from the Body Back Buddy web site. I also ordered the trigger point workbooks.  I will read them some day when I put the canes down.(approximate) Theracane Dimensions:height: 24 inches;diameter across cane head: 11 inches;handle length from cane to bulb: 3.5 inches;diameter of round bulbs: 1 inch;length of little knobby things: 1 inch;(approximate) Back Buddy Dimensions:height: 27 inches;diameter across larger cane head: 11 inches;diameter across smaller cane head:  9 inches;handle length from cane to bulb:  4 inches;diameter of round bulbs: 1 inch;length of pointy bulbs: 1.5 inches;length of little knobby things: 1 inch;Go ahead and laugh at me!  I don't care!  My back is happy!
5	1255132800	A friend of mine turned me onto these.  Saw it in his house and thought it was some kind of torture device.  Once he explained how it worked though, and I was able to use it, I was sold.I workout a lot and often have stiffness in my back.  I get massages on a regular basis, but sometimes I need something NOW!  Got one of these things and it helps me out considerably.  For me, not as good as a professional, but it keeps me pain-free (more or less) until I can get on the table of my therapist.The one downside to this product is the size.  It's not portable, so if you want one for more than a single location, you'll probably need to buy more than one.  I need one for my office, which is what lead me to look here.  This is a good price, by the way.
5	1253923200	The Body Back Buddy is great for getting to those spots that you cannot reach comfortably. I will probably purchase a book on trigger point therapy soon to get even more benefits from it.
5	1252368000	I love this self-massage tool! It has many knobs, allowing you to manipulate to all body parts needing massage. You get to control the depth of the massage by using the convenient handles. I was amazed at how well it really worked for relaxing those tense/tight muscles. I have Fibromyalgia and I am accustomed to aching muscles in my back and ribs. This tool allows me to get deep into the aches and release the toxins. My only regret is that I didn't buy two of them so I would have one to use at work. The price was reasonable for the quality and the use.
5	1252108800	A friend of mine had one of these things 10 years ago, so when I started having muscular tension and aches in my back, I knew what I needed. The Body Back Buddy has eliminated the need for medicinal pain relievers and even helped me to breath better!
5	1252022400	I'm sitting here reading the bad reviews with this fantastic tool on my neck as I am writing this, and had to make a comment ... I have constant neck pain from a past football injury. I have tried everything from doctors, medication, and saunas ... this is the ONLY thing tnat has ever helped me! ... I am sorry I did not invent it because it is really something that works ... if you have pain in your back or neck ... get this ... and don't listen to the idiot's who say it doesn't work, clearly their pain is not really bad ... because it has helped me more than anything else ... best part ... drug free!
5	1251590400	I have been having some pain in my upper back / near my shoulders from sitting at the desk typing and using the mouse at my job.  This cane helps some!It's not a miracle device that made all my pain go away, but it certainly helps and has made it feel better.  At least I know when it gets really bad, and I don't have someone around, that I can use the cane to help relax the muscles in my back and make it feel better.Looks a little strange... and when I received it at my work's shipping address, I got some funny comments about its appearance from my co-workers.  lol....Anyway, I recommend it!  Will it cure all pains?  No.  Will it help?  Yes!
5	1251590400	I know this thing looks crazy, but it's amazing for relaxing tight muscles that not even a massage from another person can get out.  I suffer from a lot of tension, and my physical therapist recommended this to me and lent me hers to try until I decided to buy my own.  It looked like a torture device to me when she first pulled out it, but now it's pretty much my best friend.  The S shape is great, because if you are un-tensing a muscle in your shoulder, you can hook your leg onto the end and use that to pull down rather than using your other arm to pull it.
5	1251158400	I had a knot under my shoulder blade that would keep coming back.  My wife couldn't seem to push hard enough to get it all the way out.  Using this I was able to get it all the way out.  Now I use it to take care of it before it gets large and painful.
5	1250899200	I wished I had bought it sooner.  It might seem expensive for a piece of plastic, but it can really get the knots in my back.  I use it on my feet my arms.  If you have muscle pain and like massages you will like this.
4	1250208000	This item was supposed to include a manual which was not shipped and the company made no mention of missing manual.  Contacted them asking for the manual.  Turns out they ran out of manuals and offered $6 back for missing manual.  I didn't like the fact that they just ommitted the manual hoping that I wouldn't notice it.  To me that's poor service.On a positive note, it is the best back massaging tool (non-electric) I have ever used and is far better than theracane imho.  I own both and this one gives a lot more leverage and have more versatility than theracane.  Only advantage of theracane is that is is easier to pack away in a tote to take on a trip.  I would give this product even 6 stars if it weren't for their lousy service.  I ordered 3 more sets of this w/ accumassage.  Had to pay $20 for shipping and they estimated 3-5 days shipping.  6 business days have passed (10 days total) and nothing yet.  The tool delivers, but the company doesn't.
4	1249430400	This can really find those trigger points and since YOU are in control, you can give each spot as much attention as it needs.  I think an improvement would be to have an area with two larger extrusions close together that could allow you to really stretch your neck out, where you could pull more into your spine without digging in too much so as to put your neck in traction and help restore the natural S-curve of the spine.  But still, i highly recommend this.  My chiropactor charges $30 for one visit and this will no doubt save more than a few trips and keep small problems from getting bigger.
5	1249084800	This morning I woke up with a muscle spasm in my right shoulder from sleeping in a strange position.  It was very difficult to move my head to the right and I knew exactly what I needed.  I felt the trigger point and knew that it needed to be massaged and have pressure applied.  I grabbed my BackBuddy like I have so many times before and went right for the spot.The Backbuddy is an amazing invention that will allow you to hit points from your feet to your neck.  It's a very clever tool and along with a book on trigger points like this one (which I bought):The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Editionyou have an entire method to self-treat during those times when you can't make it to a massage therapist or chiropractor.I am not a doctor or medical specialist, but I have used this method on myself (I have MS) and have found adequate relief at times.  I keep my back buddy handy and was certainly glad I had it this morning.  It's the type of thing that you probably won't need everyday ... but when you DO need it, it is WONDERFUL to have.I highly recommend it.
5	1247961600	A friend of mine, who is a message therapist, suggested this item to me. I'm an active person (workouts, kayaking, orienteering, camping, working on the house, etc) and as such, I am constantly getting tight muscles and trigger points.  The "rolling around on a tennnis ball on the floor" method was not getting the job done. The Body Back Buddy works beautifully for your back, neck, glutes, hamstrings, anywhere that you need to loosen up muscles and work trigger points to get rid of the pain and/or discomfort.
5	1247097600	Body Back Buddy provides just the relief that I expected when I ordered it.  It reaches places that I couldn't otherwise get to and I can provide just the right amount of pressure to relieve the spasm or knot.
5	1246665600	I love this for myself and also gave one to my mother as a gift and she is also pleased. Versatile and wonderful when you can't get someone else to give you a massage.  You can print out an instructional guide from the internet.
4	1242691200	The cane is great for getting at places you can't on your own and for applying pressure without wearing out your hands in the process.  However, you really have to experiment with the device to figure out how to use it best.  With all the curves and knobs, for me it took some time.  The little booklet that is provided with purchase is just a few pages.You can also easily apply too much pressure, but that too comes with practice.  A useful device, a bit overpriced, but effective with practice.
3	1242259200	I purchased this product specifically to target the area between my shoulder blades. Although it reaches this spot, there are a few issues. First, "the device", as it is called in my household, shipped without any instructions of any kind. Nothing. You can, however, BUY books that tell you how to use it... completely unacceptable in my book. I contemplated giving it one star just for this. Second, because you need at least one hand to manipulate, it's harder to reach my trouble area than it is for, say, a tennis ball. Finally, it's hard plastic and not as comfortable as a tennis ball.I gave "the device" three stars since it basically does what it's supposed to, just not up to my expectations. My advice... buy some tennis balls or base balls.
2	1240531200	This product does not come with a manual or explaintion on how to use the different knobs. It is difficult to understand how to use all the nodes to get relief. So far the product has caused me more pain than relief.
4	1240185600	I have killer chronic back pain because of a car accident years ago and a bulging disc. I can't get to a massage therapist as often as I need to, so having a way to hit pressure points on my own back is really nice. The little knobbies that are supposed to do your neck don't really work for me, but for getting under my shoulder blades and even running up and down the sides of my spine, the pointy end really works. It has more bumps than I use, but once I got used to how it works, it really works.
4	1239926400	This is a cool self massaging tool that will help you get to areas on your body that you usally cannot reach. The shape of the pressure point bulbs will help open up the muscle fibres. It hurts a little at first, but soon feels better. Some of the protuberances may be of special interest to women ;-p
4	1236729600	First this is made of like re enforced fiberglass injected plastic so there is no way you can break it because I tried.. I also have the regular Theracane and while I love it, the back buddy is just designed to do so much more and the little knobs are in just the right places for me and I am 5:09.  It is larger the theracane but its not huge as some have said but it is longer. By about five inchesUpdate::5/7/2014 still going strong mi have this one and two thracanes. I keep one in each vehicle MIT always seems like I am hit with a muscle not when driving and it takes the pain away.
4	1236297600	So I bought this as I have a tweaked neck from too much Basketball.  I was massaging my own neck where it hurt but this made things worse.  I realized one day how tight the muscles around my shoulder blade have gotten.  My wife tried but too delicate and although I realized these pressure points and muscles where the ones responsible for my neck pain she just couldn't get enough pressure on them.  This Back Buddy is great and I've used it for 3 days now and already my neck and back feel better, more loose, etc...I'd like to mention this is more like giving yourself a deep tissue massage.  It's not the gentle rubbing that some people prefer.  The plastic contact points are rather small (end of your thumb) and although there are some bigger ones this tool seems to lean towards the firm touch massage.  I guess if they had some larger points of contact I would like to try that too (4 stars for this instead of 5) but this is exactly what I needed for rock solid, knotted muscles.  Also it's very easy to use and apply more than enough pressure if needed.  You can easily work on your back, shoulder blades, etc... for a solid hour without tiring as it's leverage and design works that well.  Be cautious not to overdue it the first few days though.  I found it works best with shirt off and some massage oil or lotion.  Through the clothes works but you can't slide it around as well so this requires a bit more effort.I highly recommend this for those wanting a firm massage !  Also shipping was fast and this thing is super durable.  I'm loving it!
5	1231286400	I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He was the one who told me this is what he wanted. He loves it! He is very happy with this.
5	1230163200	A bit peculiar looking, but perfect for what it is. The wife's got one certain spot near the shoulder that needs so much digging when she's hurting that my hands cramp up!  This hits the spot absolutely perfectly!
5	1230076800	Love the massage cane.  Having periodic back issues that are relieved by applying targeted pressure to specific muscles/points, this is the perfect tool.  It also allows me not to wear-out my welcome with any reliable folks who are willing to give me massages when needed. Together makes for a healthier, pain free (relieved) back.
5	1229126400	Here is my story: I suffered from excruciating migraines all my life. I visited physical therapists, chiropractors as well as regular doctors. I saw all the good reviews for this product. I knew from what I was told by doctors that daily massage would be very helpful to relieve the pain I was experiencing. Well, I could not afford that kind of care. So in desperation, I ordered this product. Right away, I was able to massage away a 'real killer' by using this cane at the back of my neck and on the shoulder blades. Please consider purchasing this item if you suffer from migraines. It's a medication-free way to find relief.
5	1228780800	I've bought the cane 2 months ago and I consider it the best product I ever had for my back pain. It's inexpensive and very effective not only for low back pain. I am using it after sitting long hours in front of computer or after "bad" night sleep. It took only 5 or 10 minutes a day and pain that I had more than 2 years gone. Amazing tool!
5	1227571200	So I've owned this for less than one week. I have had neck, shoulder and lower back pain for quite some time. I have been in some kind of constant 24/7 pain in my lower back for the past year and a half,  Chiropractic doesn't help. My shoulders and neck have been extremely stiff and painful for the past 6-7 months. I had an episode of vertigo in July due to it.I was getting ready to have my doctor get me back into physical therapy where they have done TPT (trigger point therapy) on me before with great results.  Then I bought this.I know this is going to sound over the top, or maybe that I am exagerating, but I'm not.  Working my trigger points several times a day I have all but eliminated the tightness and stiffness in my neck and my lower back pain is almost non-existent.  But, you have to keep it up, not over do it, and do it consistently. That being said, two days after I received this, I went out and bought Clair Davies book, The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook. I recommend this because it helps to know what you are looking for and how to address it.  There is A LOT to learn, and I figure if I am going to poke and prod around on myself then I want to have a good idea on what I should do and how I should do it.  Being to physical therapy before I learned from them, too, and already had an idea of what I was looking for with trigger points.  In general though, remember for TPT to work, the trigger point is generally located away from the site of where you are experiencing pain, and also located on the same side of the body.Muscle wise, this is the best I have felt in a long time (and in such a short period of time) and I would recommend this tool. I would also recommend Clair Davies workbook (or any good TPT book) to go with it as a must have. Learn as much as you can so you can use it successfully.
5	1227312000	This cane is perfect for taking care of the painful knots in unreachable places and to save your hands from strain.  It enables you to massage the tender spots all over without creating more tension.
1	1226793600	Sorry gang, this is a cheap piece of plastic that is very hard to align over the sore spot and hurts like the dickens when you do. Save yourself the money and slam your back into a door knob. The knob is bigger and would hurt less.CONS:Hard to use - It takes a lot of fumbling to find the sore spot. Think about it, you can't see the sore spot, so you have to find it using this big, awkward device. It's actually harder than you think it is because this thing is curved and huge.Hurts - The same problem with finding the sore spot shows up when trying to press on the sore spot. It's really hard to control how hard you press on the store spot with this huge, clumsy thing. It's far too easy to dig in and really hurt yourself. Instead of hard plastic they should cushion the knobs so it isn't so painful. And even when you press right, it slips off the sore spot and you have to find it again.Cheap plastic - It's made of the same kind of toy plastic you find in dollar stores. Not sure why it costs so much.Design - Some of the reviewers talk about using this in the office. Not my office. The jokes kept coming in my office, and no one could use it with a straight face. It's hard to believe that anyone wouldn't be embarrassed bringing this thing into, much less actually using it in the office.PROS:Amazon has an excellent return policy.Worth a few laughs in the office.
5	1225238400	I am so glad I bought this. I constantly have sore shoulders and a tight neck....this massage tool works great. It is amazing how much pressure you can apply without hardly any force at all. I really love it.
5	1222992000	Awesome product! I never knew I would enjoy this so much! i had it shipped to work, and everyone was curious.  I let them try it, and now everyone wants one.  I love it and I recommend to everyone.
5	1222732800	This is a great product. I recommend it to anyone with back or neck problems or who gets headaches.
5	1222128000	The Back Buddy is my new best friend.  Spending my day in front of a computer and reading lengthy documents I experience a lot of tightness in my neck and upper back.  The Back Budy has been the cure!  I love it so much I bought a second so I could have one at home and one at the office.  Perfect for performing your own trigger point therapy.  Highly recommend this for anyone with back, neck or shoulder pain due to tight, knotted muscles.
5	1221350400	For a do-it-yourself job, this instrument does a fine job.  It greatly helps to relieve sore pressure points and tight spots.  There are limitations when working on myself -- I'm using my own muscles to operate this tool, so I can't relax the same as if I was having a massage or physical therapist work on me.  So after considering the limitations of a self-applied tension reducer, this works fine.  I have one at home and another one at my office -- I use one or both of them almost daily.
2	1219968000	The problem for me with the cane is that I have fibromyalgia/myofascial pain syndrome and when I use my muscles they tighten up and stay that way. It hurts and restricts my movement. So, when I use the cane I am holding it and applying pressure to the knots in another part of my body, all the time working the arm, shoulder and neck muscles, causing more problems in THOSE muscles. If you are normal, I think the cane would be great. I prefer the Knobble or just a rubber ball.
1	1219449600	I can't even begin to tell you how useless this product is.  It feel like it was made by a child.  It doesn't release tension but rather only causes it.  I have read the "manual" which is actually a 4 page book with crappy pictures and I have also read different methods on the internet.  In the end, I wish I had never purchased this trash.  It pretty much hangs as a prop in my closet.
5	1218844800	Looks kind of funny, but there is a crazy amount of uses for this. Reaches anywhere!Takes some time to get use to and find the right knob.I found the best place to use it is in bed. This way, all your mussels are relaxed.I personally have to go to massage therapy every week to keep my back from pain. With this tool, I am able to get into places the therapist would normally work on. I get pain relief within minutes!I would recommend this to anyone who has chronic mussel pain.
5	1218326400	I was so glad to find this product! Now I can do what the therapist did at home or if I can't get into the office. Takes a little getting used to, but once you do it is great! Comes with a good little booklet on how and where to use it.
5	1215820800	Great service and this is a great product. Looked at the Thera canebut  felt the Body Back Buddy Massage Cane would have more uses and beeasier to use. This proved to be true and I was pleasantly surprisedat it's studiness and strength.I have recommended it to friends and family. This really helps torelieve those tight spots and release tension in hard to pressurepoint places.
5	1215475200	I cannot compare this to the TheraCane which I have never used but both the Body Back Buddy I gave as a gift and the one I first tried out at home seems to have pleased everyone who has used it - and it was not a flash in the pan but continues weeks after arrival to be used. It not only is a great help for reaching points in one's back and neck or in places in front of the torso where it can give good leverage compared to when one attempts to use their hands on themselves, but it also is very convenient for trigger points on the legs, including difficult  ones on the sides of the thighs (where one can 'hook' it over the other leg using one of the little perpendicular 'handles' and by slightly spreading one's legs apart generate a surprisingly effective amount of pressure).The only question I have is how it would work for someone who was much larger than average (especially in terms of thickness).  While I can imagine it as still very useful for certain trigger points anyway, I wonder if it might be difficult to use it as conveniently for a really big person (like some big football linemen, say, or heavy weight powerlifters, or even someone built a bit that way).  If someone is that size and wonders about it, it might be good to try one out first before ordering one to see if it works for the points they had hoped to reach with it.
5	1213747200	This product is awesome! No need to convince someone to give you a back massage - the Body Back Buddy Massage Cane reaches all the places you can't. And you control the pressure. It is a great product for little money.
5	1212537600	This cane works wonders. My back is perpetually stiff and this cane allows me to loosen up knots on my own. Everyone should have one!
4	1212192000	This funny looking device has been a blessing for me. No more leaning on door jams or begging family members for a shoulder rub. This thing is great after hours on the PC or sewing machine. Works well for the upper/lower back, shoulders, neck and even the soles of your feet. It comes with a helpful card showing different positions to get those troublesome spots. Of course the Back Buddy won't replace a Licensed Therapist, however I highly recommend this for in between therapy/massage visits.
5	1212019200	Because the slightly longer hook, you have improve leverage and hook like points that can dig deeper.  The downside is the storage and it's not as portable to carry around compare to the original Therma Cane.
5	1211241600	This is an excellent product for reaching any area of the body. you can use it standing up, sitting, laying down, etc. its not quite as huge as it looks in the photos. It has more massage points on it then the theracane. I would recommend you purchase one of the trigger point books along with this device.
5	1210550400	I have owned the Body Back Buddy (formerly the Better Back Buddy) for at least 8 years, if not longer.  I use it daily at home to help control my fibromyalgia muscle pain.  I bought a new one for my office, where many of us use it to relieve our neck, shoulder and back muscle tension.This is the best self-help tool I have ever owned, and I highly recommend it to anyone who experiences body pain.
5	1210291200	I use the back buddy regularly and even take it with me when I travel.  I have had neck and shoulder problems for years and this allows me to work out knots and give me much needed relief between massages.  I would highly recommend this item, anyone can use it.
5	1208649600	Because my husband isn't always available to rub my back when I REALLY need it, this Back Buddy has be perfect! When I'm at the computer, I rest it over my shoulder and every once in a while press on a sore spot for a while, go on with my work but can keep using it all day long!
4	1207785600	I bought this for my fibro tender points.  It does work well, however it could be better.  Not bad for the price though.  Be careful not to overuse because you will be sore!
5	1207440000	Hello world...I have to say the Body Back Buddy looks funky, and trust me, really does work.My wife and I love and use it everyday. While you could simulate it's effects with all manner of this or that,having fifteen varying sized and shaped points in one gadget is crazy awesome! You can get to some very hard to reach areas very easily due to it's "cane" design. Possibly the best 28$ I've spent in a long, long time.Buy and USE it, your back and body deserve this level of attention.
5	1207094400	Great Tool, so many ways you can apply pressure, massage muscles, just unlimited uses and easy to hold on to...would highly recommend this tool!
3	1207008000	It seems pretty good thus far, it can really get some knots but not others.I was so shocked to see it was shipped unwrapped/padded in a huge manilla envelope! yes a paper envelope! It was mostly out of the package when it came to my house- I was annoyed that it was scratched and dragged along who knows where!The 2nd disappointment is that it is plastic- seems fairly strong, but I expected better quality.
5	1206921600	First off, I usually have tightness in my shoulders and neck (probably from spending too much time in front of a computer all day at work).  I also have stiffness in my lower back from time to time.  The BBB is really effective at reaching all my knots and bringing relief through hitting those pressure points (on the neck, upper and lower shoulder blade, and all along the spine).  What makes it so good is that when you position the "ball points" on those areas, the tool is designed so that you can use just modest leverage to get to the deep tissue.  This is key because you can use this for quite a while and not get tired.  I can't stress the importance of this enough.  I find that with proper positioning, I can really get a lot of pressure by simply using my arm weight with modest effort.Also, I find that with some practice you can actually slide the ball points along your tight areas, which more effectively mimics a real massage vs. just getting point pressure (which I find brings less relief).  For instance, by gently laying on top of the bbb (facing up), I can get a very deep lower back massage - and all by myself!The bbb is also very sturdy.  Takes a little bit of experimentation to get used to it, but all in all, it's one of my favorite self-massage tools and I would highly recommend it.
5	1205798400	I told my brother that he'd be getting a really weird birthday present from me, but that it would  be his favorite. He wasn't too sure about it at first, but a few weeks later he confirmed my prophesy. He loves it. (Bonus, it's a great ice breaker at gatherings; everyone wants to try it!)
5	1205452800	Tool works great for those trigger points.  A wedge on one end lets you get in behind the shoulder blades.
5	1204243200	Body Back Buddy Classic is amazing!!! I have tried them all!  This is way better than any electronic massager you can buy.
5	1203724800	Very good product.  Great at getting under the shoulder blades, which is where my back typically hurts.  Also good for the base of the skull and transition to my neck.  I wish I knew that it came in sizes when I ordered.  This one works but the larger model would be easier to get around my shoulders since I'm a big guy.
5	1202860800	This is an awesome tool! I have to rely on myself when my muscles in my back and neck hurt and this is tool is great! Makes it easy to massage all parts of the body with out a massage therapist. The only down side is the small booklet that comes with it is very basic and only has pictures to show you. This booklet needs to be more informative but other than that this is the best tool for self massage and trigger point pressure work. I did find that to make it easier and smoother I put a little massage oil or cream on the end that I am using for the back, keeps the friction down and it doesn't feel like your tearing the skin.
4	1202688000	this works really well at getting at those pressure points...especiallyin the traps area.  i just wish there were more detailed usage pictureson the different ways to use each point or nub.  otherwise...great productand more versatile than the theracane i used in OT.
5	1200873600	UPDATE: I still like this thing, but if I could go back in time I think I'd get the kind that's not double-sided like this one. (Like, cut off 2/3rds of the way down.) The reason being that with that shorter one you could hang it over the arm of your couch and it would stay out of the way but would always be handy. This one is so big and awkward that there's no good place for me to keep it. It's still an excellent product, but if I had the other one (like a friend of mine has) then I would use it more often because I would be able to keep it in a handier location.-------This thing is JUST what I needed. I also bought three other products, the "AccuMassage Self Massage Tool", the "Back Roller", and the "Davinci Tool" (All sold through Amazon by BodyBackBuddy). So far, this one is by FAR the best--at least for what I need. It allows me to dig into the sore spots under my shoulder blades and work on them as if I could step outside my body and massage my own back.The other three tools that I mentioned above aren't that great, at least not so far. I was especially disappointed in the AccuMassage. It looked like it would be great for doing my neck, but doesn't actually squeeze mine the way I'm needing.
5	1199836800	Great for self massage through releasing trigger points. These had been recommended to us in massage therapy school to keep ourselves healthy. I love it!!
5	1199664000	I purchased this product back in October, after using a friends at work. It is so awesome! I had to have one after using my friends. I accidently ordered the wrong type, so I exchanged it for the blue newest model that is in the picture. It is slightly different than my freinds. Anyway they have the best customer service! I called and emailed them when I realized I had ordered the wrong one. They responded very quickly to my phone call and email! I was extremely impressed! They sent the correct massage cane to me quickly. Most of all I love this product and everyone at my job and in my family wants it after they try it! Excellent customer service!!!! I will buy more from this company for sure!
4	1196553600	I have used it daily for a few weeks now following the advice on the book "The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Edition" by Clair Davies (Author), Amber Davies (Author), David G. Simons (Foreword. And it definitely works.  The book mentions the Thera Cane, and although I haven't used it, the extra curve in the BodyBackBuddy provides with two different kind of knobs (one round, one pointy) to provide different level of muscle penetration, also it allows ingenious ways to find leverage to apply pressure without tiring the hands.I would rate it excellent but I had to use sandpaper to finish the product as it had some rough edges on the knobs.
5	1195603200	That was my question to friends who have this crazy-looking self-massage tool.  After 10 minutes, I was "hooked". The best thing is that you can relax--as one should when trying to reduce pain--and even laugh while you tie yourself in a pretzel exploring the impact of each knob on each pain spot.  And it's incredibly versatile.  Neck pain?  Got it!  Cramp in the arch of your foot?  Fixed.  Muscle knot that you can't reach yourself?  No worries.  Besides, even if it doesn't work, what a great conversation starter on a cold rainy night in the Pacific Northwest: "Top 10 ways to use the Buddy Massage Cane that aren't found in the directions."
5	1192665600	I ordered this to help release trigger points on my muscles to relieve fybromyalgia symptoms. It works wonderfully, and there is no place I cannot reach with one knob or another. The two ends of the "S" are different. One is a ball, the other shaped more like an elbow. The two perpendicular pieces are the same way. This tool will allow me to hit any trigger point I want to with as much depth or pressure as I need. Until I am rich enough to afford my own massage therapist, this is the next best thing.
5	1191283200	Great gizmo for getting to the little knotted areas in your neck and back. I keep one at home and one in the office.
5	1190678400	I am pleased with this product!  It works great.  Do yourself a favor and don't purchase it from this seller (Excercise Goods).  I paid $7.95 for shipping, it took 14 days for delivery, and the seller tried to bribe me into removing my negative feedback!!  Not good customer service at all.
5	1190592000	I've had major back and neck problems since an auto accident a number of years ago. The pain often becomes an unbearable burning sensation that I am not able to reach.  I have often thought..."If I only had a nail on the wall that I could press into..."  Wish I had invented the Back Buddy!  Since my purchase of this remarkable product, I can use it to find the exact point of pain, use as much pressure as necessary to relieve the spasm and get greatful relief.  Thank you Back Buddy!!
5	1188691200	This is an absolutely great tool for massaging one's own "trigger points" or knotted muscles.The "thera-cane" is recommended by many trigger point practitioners, and this is even better in my opinion. It has more options and you can reach virtually any point of your body with this thing and dig into your muscles to help release the trigger points that cause pain.This thing works, and it's great. Especially if you already know where your trigger points are. If not, I recommend the book by Clair Davies, sold here, the title is something like The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook.Anyway, this is a great tool. Overpriced, but you really can't get anything like this anywhere else for cheaper, so.... go for it!
5	1186790400	This product is amazing!  There is not a spot on my back that I can't reach to massage.
3	1185148800	I had high hopes that the back buddy would allow me to reduce the visits I made to receive deep tissue massage for my chronically tense neck and upper back muscles. Although the back buddy is well made and does provide pressure at trigger points, I haven't found it as effective as either rolling around the floor with a tennis ball under my back, or using a foam roller (very fun and effective). Probably would not have purchased it had I known this in advance. I gave it three stars though b/c it does what it claims (provides pressure on trigger points) and is well made.
5	1184544000	This is the weirdess thing I have ever seen.  It does work.  I get pain in middle of my bad from working.  I also have fibromyliga.  I can put pressure on points as hard or soft to get releif.
5	1184371200	this self massager works great. it's solid and has many spots to grab on to for adjustment/placement of the massage points. great for back muscles!
5	1184198400	I love this product!! I have "tension knots" in my back and this has improved them 99.9%!! My Grandmother also has back problems and used my back buddy and she said she slept like she hasn't slept in years! I gave her mine and just ordered another one! I've had a hard time getting through the past week without it!! I would recommend this to anyone who has pain in the back, neck, shoulders, etc.
5	1181347200	If you're an athlete looking to relieve muscle soreness in your back the Body Back Buddy will do it. I've used mine for a couple of years now and it works wonders. At two feet in length and twenty inches in width, this blue S-shaped  device is an effective self-massage tool.
5	1180828800	After 10 years of considering back pain to be a constant in my life, a chiropractor virtually ended my back pain using trigger point therapy.  I hadn't realized how much life I was giving up due to back pain until the pain was gone.  Unfortunately, when my back pain came back years later, I found that my new chiropractor did not practice trigger point therapy and the methods he did practice brought only partial relief.  It was at this point that I started looking for another answer.  The Body Back Buddy Classic has been that answer.  Now whenever I get tense, painful knots in my back, I am able to message them out myself with the Body Back Buddy Classic.  I find this device to save me much time, money and pain.
4	1180656000	This is something you can use without the help of another and it is effective too.  The knobs are nice for digging into those tight shoulder muscles.
5	1179100800	This tool is amazing.  I have chronic knots under my shoulder blades in my back, and this nifty gadget works them out easily without much effort on my part.  My mom has now semi-confiscated it for her own use (ok, more like borrowed).  I just might have to purchase another one for myself soon!
5	1178928000	My Physical Therapist told me about this device, and it lives up to her assurances.  You can take care of a great many sore, problem areas by yourself--very comfortable and easy to use.
5	1178668800	Thera cane works as well as I would have hoped. Easy to use and handle. Stores away in closet or coat rack. It has helped me massage muscles that are tight, due to recent cervical spine surgery, that I am unable to reach with restricted range of motion.
5	1176336000	This is the wierdest looking thing to explain to someone who first sees it.  It looks like it might be a sex toy.  For massaging your own back it works great.  It seemed expensive before I ordered it, but it is very sturdy and the price seems more reasonable now that I have it.
5	1176336000	I bought this for my wife to address my wife's back aches.  She uses this frequently and it helps.This should not be viewed as a complete back massager (electric units do better if you have some one to run it), but you should view it as a sort of "first aid" tool. When you have a muscle group that is paining you and you need immediate attention, this device will help rub out the pain.
5	1176163200	My husband has knots in hard to reach places on his back and this product can get everyone! It was worth every penny!
5	1175731200	It will only take 2 words to sum up this product:  LOVE it!  My massage therapist recommended it and I bought it the same day.  I only wish I would have heard about it sooner ;)
5	1171065600	The back buddy is a great invention, you can really get to to those hard to reach spots with as much pressure as you want by yourself. While it won't beat a good massage... there's no waiting! A smart buy
5	1170633600	I can get to the tight knots behind my own shoulder blades, as hard as I need. I love my new tool.
5	1169078400	I can't live without my Buddy! I can fix the pinched muscle under my shoulder blade now.
5	1162771200	There is only one thing that I wish this tool would be and that is more travel friendly.  It is a bit odd shaped and difficult to fit into a small to medium-sized gym bag and back pack.  Otherwise I'd take it with me everywhere. It is very effective at getting rid of all the aches and pains developed after sleeping in a bad position, working long hours, sitting at a computer for too long, traveling, and over-exertion.  I must have saved several hundred dollars in massage therapy and pain killer medication costs in the past year and a half that I've owned this.
5	1140652800	This tool is great!  I'm a dad with 3 kids and giving piggy back rides is part of my daily routine...highly recommended for all dads!  My back pays for it though and everybody runs for the hills when they hear me asking for a back rub...sometimes I even have to bribe them...wife too!  With the Body Back Buddy, I can treat my back to some much needed relief and hit the exact hard-to-reach areas!
