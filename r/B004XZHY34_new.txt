4	1405036800	sometimes does not connect
2	1404950400	good features but had &#34;walkie talkie&#34; effect during calls, not true two way conversations.
2	1404950400	This is the worst bluetooth speaker phone ive had, i hope it's a malfunctioned unit, keeps disconnecting sporadically. fm transmitter is just a gimmick that doesnt work, and the audio is, well, bad.
1	1404950400	This did not work at all in my Hyundai Entourage.  I was able to return it for a full refund.
5	1404950400	Works flawlessly. I own one and will be getting a couple more for the rest of my vehicles.
5	1404950400	Sounds great and voice is clear
5	1404864000	This device is everything advertised.  Sound quality is exceptional and it is easy to use.  I especially love the voice commands. It is the perfect companion for a commuter in an older vehicle which is not equipped with all the latest built-in sound gadgetry.
5	1404777600	Nice hand free smart voice control Bluetooth for car operations.
4	1404777600	Does what the descriptions say it will do. Connectivity is quick and simple. Works seamlessly. Jabra telephone support is also excellent, should you need to use them. The only downside I've noticed so far is the quality of music streaming through FM, which is does not appear as great as lauded.
4	1404691200	Love it
5	1404604800	Excellent product. Pairs right up with a iPhone 5S and provides good sound in a moving car. Allows you to access your phone book and other areas of the iPhone with Siri.I wish they didn't even offer the optional ability to text, etc. We don't need people doing that on our roads, even with their voice.
3	1404604800	Shipping was quick, price was fair, just had a little troublesetting it up. Took our son and son in law to get it going.
5	1404604800	Amazing product. Exceeded my expectations.
3	1404604800	I've tried a couple different units in the past. I was impressed with the speaker sound  with music on this one.  The mic for hands free talking is OK (i had hoped for better). The FM transmitter seams a little weak.  Overall, I like the unit.
3	1404518400	Inconsistent automatic connection to our iPhone. Cannot really tell if its because the auto power does not work as described.  Cannot recommend due to this.
5	1404518400	Exceeded my expectations for hands-free phone calls from the car. Just enough sound out of the speakers for hearing the other person. About 98% of the people I've talked to have not had a complaint as far as being able to hear me.
5	1404432000	This works great for me, the speaker is clear and the caller is easy to hear
4	1404345600	The only complaint I have is it has a hard time playing music from amazon on my 5c. I have to set it all up, I just can't say play. Everything else is just great with it.
5	1404345600	Exactly what I was looking for. Works great!
5	1404345600	I love this product! Very useful!
3	1404259200	Linking was quick.  Turns on when I get near unit.  All good.  Voice quality and volume is iffy. Listeners frequently say that they cannot understand me.  Because it's Jabra I am disappointed.
5	1404172800	I bought this for my husband to use in his truck, which is a diesel so it has a lot of natural background noise.  It's fantastic!  It has great speakers, so he can hear everything clearly, and from the other end you can't tell that he's even in his truck when he's talking to you.  Highly recommend!
4	1404172800	Does what it says but I wish it did more. The sound on it is decent for a speaker, and the caller on the other end hears you loud and clear. Just wish it had more voice functionality. Oh and the most annoying thing is when it doesn't understand you say &#34;ANSWER&#34;
3	1404086400	Had trouble getting it to work. Obtained a second unit as the support could not help. After extensive checking and comparing with very first one (Jabra cruiser). Obtained new phone as recommended apple 5s. After 5 days of trying to get it to work I found setting wrong on both phones. No one could help me including Jabra and AT&T. Unit was going direcly to speaker on phone and not Jabra. I now have three Jabra's. Two Freedoms and one Cruiser both of which have been opened so cannot return. Using Freedom now. There is no place in the instruction's about iPhone settings. Had to show AT&T representative how to change it as even he could not figure out.  &#62;fredaferguson@comcast.net&#60;  &#62;fergusonelectricinc@comcast.net&#60;
4	1404086400	I really wanted to give this 5 stars, but there was just a couple little things that stopped me.First of all, I really love this speakerphone.  Jabra makes really good bluetooth products.  I also have the WAVE headset, and that thing is phenomenal.  I bought the FREEWAY speakerphone because I enjoy listening to Podcasts while on the road.  The headset worked fine for that, but I really didn't want the ear piece in for long periods of time (plus, there was a small problem with the ear piece not staying in place, but that's a different review).  The speakerphone with the FM Transmitter is the perfect solution.The design of the speakerphone is wonderful.  Some people might not like it's size, but I have no problem with it.  It clips on to the visor and is out of the way, let close enough to access the buttons if needed.  The buttons are also very responsive.  Since the buttons are actually part of the bezel, you don't have to pinpoint the exact location of a small button.  In other words, if you want to turn the volume down, you press anywhere in the bottom corner and it will respond.  There is no hunting for buttons.  The clip makes the unit very sturdy.  No shifting around at all.Phone conversations on this unit are fantastic.  I can hear the caller very clearly, and they can hear me.  I tried out the GOgroove X3 FM Transmitter, and callers could not hear me unless I raised my voice.  With this I can talk like normal and it comes through clean.Pairing the device could not be simpler.  I also love that it will go to sleep when I get out of the car and wake up when I come back.  There's really not a lot of reason to actually turn the power switch off.  The battery life is also amazing.Now the reasons why I withheld 1 star.  Listening to music and podcasts works fine, but not amazing.  The speaker gets loud, but not quite enough when driving on the highway.  To remedy this you can try out the FM Transmitter function.  The audio comes out much louder through the radio, but it's really tough to get a good static-free broadcast.  That being said, the FM Transmitter on this unit works better than the GOgroove X3, which is supposed to be better than speakerphones with FM Transmitters.  I found a station that works very well.  Even though it's not perfect (still a little bit of static), it's still better than the X3.  If you play music loud enough it will drown out the static, but podcasts can't get loud enough for that.  I find that between the speaker and the FM function, I always have a suitable option.  Either way, calls come through loud and clear without destroying your eardrums.The other thing that was sort of a minus (and this is well noted throughout the reviews) is that sometimes the unit won't recognize voice commands.  If you want to place a call to somebody on their mobile device, you have to say &#34;Call name, mobile&#34;.  That's pretty standard.  However, sometimes it won't pick up the part where you say &#34;mobile&#34;.  It will ask you Home or Mobile if you have multiple entries for that contact.  You say &#34;Mobile&#34; again and it might not hear it.  So, it's a little flaky with the voice commands, but not so bad that it's dialed the wrong number or completely dropped my command.  It might just take a repeat of the command.That's really it for flaws.  If this thing had just a little bit more strength for the FM Transmitter and be more responsive with the voice commands, it would easily get 5 stars.  Otherwise, the Jabra FREEWAY is an excellent choice for a bluetooth speakerphone.
4	1404086400	The unit seems to generally work, but I have been having so problems with it talking to a older phone. The voice relay seems to get a little lost or wrong. I can use voice commands to the phone and all works fine, but if I try to use the FreeWay, to make hands free calls, the phone does not know what to do. I think it must be a interface problem.
4	1404086400	Device easy to setup and works in my vehicle which is a large SUV. I have an Android phone which it sync quickly to after I let it charge for about 3 hours. The call volume is loud, my wife and I were able to talk to a caller from within my vehicle and she could her both of us loud and clear. The FM tuner on the other hand is useless from my point of view, all of the stations that I tried to tune it to was completely static and very low so I gave up on it after about 15 minutes of try to get it to work. Getting the voice dial commands to work took awhile, as other has stated it would start my music to play from my phone instead of opening my phone address book. I was able to successfully to make it work by speaking very loud and slowing.
1	1404000000	Speaker very goodMicrophone clarity not stable. Sometimes they hear me and most of the time caller doesn't hear clearly my voice.
5	1403913600	The speakerphone preforms exactly as expected.  It's easy to couple with our two phones.  The unit easily lasts 10-12 hours without charging. The FM transmitter is wonderful.  We travel cross country several times a year and listen to Audible books.  Listening to them over our radio (older car no bluetooth) is simple and has great quality.  There is a MINOR issue of finding an open frequency, but takes only a few seconds to resolve. Great product.  Great results.
5	1403913600	My husband loves this new and improved Jabra.
5	1403827200	I took the time to read as many reviews of this product as I could possibly absorb. I also ran comparisons between the Jabra and the Motorola Roadster which I found helpful for making my final decision. My ancient '98 Pathfinder came with an excellent Bose Sound System for which I have been extremely grateful. I was looking for a bluetooth device that could connect well through that system and I am elated to report that it does that quite well, thank you very much! The first few calls I made and received were a bit rough, but as time and frequency of use occurred the quality of the calls improved to a very good quality level. One person, in their review, provided a useful technique of attaching an extra usb cable to the Freeway and letting this wind around the rear view mirror (for those of us who have antennae in our windshields) to amplify the reception of the radio frequency. I have not tried this yet, but as I travel some distances where multipath can occur, I plan to implement this technique and am hopeful for success. In the same review that person pointed out that the Freeway did not always disconnect from their cell phone when exiting the car. Armed with that information I simply take a moment to turn off the device before I exit the car and turn it on as I prepare to drive.  I am highly satisfied with this product.
4	1403827200	Can sometimes be glitchy but for the most part I find it helpful when driving. I have a password protection on my Samsung S3 so I find that I have to punch in my password before I can make a hands free call. Wish it could bypass this as I don't like having to do that while driving but otherwise it works well.
5	1403740800	This speakerphone is perfect for cars who don't have it build it. It is easy to install and the quality of the sound is good , plus the other person can hear you very clear even if you're 1 meter away from it.For more secure driving and easier answering or calling consider buying this product : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FHX9OK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=9325&creativeASIN;=B007FHX9OK&linkCode;=as2&tag;=theworscooash-20&linkId;=S3K6FCM53STINQCPHope my review helped and happy driving!
1	1403740800	I can hear very clear, but went it time for me to speak, people can't hear me, also I have to talk to loud inside my car, I don't like this jabra freeway at all.
5	1403740800	I have used this on several trips so far and it has worked quite well.  I spoke with my son whose BMW has a built-in bluetooth system and he said that my voice came through loud and clear.  The voice commands are simple and easy to remember.  I have to admit that I haven't used the voice texting function, but I will probably not ever use it.  My job requires that I drive several hundred miles about twice a month, so this comes in handy during those trips.  I hope that it keeps working for a long time.  Battery life seems fine and the long charging cord makes it easy to be connected when needed.
5	1403654400	I was looking for a hands free device and wanted something without wires hanging all over. This is a nice neat package which clips onto the visor. I have mine on the sunroof panel. Simple to operate and the sound is clear. The unit turns off and on automatically tells you what it is doing. Battery lasts 14 hours of use. Auto turn on saves the battery so it is a very long 14 hours.. I charge maybe once a week and it charges quickly. I recommend this unit and would buy again.
4	1403568000	This is an excellent device. I spent a long time reading reviews (both critical and customer) for this and the other big competitor. At the end of the day, this device easily won out. I bought it as a gift to begin with, and the recipient loved it so much, they bought one for ME as gift a month later. I shared it with a few friends, and they bought one too. It's SO much nicer to use in the car than the bluetooth earpiece I've used for ages.  The only thing that doesn't really work well is the FM transmitter feature, but to be honest, I didn't expect that to really work well (it's never created clear audio with any electronics device in 20 years). But you don't need it, the speakers on this phone are great!One big tip: Make sure you update it with the firmware off Jabra's website. It fixes a lot of the voice recognition issues that happen right out of the box and makes for a much smoother experience.In short - this device is worth every penny!
4	1403568000	Bought this for my son for his older truck. Works great and gives me peace of mind that he's not holding the phone while driving.
5	1403481600	I like it. It works very well ;) :) finally I don't have to use my phone while I am driving
1	1403481600	If you're looking for a basic interface between your cellphone and your non-Bluetooth car stereo, this unit often functions well.  But look out!  You have to regularly shop around the FM band to find the magic un-used frequency (which, for unknown reasons, will not work every time, even within the same geographical area in which it worked the day before).  The bigger problem, though, is that the unit's internal speakers are junk.  They sound great out of the box, but they simply are not sufficient to last.  The speakers in my unit blew during a several hour-long drive in which I used the internal speaker function to make multiple phone calls.  I had turned up the volume pretty high to be able to hear all phone conversations, and the speakers just plain couldn't handle the load.  Now any sound coming out of those speakers, whether music or voice/phone calls, is significantly distorted from the blown speakers.  I've had the unit for 5 months.  The speakers started really being annoying with their distortion about a month ago.  I've tried the seller (the Amazon primary seller) to return them, and today received a courteous email saying the product was beyond the return window.  It's not the seller's fault: the unit just has junky speakers.  Why on earth would a company manufacture a device with such potential, only to use junk speakers in it that cannot handle the load from the unit itself?  Disappointing.  I may be stuck with this thing now.  It will still work as an interface between my phone and the car stereo... but that only works when you find the exactly perfect position inside the car for its transmitter to work/for the car stereo to receive it.  I've frequently had to drive with the visor (on which the unit was mounted/clipped) half way or all the way down in front of me as I drove, partly blocking my view.  I actually installed a piece of wire, wrapping one end around the antenna wire where it enters the back of my car stereo, and leaving the other end just sticking out of the console, acting as a second antenna for the FREEWAY to transmit to; it helped some.  I've read lots of reviews on this product, which stirred me to buy it originally.  Perhaps in certain cars, the reception isn't an issue.  And perhaps if you never turn it up above half volume, the internal speakers may never blow.  The unit looks great, and when it works, it works great.  I've never bothered to try using the voice-activated functions, having had enough work on my hands just positioning the unit each time... which makes it a less than hands-free proposition while you're tampering with its position to maximize its functioning.  Here's the killer: for maybe $40 more than what I paid for that thing, I've now seen that I can get some really nice Bluetooth-enabled car stereos.  That's my next step, now that my FREEWAY is all but useless.  That distortion just drives me nuts.  Of course, if you do go the 'new stereo' route, you've got to either install the new stereo or pay someone to install it.
3	1403481600	This is a great speakerphone- it has great voice clarity (on both ends) and is easy to operate.  Unfortunately, it's not entirely compatible with my LG Cosmos 3.  If it receives a call from a number in the contact list, it reboots the phone.  LG is supposed to produce a software fix for the problem, but hasn't yet.
4	1403395200	It really works.  Am still learning what all it can do.  Wish the instructions were better.  Do not miss any calls when traveling in the car.
4	1403222400	Let me start with some background:Used in a 2006 Honda PilotFirst Speakerphone personallyPaired with (2) iPhones 5sI am very pleased with the ease of use and the call quality of this speakerphone.  It is super simple to set up, offers a ton of functionallity but is also simple and easy to use.  I took over 1 star for a few reasons.  First, the FM transmitter is pretty much useless for me.  I don't feel this is an issue of the Jabra, but more with the lack of open FM stations.  No matter where I am at, I am not able to find a clean channel that is anywhere close to clear.  I have tried this with both phone calls and music streamed from my iPhone.  After a few days of trying to get it to work, I have just decided to give up and just use it as a Bluetooth Speakerphone.  the speakers are good and loud, so using the FM is really not needed in my opinion.The other comment I wanted to make is that I do not see the need for the free (for one year) and then paid subscription from Jabra.  With the iPhone 5s, you have to hit the &#34;Voice&#34; button and then say &#34;Phone Commands&#34;.  This will open Siri.  Once Siri is open, you can speak into the Jabra and ask it whatever you want.  For example, make a call, send a text, ask about weather, etc....  Whatever you ask would then be heard from the Jabra.  I dont see a need to pay $59 a year for this.
5	1403136000	Love, this is the second time I bought, feeling is very good, when I opened the car door is connected
4	1403136000	I like the system ,but wish had a more user friendly on and off switch, thank you. BWR  is that ok
5	1403049600	This product made my old vehicle into a perfect hands free, voice activated equivalent to the newer models with sink or other GM model systems. I love it and it works without a glitch. Great addition to a car I want to keep and modernised it for safety.
4	1403049600	Nice device.Only issue is voice reorganization. But that is fine with me. Otherwise very nice. Meet my expectation. Excellent.
1	1402963200	1, FM function is worse, when the sound is transferred to FM, noise in background is unbelievable.2, Mic is what I hated deeply, others can not hear me what I am saying, the sound is on and off, some times I need shout...can you imagine that?3, the voice recognition is the nightmare, whatever I say, it run in to the pair process, or just tell me say again, or tell me &#34;the command you can say ...&#34;I do not expect more, as a speakerphone, can you let others hear what I am saying?....
2	1402963200	You'd think they'd be better at noise reduction. Callers on the other side of the conversation have trouble hearing over it.
4	1402963200	Was initially frustrated with the device, but I downloaded the most current version of the software from the Jabra website and was able to get it to work properly.  The volume levels upon the device could be better.
5	1402963200	I ordered two Jabra FREEWAYs - one for my car and the other for my truck. It took only seconds to pair them with my Galaxy S5 and then I set up the FM in my truck. It's easy to find a clear channel then, using the volume up/down buttons, tune the Jabra to the radio. It really is that simple. While the in-built speakers are really good, the sound through the truck speakers is excellent. On a long journey, it is necessary to re-tune to a different clear channel as needed on FM but that is no problem.I use my smartphone data plan to listen to the radio through the TuneInRadio Google Play App. With over 20,000 radio stations there is always something to listen to and NO satellite radio bills. I tried satellite radio but was disappointed with the station choices. This solves that problem.So this is the best device I have bought in a long time. It solves so many problems in a very neat package. I am absolutely delighted with my purchase.
2	1402876800	I had high Expectations from this speaker but i'm sorry to say that the other end of the conversation does not hear me well at all.
5	1402876800	I bought this for my sister who drives an older car with a non-Bluetooth radio.  The unit works great, she uses it without sending the audio thru the car radio.  The unit sounds great, is plenty loud, and works just like the video of the product on the manufacturer's web site.  I have spoken to her several times when she was using it, and it sounded clear and loud.  The size of the unit isn't bad, it looks a little wide but it is very thin.  The width of the unit allows for 3 speakers, which gives it the great sound.  I may buy one for my 68 Chevy pickup because I have to leave the old stock radio installed.
5	1402790400	Excellent buy!  The sound quality is great. I can listen to I heart radio and XM app without any additional equipment!
5	1402704000	I heard about the Jabra from a coworker who raved about it. I bought it for my 22 year old son and he loves it!!! Thanks!
5	1402617600	I love this.  Works Wonderfully.  It connects every time I step into my car.  It is nice and crisp sound.  However make sure your windows are up when speaking.
5	1402617600	If you don't have Bluetooth in your car this is a great addition. Since my state went hands free I needed something in my car and did not want to wear an ear piece when I was driving.
5	1402531200	This purchase was the 3 Jabra I get, I've had mine for over a year and have gifted 2.  The Jabra Freeway leaves other speakerphones in the dust.  The sound quality is superb, it will get as loud as you like and then some.  Although I've played with the FM feature, I mostly use its built-in speakers, the sound is fantastic and there's no need to play through the car stereo.Huge fan of the motion sensor which turns the speakerphone off after you leave the car and back on when you get in the car - now the batteries last a long long time (with other speakerphones I had I would often forget to turn them off, and the battery would drain in a couple of days).  Charging is quick, and the speaker will give you plenty of warning when the battery gets low that you can continue using it and charge when you get home (although the included cigarette plug charger lets you charge on the road).If you're a Samsung Galaxy S4 owner, this speakerphone will work great with your phone, not just for phone calls but also for navigation, music, voice recognition (Google voice search), etc.
3	1402531200	It serves its basic purpose. Good noise cancellation and voice quality. Voice command leaves alot to be desired. Every command I give turns the music on in place of what I asked.
3	1402531200	We ordered 2 of these and 1 worked good and the other doesn't understand any of the commands. But It is still usable.
4	1402531200	Really easy to connect but in occasion it doesn't understand the commands...usually this happens when there is a lot of road noise.
4	1402531200	This thing works great. I bought it for my girlfriend since we like to talk when she's driving. Only problem is that its hard to understand sometimes when she's driving on the freeway.
2	1402444800	It's hard for people on the other line to hear me because the microphone pics up so much ambient noise. After about a minute, the audio quality improves. But the first minute of trying to talk on this thing is very frustrating. Besides that, all the features work very well as advertised.

5	1402444800	Everything it is described to be! Nice and loud. Truly hands free. Appreciate that it turns on automatically when I enter the vehicle. Battery life is amazing.
4	1402272000	Well,  I ordered one for my car and one for my wife's on one invoice.  They offer a free year of &#34;Voice Assist,&#34; but I've found it only works in my wife's car and not in mine.  I don't think they're able to distinguish that I ordered two and ought to have two separate accounts.  My emails have NOT gotten any satisfactory replies.  However, the one that works is great!And the one in my car (that doesn't work with Voice Assist) DOES pair with my ipod touch and plays my audiobooks.  For that, I'm grateful.
4	1402272000	Excellent volume, easy to operate, Just what I was looking for.  My only gig is sometimes the voice recognition is lacking.
4	1402185600	Overall this works very well.  It doesn't understand my voice but I haven't found anything yet that does.  Good value and the spring clasp works well and allows several options for hanging it.
5	1402185600	It is fantastic! Plenty of volume. Easy to pair with one or two phones. Simple to operate. Automatic shut off gives wonderful battery life. Liked it so much I ordered a second for my wife's vehicle. Would recommend it to anyone.
3	1402099200	Great sound and loud.  I like the motiom detection so I do not have ro turn it on and off. Voice detection, on the other hand, is not as great.  I will tell it to call &#34;wife mobile&#34; and it will say &#34; redialing&#34; which causes me to instantly have to hit cancel as I may not be sure who I called last.  It does respond to answer and ignore commands well though for incoming calls.  The Fm transmitter to the radio is average at best and sound quality on the radio is not as good as regular radio, so I often find myself just listening to music from my phone to the jabra itself.
3	1402012800	I liked it until I was told that the volume at the other end of the phone was very low and also that there was a lot of back ground noise.I am back on the market for a blue tooth speaker phone.Any suggestions ?
3	1402012800	I am on a Quixote-like quest to find a blue booth speakerphone that people can hear me well, and I can hear them well plus one that  doesn't fall apart within a year.This model is the best I have purchased (one of seven different models from various brands over the past five years) - I actually bought two of them because people couldn't hear me after six months with  the first (customer service told me un-paring and re-paring would solve that... NOT).The Freeway has been superior to anything from BlueAnt (switch broke after 90 days, weird interface, and terrible call quality) Motorola (poor performance), or other Jabra models.
5	1402012800	The price of this product is fair and it has great feature. I would recommend it to anyone wanting good quality at a reasonable price.
1	1402012800	I purchased mine in October 2013, and as of June 2014, it no longer plays music through the unit or through the radio.  With only a month warranty, it is definitely not worth the $68.00 I paid for it.  Very disappointed!  :(
2	1401926400	Honestly, I only bought it to compare against my company's product the ClipSee which sounds a lot better on the listening end.
5	1401840000	I installed this item in my car without any problem, it is a good item,I installed this item in my car without any problem, it is a good item-works very well -good invention, I hope it last in the summer sun
1	1401840000	The product was sold as new product, but when I received it I found it in a box filled with newspaper. Also, there was a dent it looks like that the item was drop.The product itself was good, but I didn't like the fact that I bought a used product as new.
4	1401840000	Loved it at first---  but when we added a second device it starting acting up.  Now it doesn't always work when I try to make a call and I have to turn my phone off and on or the Jabra off and on&#8230;  Now my husbands phone won't stop connecting to it, so it has become very frustrating.  Also, when you walk out into the driveway if you are on the phone, it connects to the car, or makes you lose the call.  It has great clarity and is simple to use=---- just don't hook up more than one phone,  and if you turn it off when you leave the car you won't have to deal with it connecting if you get too close.
4	1401753600	I enjoy using my Jabra, it provides me a safer way to drive and talk. The only issue is when the phone rings I call out&#34;Answer&#34; and at times it wont answer or understand my commands. But for the most part I love using it
1	1401753600	Save your money!  I bought one of these and returned it.  Unlike my built in hands free in my new car, this device does not let you confirm who you want to call when you use phone commands and try calling by name.  It just decides who to call!  I gave a command to call my work phone on my way to work at 5 am but it heard something else and decided to call my cousin and didn't ask me to confirm, at which time I could have stopped it.  Needless to say I was most embarrassed when it started ringing my cousin who was sound asleep. Also it seemed to get very confused with suri on my iPhone. The phone commands are a complete bust and a deal breaker for me.  Very disappointed.
5	1401753600	This is simply the best, most user friendly handsfree I have ever used. The sound from the three speaker unit itself is fine, but its FM connection is easy to set up and delivers the blue tooth signal from your phone, to Freeway and then to the radio, giving you access to your car's sound system. Very nicely thought out product. I bought a second one for my buddy.
5	1401753600	I gave this Bluetooth device to my Dad because I bought a new car with Bluetooth capability. However, my brother also bought one and they both love it! When I had it I loved it too! I could totally hear the other person on the other line clearly as well as they could hear me very well. I would buy this again if I had too!
5	1401667200	This is such an upgrade from my previous hands-free device.  I don't need to use my hands at all -- I use voice commands.  I love it that I'm told who's calling and can choose whether to take the call.  I can do it all without looking at my phone or using my hands.  Blue tooth seems to be standard in cars now, but my car isn't new.  I have learned that I come in clearer to whomever I'm talking with if I lower the visor a bit so it's closer to my mouth.  No more stress for me when my  phone rings and I'm driving.  I could place calls, also, but haven't needed to do so yet.
3	1401580800	It was ok it does not work right every time fm has static on it voice connection  don't  respond all the time but it ok
1	1401408000	Does not work at all. Very unhappy with this product. Would not reccomend to anyone to buy this item.  Will you replace this unit with something that works?
1	1401408000	I received my jabra Freeway on time,but have nothing but trouble with this device since.It keeps disconnecting,I cant make voice commands at all.There tech support has not been very helpful.No one to talk to,every thing by email.not satisfied at all with this product.
5	1401408000	This product works great, it is well worth the price.  Very load and clear and holds the charge even though it comes with the car charger for convenience.
4	1401321600	This is good item to buy. It works perfectly with any Bluetooth device. I recommends it to anyone to buy.
5	1401235200	I read many reviews before I decided to get this item. The sound quality and battery life is most important to me. I use this in the Honda Civic 2000, an old car, that doesn't have very good window sealing so when I drive in the freeway there's a lot of background noise. Perhaps this bluetooth speakerphone has good noise cancellation because my friends and family said it sounds like I was holding the phone. They couldn't tell that I was using a speakerphone.I felt that this blueotooth speakerphone has better noise cancellation feature than the bluetooth speaker that came with my other car, Honda Civic 2009. I always have to yell/scream/talk really loudly whenever I drive my 2009 car, which has bluetooth installed. As for the Jabra Freeway bluetooth speaker, when I put it on the visor above my forehead, I can talk on normally and my friends said it sound like as if I was holding the phone. I enjoyed driving my older car more just because of this Jabra speakerphone.
4	1401235200	Yup, still working good so far.  Connects easily, was a breeze to initially program.  Why 4 stars and not 5?  Speaker STILL not loud enough for me.  Better than most other Bluetooth speakerphones I have had in my noisy 87' Toyota pick-up, though........
4	1401148800	This one works too.once you program it stays programmed ,you dont have to do nothing.once you are in range ,it tells you connected. Works great hands-free no tickets
4	1401148800	Compact and easy to use. Great battery life. I can connect 2 phones at the same time. Stream music and connect to car audio.
5	1401148800	I bought this to replace my Jabra Tour Bluetooth Speakerphone. The Freeway comes through loud and clear on both ends of the conversation with no annoying background noises. I've even used it with the window rolled down with no complaints from the person on the other end. The Tour was fine on my side of the conversation but everybody had a hard time hearing me on their end; it would cut out and there was so much background noise it was impossible to listen to.
4	1401148800	I didn't really have high hopes for this unit but I was surprised...it's much better than I expected.  Call quality is good, sensitivity is good and the battery life seems to be better than average.My phone (Samsung S5) and this unit don't always communicate so I have to 'disconnect' and 'connect' at least twice a week-which is the reason for -1 star.
5	1401148800	The sound quality and volume of this speaker are perfect for what i need.  I use it very often and am not disappointed.
5	1400976000	Sound quality is excellent. Battery life is long, at least two weeks. Integrates perfectly with IPhone 5 and 5s. With a push of a button on the Freeway, Siri is activated.
5	1400976000	I changed to Jabra and i am impressed. If like me you value safety while driving, buy one.I use an IPhone and some of the features do not work but Jabra do point that out so i am happy with that.
3	1400889600	The speakerphone itself worked well.  However the Bluetooth seemed to interact with my car's aftermarket alarm system.  I would park in front of my apartment and go inside (over 30 feet and it would disconnect from my phone), but then the alarm would keep spontaneously going off.  I had to disable the alarm system by removing a fuse from the fuse box just to stop it from happening.  After reconnecting, it wouldn't happen anymore as long as the Jabra was off.  Once I started using it again, the same issue would happen.  I had the car looked at by a professional, and nothing was found to be wrong.  I had the car's battery replaced, as well as the batteries in my car's keyfobs (as this can sometimes cause issues with the alarm).  It kept happening until I determined it was the Jabra.  Unfortunately I have to return it.  I'll try a different speakerphone, but there's a chance this may happen with all of them.  Very strange because I couldn't find any similar issues online.
4	1400803200	I wanted a headset free bluetooth and this fits the bill. The audio is clear. My callers can hear me and I can hear them. As several other posters commented though, the voice commands are not ideal. If I want to call someone while driving, I'll use Seri and the caller is instantly on the bluetooth set. Otherwise, I'm happy with the device.
5	1400716800	I liked the Jebra FREEWAY because I have seen it before used by a friend of mine so I thought to buy one and Amazon was the place to get it from.
5	1400716800	Excellent results great value too. Thanks for the great service!! I will continue using your services and will recommend it to all of my family and friends !
5	1400716800	I have been looking for a reasonably priced way to use my phone in my car without headphones.  I have used a bluetooth, headphones (in one ear), and a plugged in speaker.  The FREEWAY allows me to make and answer calls, as well as listen to music and podcasts.  I am really happy with the sound quality as well.  If you have an older car, like me, without a handsfree option, buy the Jabra FREEWAY.
3	1400716800	this is a great little device it helps hands free and it does work well I like how it has the FM radio 88.1 2 talk through your speakers and allows you to hear a little better while you're on the phone expected a little bit more out of the sound quality though but other than that it is pretty good
2	1400630400	Almost every person has complained about hearing me.  The unit seems to work ok on the user's end.  I can hear callers fairly well, but almost all have complained that convo is choppy or fuzzy.  Too bad!  Also, unit is hard to use.  I often have a hard time getting it to understand my response to an incoming call.  The unit is also a bit cumbersome to use.  Not thrilled with it, but the battery life is good.
3	1400630400	Both work great on receiving calls, but the voice recognition for placing calls is very poor.  When trying to access your phone to make a call, you are prompted to say &#34;phone commands&#34;.  Maybe one out of 10 times does it recognize what you are asking.  This goes for all the other voice commands also.  Both my wife and I have the same problem with these speakerphones.
5	1400371200	Hands down the very best Bluetooth speakerphone I have ever used. Clear quality, loud sound & reliable connectivity. If you want a Bluetooth for your car - stop looking & buy it.
5	1400284800	I would Definitely recommend this one. Jabra has 2 and this is the newer and better one. Clear and easy to use  sounds like they are right there. No background noise. This company sent it promptly and well packaged. I loved it so much I ordered another one which I got one for my son in law and he loves it and recommends it to everyone Easy to use
5	1400284800	Takes calls, plays podcasts perfectly clear, works with Audible.com books.  I can't live without this thing anymore.However, you should have realistic expectations about voice commands and whatnot.  Android (and even Siri) have always been sketchy at best.  As long as we have words like &#34;sun&#34; vs &#34;son&#34;, these devices won't have perfect speech recognition.  So I've given up on asking it to call certain people; I just pick up my phone and tap a speed dial.But I've done a ton of calls and audiobook listening just fine on this speaker/phone.
5	1400284800	I've been using one of these for a couple of years.  It's not perfect, wind/road noise still comes through, but not as bad as cheaper units.  The ability to use 2 devices is essential - a perfect &#34;his&her&#34; solution.  In comparison, my $30,000 Prius only uses one paired device at a time...
3	1400198400	Sounds great but others say I sound horrible. Going to contact Jane's for a replacement.  Maybe I just got a bad unit.
5	1400198400	I use it, my wife use, and I just sent one to my sister... a real user friendly... one time set up then all you have to is keep it charged...
5	1400198400	I love it...Great if you don't have this feature in your car then buy this one ...you will love it..thanks..
3	1400112000	Only one time have I gotten it to tell me the expected battery life right after I got. Since then i have tried many many times possibly as many as twenty times saying battery and it either request I repeat what i said, tells me valid commands or once it tried to call voice assist.The speaker sounds good and those i have spoken to using the device say that I sound very clear.  It is just disappointing that the voice recognition couldn't be any better.
4	1400112000	This looks, feels and sounds great but w/ my iPhone 5 it cannot even get close when I ask it to dial a certain person. It dials - but always the incorrect person and not even close to the name I request - and sometimes when I ask it to dial a number it plays music instead. Otherwise it is great.
4	1400112000	I must say, within the first week, I fully expected to return this unit.  I'm going to go a little off topic to tell you that my "Go-to" headsets are thePlantronics Voyager Legendand I keep a chargedJabra SUPREMEon-hand as a backup.  Both of these work fine within the car while driving.  A quick aside, I lost my Plantronics recently and quickly replaced it.  I can power on the Plantronics and it fires up and answers the call immediately.  The Jabra Supreme takes a minimum of 5 seconds.Back to the FREEWAY:When I received the unit, I charged it fully and placed it in the car, on my visor.  It seemed to work decent for calls and music, with a mild amount of static when using the FM transmitter function. During my tests, there were some instances -- even with the windows up -- that callers could simply not hear me.  I had to use a normal headset.  But other times, it seems to work great.Voice commands seemed to work okay as well.  Since I have theJabra SUPREMEheadset, I'm familiar with all of the voice commands.  Another funny thing is, if you have the FREEWAY and SUPREME paired/connected to your iPhone at the same time, the incoming caller announcement with the name and "Answer or Ignore" prompt comes through on both devices at the exact same time... I've not tried saying "Answer" to see if both will hear the voice command though!  I just push the button on the device I want the call routed to.Read more about the positive and negative further down..&#9658; FM TRANSMITTER / MUSIC &#9668;This is where I realized that this unit excels.  Just amazing.  Not out of the box, however -- I realized how to do it the first time that I was playing music via FM and the battery in the device was low.  I plugged in the charger and immediately, I heard nothing but static.  You simply can't use the FM while it is charging, presumably due to the electrical noise associated with charging.  BUT -- once you have a good charge, here's the trick:&#9679; PLUG IN A USB CABLE TO THE FREEWAY, but DON'T PLUG THE OTHER END INTO THE CHARGER!!  Now, your entire USB cable is a giant FM antenna!!!  For me, since my front window has the antenna embedded into the top of the windshield, I wrapped the USB cable around my rear-view mirror and plugged it in to the Micro-USB port.  Even with a mediocre FM station, this thing will give you almost flawless audio.  (Another trick:  Don't MAX out the audio on your phone, it causes some distortion.  Set it to 80% or so)To give you an idea how powerful it is, I had given anExcelvan FM Transmitterto a friend after I started using this device.  And the Excelvan was pretty good.  So, I pulled up next to him in a parking lot where he was jamming to some music on his phone as he waited for me to pull up to have lunch.  I rolled down my windows, and heard his music playing.  Then, I turned on the JABRA while still in my car, and it completely overpowered the other transmitter.  All you could hear was my music, nothing else, in his car.&#9658; GOOD Points &#9668;1. FM Transmitter!!2. Very long battery life (14 hours estimated) and it is very nice to not have to charge it too often.3. Speaker is fairly loud and callers sound very good at a reasonable volume.4. Music sounds decent as well using only the device speakers.5. Easy access to power on/off slider switch.6. Nice size -- very small and light, while still feeling sturdily made and good quality.7. Micro-USB charging port&#9658; BAD / ANNOYING &#9668;1. And this is definitely #1.  The Auto-power-off function works sometimes.  Nice.  Handy.  However, when it doesn't work, it goes something like this:  I receive a phone call on my iPhone 5S, talking on my Bluetooth headset for a while.  I'm sitting there, rambling away, when I realize I haven't heard the other party say anything for a while.  I look down at my phone and see that the FREEWAY is connected, and the call audio has been routed to my unoccupied car for who-knows-how-long.  (Mind you, my car is parked across the street, at least 150 feet away!)  I click on the screen to transfer it back to my Plantronics when I catch the end of a long "eeelllllooo??" from the other end.  I apologize and continue.  Few minutes later, again it happens.  Moral of the story:  Don't rely on the auto-power-off unless you enjoy repeating yourself and making extra trips to your car to turn the thing off.  (This may not happen on Android because, last I used an Android, you couldn't have two Headsets connected at once)2. Speaker(s) rattle if you turn the volume up beyond a certain point.  Doesn't seem right for a device purporting to have superior multi-speaker design.3. Unable to use FM transmitter mode while charging the device.  I don't think I can hear anything but static from the radio when plugged in to the charger.&#9658; NITPICKING &#9668;1. Unit doesn't remember that FM was on when you turn off/back on.2. Long announcement when you turn FM mode back on.  (FM on One 0 Five Point One Megahertz) -- Seems like an eternity.  The FM light is sufficient.  Announce the frequency if I change it!  (Note: Per the manual, "Voice Guidance and Voice commands are enabled as the default setting when you turn on your Jabra FREEWAY the first time. You can at any time disable both by pressing the Voice button while you slide the power switch into the On position.")  Kind of disappointing that you have to disable the voice commands to turn off the verbal annunciation.3. Extremely easy to activate redial and other functions on the device while you are repositioning it.  (The Answer/End/Redial button is the entire width of the unit)I hope this review helps you!  I know I was so excited to finally have a good FM transmitter, nevermind the other features, and wanted to be sure to share the wealth with others.Post a comment and let me know if this helps you and if you have the same success using the micro-USB cable to boost your FM output!&#9787;
4	1400025600	I damaged the usb charging cable for the speaker (my own fault it got tangled in a pile of stuff I was carrying and dropped).  I contacted Jabra customer service via their website to ask for the part number and how I could order a new one.  I clearly stated the damaged was my fault.  They are sending me a new one, priority mail and are not charging me for it.Now that is customer service PLUS
3	1400025600	It's ok. It is loud enough but when I ask to dial/call a contact it dials an 800 number in which one has to give the command again. It won't dial the caller right away like Siri. Also, can't be used with my older model am/fm car radio. Battery lasts a long time. The voice quality needs improvement when on a call.
5	1400025600	Love the Jabra bluetooth speakerphone. This is our second one, we had the cruiser. This is a great improvement. It turns itself on and off. When you go out of range of it, it shuts off. Rarely have to charge it. I highly recommend. Bought it for Father's Day, and he appreciates it every day!
4	1400025600	Pretty cool.I got this for my &#34;old&#34; car after we got a new car with integrated Bluetooth.  I had gotten spoiled by the hands free functionality and I never liked any of my Bluetooth ear pieces.I happy with the Freeway.It actually does more than our newer car's integrated system.  An apple person. This jabra device enables me to use SIRI in every way I'm accustomed to.Decent sound quality... With any speakerphone there can be issues... ESPECIALLY when talking to another speakerphone. Still, I like it.
5	1399939200	I had a BlueAnt. I had to charge it all the time even though I had it on save mod there would be a delay to connect to my phone. The Jabra speaker sounds so much sounds so much better. My husbands sometimes has to ask if i am still on because it is so quiet. It also connects right away to my phone and the battery last a long time.
5	1399852800	I absolutely love this thing. It clips on the sun visor and it turns itself on and off as you enter the vehicle, and it's super easy to set up. I don't bother with radio stations or cd's anymore. Just pick a playlist on my iPhone and go. It will play through the vehicle speakers if you want it to, and I usually do. Great gadget!
1	1399852800	I bought 2 of these 1 for my fiancee and the other one for myself . i have to always disconnect it when on phone calls because others can't here me very well . I know because when my girlfriend calls me on her habra freeway it makes me crazy I comprehend  every 3rd or 5th word its very frustrating . I don't like how it keeps you connected after you get out of your car
5	1399766400	1. Connects to iPhone immediately and easily2. Works with Siri perfectly.3. Good sound when listening.4. Good microphone since when I receive a call on my home phone and the caller is using the Jabra Freeway the sound is clear and there is minimal or no background noise.5. Sound through car's FM is good. I live in a metropolitan area so finding a &#34;clear&#34; FM frequency is difficult. That is not a critique of the speakerphone, just a fact of the area I live in.6. Music from iPhone through speakerphone is good but once again finding a clear FM frequency is difficult in my area.7. I previously purchased a Jabra Freeway in the retail packaging for a few dollars more. I liked it so much I wanted to get another for our second car. At that time I ran across the unit in the retail packaging for a few dollars less. The units are identical and both come with a car charger and USB cable.8 Unit charges with a normal USB micro cable and any wall charger I tried.
5	1399766400	Works great. I do have a very bad company phone (es400) so I cannot use all the options.It sounds great, and people hear me good
2	1399680000	I get a lot of static when I try to plug my iPhone in to play Pandora and still not sure how to get it to make calls and answer them for me
3	1399680000	Good clear audio from speaker, incoming calls works great.With outgoing calls it is a big problem getting it to understandmine and also my wife's spoken commands...which can be veryfrustrating.  I have a friend who also has the same problem withhis.... same model...I would most likely &#34;not&#34; purchase another.
5	1399680000	the Jabra is everything I wanted and more.  The sounds is great with not a lot of background noise.  The caller on the other end has no problem with the sound quality either.  I highly recommend this device to anyone needing a hands free device for their car.  It also automatically connect when you enter the car.  I have a bluetooth headset also  was a pain to connect evert time I entered the car. As a salesman who is in and out of my car all day, this is a nice feature.  I haven't used any of the other features but the phone feature is great!
1	1399593600	Not a reliable product, great sound but it keeps disconnecting from the phone. I returned this item back to Amazon .
5	1399507200	I bought the Freeway for my son's 1st car. It's older so it does not have Bluetooth. He really like it. It works well with his iphone both for calls as well as for streaming his music through the radio. Sound quality is decent when listening to music. If you are looking for concert hall quality, then forget this device and invest in a new car. The Freeway is a sound choice if you are looking for a hands free device with a lot of cool features at a decent price.
4	1399507200	No question, I'm glad I got this for my non-bluetooth equipped car.  It has good sound quality and great battery life (I charge it once a week).  The music streaming feature was disappointing. When it transmits to the unit's speaker, it's too small a sound to really enjoy your music and when you stream to an FM station, it's way too staticy to really enjoy (at least in a large city like LA with so many FM stations). BUT, if you're looking for a sleek, cool-looking bluetooth device to help prevent a ticket or worse, an accident, then this is a great choice and frankly, I doubt streaming would sound much better on the other devices I considered.
4	1399507200	This does what it's supposed to, which is to keep your hands off the phone while driving.  Sound quality is fine, but can be hard to understand over the ambient car noise.  Callers say my voice sounds a bit &#34;far away&#34; but still understandable.  Voice commands are rudimentary but ok.  Making calls using &#34;phone command&#34; is a little hit or miss (such as &#34;call work&#34; or &#34;call &#60;phone number&#62;&#34;) since voice recognition is mediocre.  Basic commands such as &#34;call back&#34; or &#34;answer&#34; works most of the time, but occasional misunderstandings occur and I don't have much of an accent.  FM transmitter is not too good, there's too much static no matter what channel I use.  Streaming music to the car speakers is ok and has good bass, but don't expect high fidelity sound.  Despite these shortcomings, I still like it since I'm not distracted from driving while answering calls from work.
4	1399507200	I didn't say, great sound, just better than not having a direct plug in. It's limited in sound and volume.
5	1399420800	WORKS AS ADVERTISED, ANY BODY THAT SAYS THEY CANT HEAR IT VERY WELL,NEEDS TO PUT IT ON FM , AND YOU CAN RATTLE THE WINDOWS, IT MIS SO LOUD. EASY TO OPERATE. JUST HOOK IT TO YOUR VISOR , TURN IT ON AND YOU ARE ALL SET.
5	1399420800	great product. I have a bluetooth system in my vehicle but I use this because it works so much better
4	1399420800	I would give it a 5 star if it wasn't that for some reason when when am talking it keeps connecting and disconnection and it gets annoying. I have a nexus 4 so what i do is I first turn on my blutooth and then i turn the Jabra and it works fine, but if i conncect Jabra first and then go to my phone and turn on my bluetooth then that's when it gives me problems. Other than that when it works it has a great speaker volume no complaints on that and i can hear clearly..
4	1399420800	The items arrived on time and works well in the vehicle.  Easy to program although one of our phones we have had to re-pair twice after recharging the speakerphone.  Also, the voice recognition capability is ok at best.  BUT for the price, you get what you get.  As a speakerphone option, it is well worth the price.
4	1399334400	As a delivery driver I need to use the phone quite often while driving. Would give the Jabra 5 stars, but it breaks up sometimes for no good reason.
5	1399334400	I was very surprised when i took this out the box, not realising before I bought how small this is. Fits easily on your Sun visor in the car, or even use it as a bluetooth wireless speaker in any occasion. The sound is pretty loud. Can get muffled out a bit if your car window is open, but that is to be expected.Connected very easily with my Samsung S4. Clarity is pretty decent on phone calls too.Overall I am very happy with this purchase. Got exactly what I expected.
5	1399334400	The Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth is fabulous! I've been using it for a couple months now and I am very pleased with it.  I'm a realtor, in my car a lot, needing to multi task making/receiving phone calls all day and the FREEWAY works great.  Very clear, easy to use and the battery lasts for a very long time before needing to plug it in to recharge.  I'm so happy with it, I'm going to buy them for Christmas gifts for my entire family.  Everyone should have such a great hands free devise.  The only hiccup I've had with it is a few times I've asked it to &#34;answer&#34; when a call is coming in and it replies &#34;Call Declined&#34; or something like that so make sure to speak slow and clear.
2	1399334400	I found it hard to believe all the negative customer reviews after reading some of the major online reviews that said it was great. After buying it, I must agree with the negative ones. The setup is simple and it functions fine as long as you don't need the FM transmitter. If that's your plan then save your time and aggravation and buy something else. The FM function on this thing is totally useless. I tried it on every possible station and it just doesn't work well enough to even call it a feature. It is barely audible and it is mostly static. The built-in speakers are decent and function fine for the speakerphone, but naturally not nearly as good as your car speakers for audio streaming.
5	1399334400	Love this Bluetooth speakerphone. It's sounds clear, and connects instantly which I love. Sometimes you have to wait like 30 seconds for the device to connect, but this one connects as soon as you turn it on. Easy to use.
4	1399248000	Despite the few negative comments that I read in the review, I decided the give it a shot. Well, it turns out that the Jabra Freeway is indeed what I needed. It worked just fine. Set-up was easy and it's already in my car! Used the FM to transmit the sound of movies from iPad and the sounds is great, no more squeaky sound from the tiny speaker of the iPad now!Making calls and answering calls with the voice command is almost 90% accurate, can't complaint anyway, there will always be limitations. Would have given it a 5 star rating if it's perfect. Sound quality based on feedback from callers were also good.
5	1399161600	If you want to use the voice assist you have to get a subscription.  It does come with a one year free sub with the purchase, but I don't think I really need it because one part of the voice commands simply transfers the activity to your phone so you just say &#34;voice commands&#34; and then Siri (or whatever program your phone normally uses) takes over and you tell it to &#34;call home&#34; or other such things.  Love the motion sensor - really makes it convenient - as soon as you sit down it says &#34;connected&#34;.  I just leave it plugged into the power all the time so it never loses charge.
3	1399161600	I really stopped using this unit because it wouldn't pick up a call before someone would hang up.I just keep it so the cops can see I have one.
4	1399075200	Hi,Push one button to answer your calls, it's like the caller is sitting next to you.Two pushes on the button and it will call back the last number you dialed on your cell phone.
1	1398988800	Not as expected at all, voice commands are not accurate which make you confused during driving instead of supporting you, even the sound quality of playing music or songs is not good at all , I really regret to buy this product and I prefer my old Jabra model
2	1398988800	Hello all. Im going to give a very short and sweet review. you can see others have given more in-depth reviews.the Freeway was very easy to set up. The volume can get very loud however.....the voice call answer doesnt always understand me. people always complain that they cannot hear me. I had to fiddle with the volume of the device and cell phone to get the proper balance.  I cannot for the life of me get the unit to broadcast on FM. In my area the default FM station has a station on it already-- therefore im SOL
5	1398988800	I've had this for about 3 weeks now, and the functionality with Siri has been spot on.  I don't bother with any of the built-in voice commands since Siri does what I need just fine and with no additional learning curve.It's been on for 3 weeks and I'm still around 65% battery (although admittedly I don't spend *lots* of time talking).  The motion sensing works great -- I would hate to have to remember to turn it on and off.  Other bluetooth auto-off devices rely on your phone being out of range which can be hit or miss when your car is nearby in the garage.  This unit has no problem figuring out I'm out of the car.The audio streaming works fine, although I prefer to use the aux in on my car stereo for that.  For you iPhone users (mine is a 5s), the good news is that when you get in the car the Freeway says &#34;connected&#34; yet when you plug in the aux cable the phone is smart enough to know that it should play music through your stereo but calls through the Freeway.  The auto muting of sounds still works perfectly even though they are getting routed to multiple destinations.  This was a pleasant surprise.  I believe this is all a function of the phone, though, and not the Freeway so YMMV.  Based on my prior experience with Android phones this might not work quite so smoothly, again depending on the particular model of phone.  All I can say for sure is that with an iPhone 5s (and I'm guessing any iOS7 device) it works great.I tried the FM transmitter mode and found it to be far less great than just using the built-in speaker.  Didn't matter to me so I didn't deduct a star.If I had any complaint it would be that occasionally the full-duplex operation is a little iffy.  In other words, if someone is talking to you and you talk over them, the onboard mic stays muted and the other person doesn't hear what you said.  This is most noticeable at higher speeds when there is a lot of noise in the car.  I suspect the auto-mute detection struggles a bit in that environment.  I *almost* deducted a star for this but the rest of the product is so solid that I can't bring myself to do so.I can't comment on the built-in voice commands because as I mentioned earlier I prefer Siri.All in all I have been pleased enough to buy one for my daughter (who loves it too) as well as recommend to my friends.  If you don't have a hands-free thing like this for your car and are fumbling around with headsets like I did for years do yourself a favor and buy this thing.  If you're like me you'll be kicking yourself for not having done it long ago.
5	1398902400	This little gizmo finds and connects to my bluetooth phone easily and quickly, every single time. My Jeep Grand Cherokee, however, can't seem to figure it out. My only suggestion is that they provide a higher volume upper limit. It's a bit too quiet in a noisy driving situation. Voice quality is, however, clear and intelligible, both sending (or so people tell me) and receiving.
4	1398902400	Well made, works very well connecting to land line or cellular phones.I bought two units, for me and my wife. The only issue I recognize, the connection is very week with lots of statics if the calls made between the same two units. I called Jabra customer service reporting this important issue.
2	1398902400	I just received this yesterday from Amazon. Charged it for 2 hours. While charging I phoned 1-800-362-5703 and asked some questions about VoiceAssist. I was told it was like OnStar. Later In talking with Jabra I was told that was not true at all. I was also told the Music features would not work with the iPhone 5S but may work with later firmware. Since then I have had problems with it understanding me (Seri and Google understand me just fine). Jabra support said I have to keep practicing. The Voice Assist software is not available as the web site has been down now for 14 hours. Jabra says they have nothing to do with that &#34;3rd party promotion&#34;. I was told Seri does as good or better for voice to text messaging as the Voice Assist. When I asked then why would I want it I was told to have the option to Seri, but with the iPhone it would still be dependent on Seri. Jabra gave me a phone number for Voice Assist. I called it and it says &#34;Welcome to Voice Assist. Have a great day good bye&#34; and hangs up.
3	1398902400	Not totally hands free. You can't say &#34;call&#34; and initiate a hands free call. Incoming calls are easy with a simple answer or ignore voice command. You have to be careful touching the unit because it is easy to hang up calls.
2	1398902400	I am generally a fan of Jabra products, but had a very bad luck with this speakerphone. It started randomly dropping connection after 3 weeks of use. Unfortunately, Amazon return window expired but I will try to contact the manufacturer. When it worked, it's a great product. Great sound quality, easy to use. I wish it would last longer than 3 weeks. Yesterday I got the same one from Costco, unlimited timeline for returns was the decision factor for me.
5	1398902400	i connected  with my cell phone was very good for calling .the voice was clear.and no noise. but for android phone has some problem also with reconnect.
1	1398816000	All very nice, but its main purpose is to place/receive phone calls in a voice-command manner. It is simply unable to understand the voice commands. This still allows receiving and ending incoming calls by pressing a button, but outgoing calls cannot be initiated reliably.
3	1398816000	The Brand is good . But this Bluetooth Speakerphone voice not good .  and small voice .  I should not be .
4	1398729600	Very similar to the Roadster II, but with two big advantages.  The Roadster II is very erratic in its auto on/off behavior.  Sometimes it would wait ten minutes after I was on the road to turn on.  Sometimes it would stay connected after I parked my car and went into my office.  Sometimes it would try to link to other drivers' bluetooth devices driving by.  The Jabra Freeway does none of this.  It turns on and off when its supposed to.  The speakers are better too.  My one complaint is that when I need to flip my visor to get shade from the sun, it often triggers buttons on the device.
5	1398729600	This Bluetooth is great. Love the item.First Bluetooth purchased with great clarity.  I will recommend to my friends. The price is also great.
1	1398729600	I tried the freeway but the FM transmitter was weak.  The Cruiser 2 broadcast clearly through the radio in my truck.  So I sent the Freeway back, I'm very happy with the Cruiser 2.
2	1398729600	Could not get unit to understand me when I said &#34;phone commands&#34; and therefore could not make calls. Returned and got Motorola Roadster 2 instead, which works better for me.
5	1398643200	I bought this for my wife's 2005 Acura, which didn't have Bluetooth and she was always rummaging in her handbag when the phone rang.  Set up was snap....it worked right out of the box.  Love the auto-connect feature and the power saving that occurs because it will remain in standby until it senses when there's a phone nearby and turns on.  I haven't used its ability to play music through the FM radio as we bought it mostly for the safety that comes with hands free operation. It's a great value at the Amazon price.
2	1398556800	its not true noise cancellation, people can't even hear me when I'm driving on a highway they said I  Sound like im in a wind tunnel
1	1398556800	While in the house testing it out, no matter what name from my cell phone I tried to call, it repeatedly called the same number.  When I put it on the visor of my van, it only tells me how many hours of power I have left and will not call a number.  A piece of junk.
5	1398470400	After reading some other reviews and doing some research, I purchased this hands free bluetooth speakerphone over a year ago.  It wasn't the cheapest device out there but Jabra is a trusted name and I liked the sleek design.  It works very well in the car.  My wife and I pair our cell phones to it and it announces &#34;connected&#34; when we're in range.  It clips to your visor and only comes on when it senses someone in the driver's seat.  Sound quality is pretty good and the mic has no problem picking up a talker in the passenger seat. If you don't have a late model car with bluetooth built-in, this is an excellent option and you can take it to any car.  The unit is also light enough that it doesn't interfere with the visor's movement or positioning.  We charge it about once a week with average use.  You could leave it charging all the time, but the dangling power cord is unsightly.
5	1398384000	Best blue tooth for a vehicle I have used. Battery lasts a very long time. Turns itself on and off. Very clear on both ends. Highly recommend this product!
5	1398297600	Does everything as advertised, even FM transmitter (which presented by the reviews seems to not be useful) but for me the FM transmitter worked 9/10 ; some static sometimes.. I just make it to 90.3 (I live in so cal) and its like amazingFlaws: The voice command is a bit off and you have to practice how to say the commands in a way so that the device will recognize it..Another thing is that you cant say &#34;call Andrew&#34; or something you have to say &#34;phone commands&#34; (then it launches default phone command app, which on mine SUCKS), and THEN you can say &#34;call Andrew&#34;TLDR = ok so its a good product does everything as advertised, great battery, good FM transmitter, all right sound, but bad voice recognition and you really have to speak in a way so that the device recognizes it (for me its over-annunciating my words, speaking them a little quieter than I think I would and faster too&#34;
5	1398297600	This model and brand seems better than any of the several I've used in the past. It's easy to set up and use, Has clear audio (which I need during lengthy business calls while driving). The battery life is very good. This product exceeded expectations.
4	1398297600	Love it - great sound.  The FM feature is &#34;ok&#34; because it doesn't search for an available &#34;static&#34; channel, it just goes up and down which I guess is nice depending on how you look at it but for a commuter who travels an hour you have to switch channels multiple times so it isn't feasible which leads me to my comments about the internal speakers.  They are actually not bad though I wish they were louder.  The battery doesn't last as long as my last M505 Motorola of the same type of item but overall looks nicer and works better.  Just wish the battery lasted longer and that the FM out signal was strong enough to take over channels rather than barely compete with them.
5	1398211200	Needed a handsfree speakerphone that looks sexy and runs well...just like my sportscar.  Finds the phone easily, great acoustics, and connects to radio.  Sure beats having a jawbone sticking out of my ear.  Highly recommended
5	1398124800	sound is great, my son loves it because he can play his music through FM radio.  Only challenge is when a 3rd person wants to pair their phone you have to forget the device and then repair.  But for two phones it pairs great and reconnects when you get into the car.
5	1398124800	Packaged very well. Jabra Freeway worked so well my neighbor bought him one. Don't believe you can beat it. Easiest to program.
5	1398124800	I love the motion sensor feature... I don't ever have to do anything to turn it on or off... you get in the car, and it says &#34;connected&#34; .  when you climb out, it cuts off... I don't touch it.  Its just there when I need it. perfect.  Good sound quality also, and fm modulator works well also.
1	1398038400	Not sure what others see in this thing.  The sound is awful.  you have to scream at it to get it to answer the phone.  Pay for voice activation????  Roadster is free!!!!  I can on and on about how bad this was.  I bought two for me and the wife.  We went back to buying roadsters.  Our old roadsters gave up the ghost.  We tried these and they are terrible.  three speakers or not.  The Freeway was not what they say it is.  Tried two in four different cars, they just don't work.
3	1398038400	This thing does everything great except for one thing, the FM tuner.  I just can't find a station where I do not get a lot of static.  It is the easiest thing in the world to use - I didn't even have to read the manual, and this was my first foray into bluetooth.  The features were fantastic, the internal speaker is good enough for phone calls and spoken words.  In my opinion, music requires better speakers though.  If you have no plans to stream music, then I highly recomend this device, as it is easy to transfer between cars and the integration with my Galaxy S3 was simple.
4	1398038400	very nice unit when I enter vehicle automatically recognizes me ,easy to operate sound is very clearonly issue some people have trouble understanding me
2	1398038400	It worked great at first, but now the sound is very &#34;buzzy&#34;.  I would not buy one again.  The other features are good, and it is a shame that the speaker quality is not better.
4	1398038400	Overall a good product.  Easy to pair and good sound quality on both ends of the conversation.I had trouble issuing voice commands while driving.  The device would not recognize even the simplest commands.  It worked well when the car was not running, but again overall sound/voice quality was good.I use it all the time and am happy with it other than the voice command input while driving.
2	1397865600	Pros:Connects right awayLooks niceCons:Picks up alot of background noise, no one can hear me when I talk to them with itshort battery lifeI'm unhappy with the product
4	1397865600	If you are trying to decide whether to buy this or the Motorola Roadster, buy this. I bought a Roadster a few years back and it worked well though the reception was tinny but understandable. After about 18 months it stopped taking a charge. I ordered a new Roadster 2 and it performed pretty much like the first one but died after one week. I returned it to Amazon and ordered the Jabra Freeway to replace it. The reception is much clearer and the party I'm talking with hears me much clearer than with the Roadster. Not only that, it is cheaper than the roadster. I have been using it for over a month now with few complaints. For some reason it doesn't respond when I press the phone icon though it did for the first week. Now I have to access Siri through my phone but it responds properly through the Jabra when I access it. I use it simply to answer the phone when I'm driving but rarely make calls. It does everything I want it to do, was easy to install and connects faster than the Roadster. Would have given it 5 stars if the phone icon worked properly. I can't say anything about the FM connection as I don't use it. Setup was as simple as turning it on and going to my Bluetooth settings on the phone.
5	1397865600	Works great with our Iphones - I bought two. Charge about once a month, nice audio, Siri likes it too.
4	1397865600	Sound quality overall is good but some music sounds come thru occasionally as a buzz...Voice sound quality is good making it much easier for me to have a phone converstion...Still learning some of the handsfree operations but I like what I have used so far..
2	1397865600	I am having problems with voice commands. It is not easy as I thought it would be. I can answer incoming (hand free). Not so easy on outgoing. I can key outgoing on my phone, however this takes away from the hand free
4	1397692800	easy to use and pair with smart phone. very clear for both callers,even listen to music through it. highly recommend.
5	1397692800	Love it! Best hands for free I've EVER had. It does all it says it does. Worth every dime ($76.00) I paid for it!
4	1397692800	auto power on-off is so comfortable and voice commander is easy.And supporting app. jabra assist is good for mamagement
5	1397692800	Replaced another brand on my GMC truck visor with this Freeway.  The sound far exceeds the unit we replaced.  Great bluetooth hookup, lets you know when it hooks up. Battery life seems to be forever.  Have only charged it once in 2 months.  Highly recommend this unit if hearing your phone calls loud and clear is a priority.
4	1397606400	I really like this little speakerphone.  It doesn't always understand what I'm saying, but it usually does.  I especially like using the FM transmitter with Siri and my music.  It plays everything clear as a bell when you find the right frequency, which isn't hard.  You just use the volume buttons to get to the next station.  When you hit the "voice" button, you can tell it to go to the next track, "phone commands" (which is siri if you have an iphone), or "voice assist".  You can also tell it to start or stop your music.  I have siri find an album I like and play it, and it works seamlessly.For making a call, I use voice assist (since it's free for a year) and Siri interchangeably, since they work equally as well.  Voice assist was giving me some problems in the beginning, but their customer service was ready and willing to help.  In the end, the issue resolved itself.  Maybe their system was down or something...I can hear people so well, especially using the FM transmission.  My husband says he can't tell when I'm talking on this versus my cell phone.  He says it's super clear.
5	1397606400	Our state requires hands-free in the car and this is a great option for me.  I like that it responds to voice command.  When I do need to press a button, it is easy to do even in motion.  A nice bonus is that I can stream music right to me while the kids have the vehicle speakers occupied during a movie.
2	1397520000	The advertised features sound great but the Jabra falls short in use with our Motorola Droid Razr M phones.  We struggled for several weeks to solve tech issues and finally got our phones to connect and work but still NOT consistently. Jabra tech support did respond by email on how to do a reset so that the pairing connection would work.  Unfortunately the documentation and Jabra website are too sketchy about setup issues and phone compatibility. From reading the reviews and searching for help, my guess is that iPhones might work better with Jabra but do not assume that performance will be the same for every phone brand. We finally got it working with our Android system phones and its voice command software after learning to allow password bypass in the Bluetooth mode (which is not mentioned in the documentation), The Jabra might work better by using their Voice Assist app but that requires paying a subscription after a trial period.  Misinterpretation of voice commands is our biggest problem along with inconsistent pairing of 2 phones and setting a primary one for making calls.  Otherwise, incoming calls work okay. But the button pushing (not hands-free), pairing and voice interpretation glitches make Jabra unreliable for outgoing calls.
5	1397433600	I got this for my mom since she does not have blue tooth in her car.She is just coming around to the technology world and got a smartphone which she has mastered.She absolutely LOVES it!Very easy to set up and crisp clear sound.Definitely worth the $
2	1397433600	Callers had hard time hearing me although i could hear them. On/off button is tiny. Charging light is impossible to see.
2	1397433600	The voice recognition system needs some work. It is relatively easy to get it to the &#34;Phone Command&#34; mode, however, I have a difficult time speaking through it to let my phone figure out what I said. I didnt have this issue when I used a headset before so I can only assume it is an issue with Jabra's microphone. Secondly, no matter how many times I tried, I can't get the thing to pick up the word 'Battery' (to check battery level). Either the voice recognition really sucks or something broke after one month of light use. I am returning this item. I gave it two stars because aside from the the problem I have with its voice recognition/command, I am pretty pleased with it. I can hear the conversation well while operating a vehicle, and nobody ever complains to me about background noise either.
4	1397347200	The Jabra Freeway is a good HF device for older cars, which don't have hands free built in.  The speaker sounds good in the car, is loud enough, and (a plus) can play your iTunes music as well.Some people whom I have called said that the voice on their end was a bit tinny and echo prone but it is better than holding your iphone in hand and driving.One minor irritation is that when using WAZE and getting updates, every time a WAZE announcement is completed the Freeway announces &#34;CALL ENDED&#34; before returning to either music or stand by.  Its annoying but, again, better than using the phone wth out the speaker.
4	1397260800	Didn't expect any more or any less than what was described. Works just fine for what I wanted it for. Great little speaker for sitting out on the porch listening to the ballgame.
5	1397260800	Now this is GREAT! the sound clear  making calls and receiving them. Nice not to have the ear piece in, able to watch a movie on my phone and hear it
5	1397088000	A friend of ours recommended this and it is absolutely great for our state  which doesn't allow holding a phone while driving. It is great/easy to set up to your phone. Very Highly recommended. Wouldn't do without.
5	1397088000	I didn't have high expectations of this unit.  I have had it several months now and am blown away by how well it works.Setup was easy and my iPhone paired very quickly.  The battery life is amazing. I am a contractor and am in my truck a lot, and in and out many times per day.  It hooks up as soon as I get in.  Once volume is set once the call sound quality is very good. The battery lasts more than a week on average.  I am very pleased with the performance of this unit and think it is a great value.  Highly recommended.
3	1397088000	Good idea, poor execution for the following reasons:1. Voice recognition is poor which makes this device frustrating to use. I do not have a foreign accent but even words like &#34;Play&#34; and &#34;Stop&#34; aren't always recognized by this device.  I've said &#34;stop&#34; and the Jabra will say &#34;calling.&#34;  Silly stuff like that.  Voice recognition on this device is lacking big time.2. Integration with the iPhone (mine is the 4S with iOS 7.1) is lacking also.  This could be due to the iOS for all I know, regardless the issues are:a. When a call comes in there is a long delay (sometimes as many as 4 rings for the calling party) before the Jabra announces the caller and probably another ring by the time it actually lets you speak &#34;Answer&#34; to pick up the call.  Some people may end up hanging up or the call may actually end up going to voicemail.b. Saying &#34;play&#34; will typically start playing music from the built-in iphone music player but if you want to play podcasts from the podcast app, good luck.  You have to manually open the app and hit play for the sound to come through the Jabra Freeway's speakers.c. Sometimes sound from the music app or any other app will not stream to the Jabra at all.  It's almost like the iphone doesn't recognize it as a sound output device.  This is either a buggy bluetooth A2DP implementation on the Jabra's part or on the iphone's part.3. FM transmitter is useless.  But this is no surprise.One positive about this device is that the sound output is loud enough when you need it to be and it appears the folks on the other end of the call can hear me clearly as well.
3	1397088000	Meh. The sound from callers is good. The FM function is spotty which was disappointing. This technology has a ways to go.
4	1397001600	I am pleased with the Jabra Freeway. It's very easy to use, the speaker is clear and easy to understand, even in heavy traffic. My only complaint is, it doesn't disconnect from the Bluetooth device until you are at least 15 feet from the unit. This means, if I leave my vehicle and walk into my house, and the phone rings, sometimes I can answer, sometimes it wants me to answer at the Jabra unit. The easy solution is, when I leave my car I (try and remember to) turn off the Jabra unit.
3	1397001600	I really liked this when I first got it. Sounds great to me (voice and music). I practiced the voice commands in home and it seemed to work fine. When I would try and do it in the car it wouldn't recognize the commands and would go back to music. Then it kept wanting me to re-pair my phone each time I got in. It was funny because I could get out and run a quick errand and it was working with my phone. Then I'd get back in and it would keep telling me to pair my device before I could play my music. I didn't want to fight with it so I just returned it.
5	1396915200	If you are looking for a hands free speaker phone, this the one you want!....My Jabra Freeway came very fast. Many reviews on other hands free speaker phones say the volume is not loud.  This one has all the volume you need and more! The volume really makes it not necessary to link up through the car radio. That is your choice if you want the car radio as your listening source. Paring for bluetooth is very easy. Clipping it to the sun visor makes it very convenient to use and hear and speak to! If your phone has the speech to text feature then that is a plus!...Basically all you have to do is turn your phone, connect up, and lay the phone down.  I recommend this one for the hands free option for driving!...
5	1396915200	this is the best blue tooth product ever... it connects to my phone effortlessly and works awesome... great sound out too.... thanks
3	1396828800	I had the Kinivo BTC8 FM transmitter in my car but then it stopped working so I got the Jabra.  Then I found that it was the Bluetooth in my phone that had stopped working, so I had to replace the phone.  The BTC8 worked just fine.Of the two products, the BTC8 is much better at FM transmission.  When tuned to 101.7, a spot on the band that has no radio transmission, the BTC8 completely takes away the hiss, so you hear the sound nice and clear.  The Jabra has a nicer sound, in my opinion, but it doesn't cut the hiss out, so the overall experience is horrible.  The BTC8 wins that category hands down.What the Jabra has that the BTC8 doesn't is its own speakers, so you can listen to the Jabra without needing to connect it to your radio.  It also has a battery, so it doesn't need to be plugged in to work, unlike the BTC8, which needs to be connected to the car's cigarette lighter.So now I have both and I use them for their strengths.  When I'm driving, I listen to the BTC8 piping the music through the radio and to the car's stereo speakers.  When I'm parked and have the engine turned off, I'll listen via the Jabra.Since the FM transmitter part of the Jabra is such a poor device, this product should be advertised as speakers that can be used during product demonstrations.  Just hook up the device to your computer and play the sound while you show a video to your customers.  In that light, the Jabra is much cheaper than other speakers.
1	1396828800	I wanted a bluetooth speakerphone because the bluetooth in my car will not work with my phone and it is illegal, in NY state, to hold your cell phone while driving.I bought this unit because of the power and my car is a little on the noisy side.This unit is useless as a hands free system because to access the hands free calling you have to use your cell phone to call into their system.  From there I am not sure how it works because what is the sense?  If I have to pick up my phone to dial their system, I might as well just make the call.I know two other people that are thinking of buying something like this.  After hearing how this unit works they are looking into other brands.  I will keep this unit because I probably will be getting another car in about 6 months and I hope that bluetooth will work with my phone.If you are looking at this because it is illegal to handle your cell phone while driving where you live... look elsewhere!!
5	1396828800	I tried couple car stereos with built-in bluetooth calling, but no one could ever hear me, only the road noise, so I tried this and works perfectly! Very easy to use and setup. Battery lasts long too, haven't even charged it since I got it.It senses when you're in the car, and when you leave the car, so it automatically turns on and off, which helps save battery life and makes it seem-less to use.I use the Jabra for bluetooth calling, and stream audio to my car's stereo. So its nice that I can be connected to the two devices at once for the different purposes with my Android phone.
2	1396742400	This item was advertised as simple to use but it has been anything but. I can turn on my phone when we get in the car and as far as answering when someone calls and speaking, it is clear with no problems. The troubles start when giving it directions as far as calling someone else, battery usage, etc. When you ask for battery usage to see how much battery is left it frequently dials someone instead. My husband cant get it to recognize or follow verbal commands. My voice it can but only sometimes not all times.  The instruction booklet gives basic information and was helpful only regarding setup, not really for troubleshooting. The few things it says you may have trouble with it gives helpful hints for but they weren't really all that helpful and didn't solve the problem. It does the basic thing I needed of letting me answer my phone and talk clearly and that's all I'm going for in the long run.
2	1396742400	Inconsistent performance; audio quality varies; manual not very helpful for problem-solving; still struggling to get it to work correctly after more than 3 weeks of use
5	1396742400	The Jabra Freeway Bluetooth Speakerphone is an excellent choice for adding bluetooth capability to an auto.  The device easily pairs with bluetooth enabled phones and is easy to use.  The speaker quality is very good and a single press of the button allows you to use your phone's voice commands.  The speakerphone clips to the visor of the car putting both the speaker and microphone close to your head.  Cost is relatively low compared to other options (such as a bluetooth enabled stereo).  All in all a very good choice for adding a safe phone system to an auto.
4	1396569600	It is ready every time I open the car door.its a great buy for anyone, I like it very much.
4	1396569600	This speakerphone has a crystal clear sound with easy to use control buttons. The pairing process worked very well. Your cell phone's capabilities will determine how well the Freeway Speakerphone will perform.
5	1396483200	Good control by voice and  useful function. I use it to control my iphone to play music/call someone/siri. i love it.
2	1396396800	In my state you can no longer use a cell phone while driving unless using a Bluetooth device.  My Samsung G3 works fine (no special setting changes) with the built-in Bluetooth on our 2006 Toyota Prius and with my Plantronics Bluetooth headset.  I needed a visor Bluetooth unit for my other car (I don't like wearing a headset while driving).  My choice came down to this Jabra Freeway unit or Motorola Roadster 2.  Everything else being equal I picked the Freeway solely on its cheaper price.  When it arrived I immediately charged it overnight before using.  The next morning it paired with the G3 without a hitch.  I put it in the car and made my first test call.  I pressed the VOICE button and it immediately dialed the 3rd party Voice Assist (888#) which asked for the name or # I wanted them to dial.  It tried several times giving it the name or # but in all cases it did nothing except say command canceled.  I turned off Voice but in doing so I couldn't use the Freeway unit to dial.  I had to dial using the phone (against the law).  Once connected I could use the Freeway to hear and talk.  Small negative is the cloth grill covering which in a car will get dusty and torn over time.  I contacted Jabra support, they suggested I update the firmware but after trying on 2 PC"s neither would recognized the Freeway and install the update.  Jabra said to return the unit which I did.  I'm ordering the Motorola Roadster 2 unit now.  I don't like having to use a 3rd party Voice Assist that costs $59/year to dial, not to mention the delay it takes making 2 calls to complete a call assuming the unit worked.  I'm giving this 2 stars because; 1) it paired easily, 2) sound was very strong and clear & 3) Jabra tech support was fairly prompt getting back within 2 days on both my emails.  I hope the rest of your have better luck because this unit has potential.
5	1396396800	This little but powerful Speakerphone does it all. Plays great music and is easy to use to get Map directions and/or to receive calls. I highly recommend it.
5	1396396800	Great sounding unit! Love the FM transmitter! Would buy again. Best Bluetooth devise I have ever used! Highly recommend !
5	1396310400	This was extremely easy to set up, and the placement on the car visor is simple.  It senses your phone, so off and on is automatic.  The voice is clear and messages come through audibly.
4	1396310400	I have one for my vehicle and loved it so much my wife now has one. The thing is so nice I use it as a speakerphone in my office for cellular calls. Very nice!
4	1396224000	Works pretty good except voice commands. After pairing with the cell phone (T-mobile Wing) this device works totally hands-free. I recommend this product.
4	1396224000	I really like this unit. It was super easy to set up and works well. Everyone can hear my voice clearly and it sounds good in the car. The only issue I have seen so far is that when I love from car to car, I had difficulty engaging with my other Bluetooth car lines. I will try again and see but other than that...pretty happy!
3	1396224000	I like this when I am driving, but everyone tells me that they can't hear me half the time that I am cutting in and out.  Good for the price, but if they can't hear me then whats the point in using it.
4	1396224000	This item works as intended.  The speaker system is great and the charge time lasts for a week at a time with my usage.  I recently upgraded vehicles and gave this item to a friend who only has rave reviews of this device.  The first flaw is the FM modulator.  This unit does not pick up FM signals for stereo output from my old car very well.  But this is offset by the quality of the internal speaker.  The second flaw we found out by mistake.  I was driving my truck which has blue tooth, and my wife was driving the car close to me as we were taking it in for service, the units blue-tooth kept stealing the signal from the truck and interrupting the conversation.  This is not a likely scenario for many people but did cause me some confusion until I figured it out.
5	1396224000	Reliable device that has good audio quality. Only thing I would warn about, is that it can pair with other devices with other devices without warning, if you do not disconnect.
5	1396137600	I purchased to upgrade my 2007 Honda Ridgeline and to get rid of  XM costs. Works as per the manual. Great hands free with great sound. Sometimes has difficulty understanding voice commands to get to my iphone 5S commands, but Siri doesn't understand direct to the phone sometimes too. That is just normal to have some miscommunication. FM transmitter works great. No humming on second station picked in a town of about 200,000. Pandora works great. Itunes/music and streaming podcast works. I'm about to take a road trip half way across the nation, so will update if I run into problems going long distance.
5	1396137600	I've had numerous Bluetooth speakers for the car. and NONE worked as well as this.  Voice quality is excellent (good enough even to play books, not just converse).  Given the amounts I have spent on inferior units, this is a bargain.  Especially helpful is the outstanding standby time provided by the battery, and best of all, the automatic on and off when the unit detects that you (or more precisely your phone) have/has entered or left the car.  This is the one to get.
5	1396051200	this item rocks!!! IT is loud enough and sinc's up instantly. It has an awesome battery life as well. Don't buy anything else!
5	1396051200	It does just what it is supposed to do. Sound is excellent and it goes on and off automatically. It serves my wife's purposes better than the Cruise she had previously.  She would often not be able to talk on her phone after exiting her vehicle. She would still be connected to her blue tooth and not be in her car (in the garage)but the range of the device was diverting her call to her car instead of letting her use her phone in the house.  She could have physically turned it off, but just another thing to do every time you get out of the car.  Motion detector turns it on and off and works well. Thanks...
1	1396051200	The wife said that it allowed to much road noise to hear properly & understand my part of the conversation.
5	1396051200	Both products are excellent and I've thoroughly tested them on the road in quiet and noisy road conditions. First...  The Motorola is slightly better using the FM mode (using the car radio and speakers) it picks a station and stays on unless you manually press the + for search. Easy to program per station.  It always goes into sleep mode should you leave the car and reactivates itself once your phone comes within 20 feet or so.  I use an I Phone at the moment. It also announces your phone name so if your name is Robert it will say &#34;Roberts I Phone connected&#34;The downfall on the Roadster is its speaker.  It's has one single speaker and the sound quality is OK. Fine if you're just calling friends or family but for business calls (I'm in sales) it comes across a little distorted on the other end so I've been told.If buy this product, use the car speakers in FM mode much better, clearer too.The Jabra has excellent speaker sound actually really good. It's also comes with FM mode which works very well too but, if you power the product down while in the car, it's loses the programmed station and you have to rescan. Not big deal but why doesn't it store the last station?The Jabra is very light in weight but much larger than the Roadster 2. About the same size as a GPS but its seek in design and feel, very trendy.Charging the Jabra is easy but I hate that the red light is behind the webbing material. It's hard to see if the product is fully charge though you can ask battery level.If I was trying to choose I would go with the Jabra. You won't be disappointed...
5	1395964800	Great product Jabra Freeway works great. One year of voice assist you get with purchase of Jabra does not work with iphone called Tech. support for voice assist help could not help me . Do not waste your time to download Voice assist app.Every time I call they say that they are having problems with the App.
5	1395964800	Works great with my phones and car, quick delivery and a great unit for any car, unit charges quickly too
1	1395964800	I sent this back because the FM transmitter did not work. Besides that it's great... but the sound sucks. Too much static. Buy the little wire that hooks up to your tape deck instead. Don't buy this. Waste of $. Doesn't work unless you want to listen to it's crappy speaker. Returned it a day after I bought it.
5	1395878400	I have had this for about three months now and must say it is better than I expected. Works great with the iPhone. I drive a conversion van and have it on the drivers visor. It uses motion sensing and as I climb in the van it says &#34;connected&#34;. I hold the talk button down for 2 or 3 seconds and Siri comes on. Works Great. Answering a call push talk, hang up push talk. My van has terrible radio so the FM doesn't work very well but I could care less.  If just works great, and at this price you can't go wrong. Buy it you won't regret it....
1	1395878400	Jabra is awesome, HOWEVER, when it came with a free subscription to VoiceAssist - every time I made a phone call I would get 8 messages requesting permission to access my contact data for Voice Assist.  I did NOT want Voice Assist.  I tried numerous times asking Voice Assist to stop the requests.  I called Jabra and they told me it was a separate company and could not help me - even if it meant I would have to return the device - which I have done.  Unbelievable lack of assistance with both companies.  :(
5	1395792000	such an improvement over other Bluetooth devices I have used for taking and making phone calls in the vehicle.  easy set up, great clarity and you can even set it up to read your emails to you.  very satisfied with it.
5	1395792000	Clamped to the visor with on and off buttons very handy, it has turned out to be a real asset while driving. I highly recommend it.
4	1395705600	great sound battery lasts a long time. fits nicely on my sun visor. only problem is the phone keeps ringing every time I get in the car which means I have to answer my phone and push the yes button to reconnect to jabra. There has to be abetter way.
3	1395705600	Warning for those with a Mustang GT, (2006) our cars are just too loud. On the surface streets it's fine but once on the highway a bone stock Mustang GT is far too loud, you can't hear the callers.. On the surface streets I give the unit 4 stars. The problem is the radio function doesn't work, at all! For double the price you can buy a nice Alpine/Pioneer/JVC etc head unit and solve the problem permanently.
5	1395532800	I used it to upgrade a 2007 Mustang convertible. It acts as a hands free and to stream music and calls through the on board sound system.It did struggle with voice commands due to the noise of the Mustang particularly with the roof off, but that's to be expected.  Everything else works as described.  I use it constantly and get about 2 weeks out if a charge.  On long runs about 12 hours constant use playing music is about right.Update.  Moved this to a Mercedes SL and it's now virtually perfect.  Voice commands work well, and it even passes Siri instructions without problem.The only issue is it's unable to deal with my English accent.  To find out how much charge there is left I have to say 'baddery' rather than 'battery'!
1	1395532800	sorry to tell but the Jabra works very bad!!! full of noises and cannot be heard properly.i asked amazon to send my dissapointment to the seller and untill today-4 month later- never got any answer.i will not recommend this Jabra! i paid 114$ and go bad item!!!
1	1395446400	I can hear very clear on my end but those I call constantly complain of broken up words and only hearing part of what I say.
1	1395360000	Audio barely audible over road noise, FM range only 2 feet. When on my visor it's signal does not reach rear window antenna.
4	1395273600	I did not realize that I would have to upgrade my cell phone (to a smart phone) to access my phone directory.  however I still would have ordered it as it is easy to use and the sound is clear as a bell.  I love it !
5	1395187200	I think it is good. But sometime it could not recognize my voice command. Maybe it is set for some accent. But it is still convenience when I use it during driving.
1	1395187200	Would consistently misunderstand and dial a random phone entry.  Tried Phone Home multiple times and sometimes it would phone correctly but often it tried to call another entry.  Also wouldn't understand "Phone Commands" multiple times.Edit Update:  After checking further it may not be totally the devices fault, using an iphone4 it maybe the phone itself [...]
5	1395100800	Since Illinois went hands free while driving, this little Jabra has been able to take all my calls, make all my calls and keep me up on my texts, without hazarding a ticket! Easy to install and easy to use -- I recommend it to all my friends and family.
4	1395100800	Effortless paring with an Iphone. But when I tried to get it to pare with my GF's Samsung Galaxy, nope. Never.
2	1395014400	I was excited to receive this first-class device and quickly paired it with my phone.  The pairing process could not have been easier.  I turned it on and the speakerphone told me exactly what to do.  I was up and running in less than 2 minutes.The device is very sleek and the speakerphone is loud and very clear.  I also liked the ability to pair with my fm radio and create a 'surround sound' speakerphone experience.The only problem, and it's a big one, is that sometimes when I first pickup a call the caller says it sounds like I'm a computer, very robotic.  Now, I've never been called overly dramatic, but would like to think that my voice doesn't sound digitized like Max Hedroom. When I disconnect and reconnect my phone from the bluetooth device, the problem resolves.  I'm now hoping that I have a faulty device because when it works, it's awesome.  I will however have a hard time using it and being constantly concerned if the caller was one of the lucky ones who are hearing me clearly or in my Max Hedroom voice.
5	1395014400	It was very easy to set up and works like a charm.  I also like it that the power cable is USB and therefore can work with other power supplies, so I don't have to keep switching the cigaret lighter power supply.
4	1394928000	Received product as described; clear voice, informs me whom is calling, easy to use; I have an old car & it is nice having  capability of hands free
5	1394841600	BOUGHT IT FOR MY GRANDSON BECAUSE OF THE NEW ILLINOIS LAW OUTLAWING DRIVING WITH A PHONE IN YOUR HAND. HE LOVES IT.
5	1394841600	This works very well with my iPhone 5s, sync took a second to figure out in the car since I didn't have the manual with me when I sync'd the first time. Hooking up to the radio via FM radio is a pretty cool feature too, but it seems to drain the battery a bit faster, not positive though.
5	1394841600	This is a great way to be able to speak with people in the car with no manipulations necessary. works well.
5	1394755200	I have been using this for about 2 weeks and it works great. Sound is good, but receiver can hear me clearly through loud traffic. Definitely recommend it.
5	1394755200	Works great with iphone using voice commands and can access my contact list through Siri.  It sounds clear with no static and was so easy to set up and use.  It will play music,  answer your phone, make calls, read texts - it's a great hands free option.
4	1394755200	I have owned this unit a few weeks and have used the speakerphone on several occasions.  People I talk to have said that the unit does a nice job canceling out road noise, and say I'm easy to hear and understand.  On my end, the unit sounds clear and has plenty of volume, although my car is fairly quiet (2005 Toyota Camry).  There are times, however, when the unit acts like a classic speakerphone and mutes or clips the first part of what you say, especially if you start talking before the other person stops talking.  This is only a problem for fast paced, impatient conversations, and is how every speakerphone (incuding ones in the office) has worked that I've ever used.  The unit works best if each person waits for the other to stop talking, then begins talking themselves.The only technical glitch I've had so far is with bluetooth connectivity with my iPhone 4.  The unit shuts itself off in the absence of a bluetooth signal, so I leave it powered on all the time.  The battery life is excellent.  However, sometimes when I re-enter the car, the unit and my phone don't automatically reconnect.  Happens around 30%-40% of the time.  When that happens, I either power the unit off and back on, or toggle the bluetooth on my phone off and back on.  One or both actions seem to make things reconnect.  The rest of the time the unit and my phone connect as soon as I get in or near the car.I have not used the FM transmitter, and I have not listened to music or podcasts through the unit to more thoroughly test the sound quality.This is my first bluetooth car speakerphone, so I don't have experience with other equipment to compare this to.  Overall I'm pleased with the unit and would probably purchase it again.
5	1394755200	Since my hearing isn't as acute as it once was, I needed more clarity on my 'phone, especially if there is any background noise present which is always the case when in the car.  The Jabra Freeway solved that problem plus giving me hands free operation.
4	1394668800	I got this to replace my Motorola Roadster 2. The Roadster 2 feature set is exactly what I wanted, and that's why I've been slow to upgrade, but the sound quality was just barely passable, so I finally caved. The Freeway has a much improved noise cancellation feature and the speaker sounds worlds better than my old Roadster 2, so I'm pretty happy with it.My only qualm is that I wish I could turn off VoiceAssist. When I push the voice button, I have to wait for the &#34;say a command&#34; prompt and say &#34;phone commands&#34; to get to Siri. I would prefer to go straight to Siri. When I forget to say &#34;phone commands&#34; first, the Freeway automatically dials out to VoiceAssist to complete the command. Since I've never signed up for VoiceAssist, nothing worthwhile would happen if I let the call go through, but the Freeway still tries to make it happen. I then have to end the unwanted call and try again. Overall, I find the sound quality makes up for this occasional irritation, and I've found that I can just press the Home button on my iPhone to get Siri's attention and still talk to &#34;her&#34; through the Freeway, so with some user re-education it will work out OK.
5	1394668800	My husband loves this for his job.  Loves that it can transmit through the speakers.  Haven't had a problem yet!
5	1394668800	IT does everything it needs to flawlessly!!! I hooked up two phones (Droid Bionic-Blackberry) in about 20 seconds!Both phones work seamlessly for me... no more tickets for me!
5	1394668800	the bluetooth range is small so if I leave it on, it is not connecting to my phone when I am 20 feet away. I can leave this on and it will not take over my call until I am at the car.unlike my other Jabra speakerphone, this one is loud enough to actually work at freeway speeds.FINALLY, something that works very well
2	1394668800	Save your money! Jabra does not recognize the simple voice commands that are suppose to make it operate hands free.
1	1394582400	UPDATE. ELECTRONICS WILL FAIL, CUSTOMER SERVICE MUST NOT!!im sorry to say this, but Jabra customer service is s***. I purchased a couple of Jabra Bluetooth ear pcs. been a LOYAL customer for ten years . One failed. Would not charge. I called customer service. They couldn't have been nicer. "NO PROBLEM, JUST SEND US PROOF OF PURCHASE. WE WILL SEND NEW ONE, EVEN THOUGH IT IS KNOW OUT OF PRODUCTION.so I did. Emailed everything they asked for in detail. I RECEIVE AN EMAIL , STATING OUT OF THEIR 1000'S OF RETAILERS THEY DONT RECONGNIZE recognize the seller. it came to in a sealed box , obviously never opened. in 4 different emails to me Jabra made excuse after excuse. Elevating the excuses in each email. to the point they were claiming it must not be new, it was now out of production( on the fon they said it was not a problem). Jabra did not want the broken one, from sealed package. I offered to send to them, on my dime.  Refused. Then they started telling me, the policies I was quoted over fon, were not valid. Wow how convenient for them.NEVER PURCHASE A JABRA PRODUCT. CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL BLATANTLY LIE.NEVER LOOK AT A JABRA PRODUCT.IM GOING TO VIDEO OG ME SMASHING THE PRODUCT, AND POST ON UTUBE.
5	1394582400	We have three of them. We use it with our iPhones. People on the other end say our voices are clear. The FM options does work but it does get static from time to time. You have to pick a good clear channel first.
5	1394496000	It woks just perfect. The sound is very clear. Easy for setting up and helps a lot on traffic jam. Cheaper than a Bluetooth that comes with the vehicle.
2	1394496000	This device have problems understanding voice commands. I tell it to call a person from my cellphone contacts and it plays music every time. I've tried everything to resolve the issue, but still have the problem. It doesn't put out good sound quality for listening to music in your car (Car stereo is much better). However, talking to someone on the phone is very good. I can hear them very clearly. Also, on the receiving end they have no idea you are talking to them from an external device. With that said, I give it a two(2) star rating..
5	1394409600	Needed a hands free device to comply with new laws.  I find this easy to use and clear.  Works great with iPhone/Siri, I ended up not activating their first year free software and I am just using Siri.I have recommended to others already.
5	1394323200	I purchased three of these Freeway Speakerphones.  In my state it is illegal to use a cell phone while driving unless it's hands free.  That's why I purchased these units.  After researching several available handsfree speakerphones I chose the Jabra Freeway unit.  First I purchased one unit and used it for 30 days.  It works very well.  The audio is clear both directions.  It is easy to acclimate to this unit.  Easy to set up.  Everything about it is easy to understand.  My wife likes the fact that it tells you when you are connected as you get into the vehicle.  It's a reminder for her that the phone is with her in the purse, pocket, tote, whatever...and she doesn't need the phone in her hand to answer incoming calls, she just speaks to the Freeway.  She loves it!Since my main use is hands free voice communications I chose not to subscribe to the voice command dialing option.  The first year is free, but I chose not to use it as it uses cell phone plan minutes.  Another option I don't use is the Music via the FM radio.  Some purchasers didn't feel that part of the Freeway worked very well, but it's not a option I wanted.The Freeway works very well for my family.  We have three units in use now.The only down side to the handsfree unit is that if several people are in the vehicle and you use it...everyone in the vehicle will hear the call.  That hasn't been a problem for us, just wanted to point it out.The Jabra Freeway will connect with two separate phones.  If your phone has Blue tooth capabilities it well work.  Takes like three minutes to connect and start using it.I would purchase another unit in a heartbeat if the need arrives.  Our family likes it a lot!
4	1394323200	The Jabra works well. My biggest complaint would be the fact that the speech recognition does not understand my voice most of the time.
2	1394323200	In general I like Jabra products and I thought I researched this pretty well. I was disappointed. First, let me state that I bought this to use in rather noisy vehicle. We use it in an 1998 S10 Blazer ZR2. The vehicle has a lot of noise when driving. The background noise that the speakerphone picks up makes calls very difficult. When we first got the product we tried it around the house and it sounded very good. In the car where it matters it is extremely poor. If you drive a very quiet car or truck you may find it adequate.The unit looks good and has a quality feel to it which I find to be common to most Jabra products. The first thing to greet me when opening the packaging is an offer to a $59.00 per year subscription to &#34;Voice Assist&#34; , which is a third party voice dialing app. In order for you to voice dial from the Jabra Freeway, you need some sort of additional app. I admit that Jabra doesn't claim in their advertising that the unit supports voice dial. What they do say is that it will pair your bluetooth device using voice command.The only work around that I was able to come up with is to set up voice dial on our Samsung S4 Active and then go thru the Jabra to talk to the phone. It seems to work out but I think it is a far cry from what most people think they are buying when they purchase one of these. I can guarantee you that I would not have purchased this product if I thought they were going to sell me a subscription to be able to be truly &#34; hands free&#34;.
4	1394323200	I like the Freeway in general. My only complaint is the low volume. In many situations it is very difficult to hear the caller.
4	1394236800	Works good. Good instructions. Get a lot for the money. I'm glad I am able to go on line with Amazon and get this.
5	1394236800	Love the Jabra, they've always made great products. Buying this was a no-brainer. Has plenty of audio output, and the battery lasts for a long long long time. Actually, 13hrs though that is freakin' forever.
5	1394236800	This order was a gift and the quality is very great! Thank. You very much for the Bluetooth. Satisfied customer.
4	1394236800	For most part people I call, they don't have any major problems with the communication.  Sometimes there are sharp noises I have to turn the volume 1 level or two down.  I listened to it through my voicemail, it isn't as clear as I speak directly through my iPhone.  I live in a big city and every few frequency there is a radio station therefore I can't play music from my iPhone onto my radio.  But I don't have a problem listening to its speakers at all.  I sometimes use the device to get info out of Siri.  It works well with my iPhone.  I'm just glad to be able to speak without using my hands (except pressing it to speak).  I try not to use the phone period when I'm on the roads but that isn't possible.  I recommend it!
3	1394236800	This unit seems to have a sound level issue...Cannot get the level to its highest level of sound. I have had this same unit in the past ...had it not been stolen I would still be using it.
4	1394236800	We purchased 3 of these units in my family.  I read the reviews and it sounded like a good product.  Of the 3 units I sent one back for replacement as it just quit working,  Received a replacement right away and have had no problems with this one.  I'm told this one is clearer than the one I had problems with from the people I have had phone conversations with using it.  The other two units have had no problems.  The one complaint I have is the Voice Assist is very tempermental and you really have to speak slow and clear for it to work.  My elderly parents can't use the voice assist and it doesn't understand them.  However I can say a command into their device and it works fine.  Other than those few issues I would definelty recommend this product.
1	1394150400	Bluetooth issues world for a while but disconnects a lot and doesn't stream music very well. Piece of junk don't buy.
1	1393977600	I found this item pathetic, returned it after first trip in the car.1) It would frequently lose bluetooth connection to my phone and attempt to re-pair2) There is no phone book within the device, it relies on the phone's built-in voice features3) ...which don't appear to work with the bluetooth (might be a restriction of my Galaxy Nexus)4) Because of that, saying &#34;Call&#34; does nothing but redial.5) The &#34;Play&#34; command does not search the phone for music, but rather just turns on the player... without any way to turn it off
4	1393977600	I move it to whatever car or truck I am in. Amazing interface with Siri. It would have 5 stars if the AM worked better. I end up not using that function because it is clearer on the unit.
1	1393977600	Horrible voice recognition, I say &#34;dial home&#34; it dials my Mom or says try again, I say &#34;dial Tom&#34; and it dials someone else. The regular voice is SO LOUD!!! Its scares people in the car and my wife screams at me to turn it down  which I cannot do. This thing is going to get me killed on the freeway trying to make a call. Buy somehting else.
5	1393977600	recommend this for anyone needing a bluetooth10 stars just get it and use it .....voice assit comes free for a year another plusrecommend it to your friends...
5	1393891200	I have been looking for a good Bluetooth for my car and this is it.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to make your drive safer.
1	1393804800	I have had other Jabra products which worked well and was disappointed to see the Jabra brand tarnished by this junk.  The concept is brilliant but the unit itself is garbage that worked for only a short while.  Basically, it has a system for turning the unit on and off automatically when you enter and leave the vehicle.  It worked fine for  about 2 months.  Then it began turning itself on and off continuously while driving to the point that it was impossible to use.  Don't waste your money.The FM function also is garbage as it did not work properly from the beginning and the static and sound quality are unacceptable.  The voice quality for the call function is good but as noted above, I couldn't use it for calls once it began turning itself on and off continuously every several seconds.Don't waste your money.I was influenced to buy this because I have a Jabra Pro wireless headset that I use with an HD phone and also with voice recognition software which works flawlessly.  Jabra should reengineer the Freeway or discontinue it to avoid damaging its brand.
4	1393804800	I bought the Jabra for my fiance so that he would stop playing around with his cell phone while he's driving. The only thing I noticed was a little bit of lag time with verbal commands. Other than that, it works well as a speakerphone for calls. I haven't tested it for any other function.
3	1393804800	Would like more volume and the FM doesn't work in the Chicago area (too many stations that interfere and cause static with the Jabra)
5	1393718400	Our car wasn'ty equiped for bluetooth whtn the new law on handsfree came out. So this was awesome to find on Amazon. Much less expensive than the phone store for the exact same item. Plus my wonderson gifted us with a gift \card for use on amazon. so what a perfect deal for us. just added a little cash  and in business.
5	1393718400	In IL we have to have hands free. Wasn't sure how this would work out and after seeing another friend use it, had to buy it. I get in my car and it links without issue. Would recommend for the perfect hands free.
1	1393632000	It supposed to be the best speakerphone, but actually people hardly hear me, and hear echo even when I reduce the volume.Besides the volume buttons reacts strangely (pressing once on Vol + and from too quite it becomes to loud.The only good thing is that when I direct music to it, it sounds good.But as speakerphone for conversations it's awful!!
1	1393632000	Yes, the features are numerous and ambitious, but the sound quality is not there.  The battery does last, and the auto-connection does work.  Where this unit falls apart is from the responses you will hear from the other end of the call.  Almost everyone complains about the echos and incoherent discussion.  The sound from them through the Jabra is fine, but every volume adjustment and phone placement change doesn't improve it.  Also, when in the car during a cold night in the teens, the speakers are completely distorted until the vehicle warms up.  This week, it decided to completely loose audio, so off to the trash can and I'm going to try another brand.  I use a Motorola Razor M if that makes any difference which brands may work better or worse with this unit.
5	1393545600	Does everything I expect and more. Bought this one for my wife and going to get one of my own too.
4	1393545600	I like this bluetooth speaker. My wife uses it a lot. My only thing with it is with the voice thing. Sometimes it knows what your saying and sometimes it does not. but we dont use that very much but for picking up the phone. But over all better than other headsets out there!
1	1393459200	The reviews on this product were fantastic.  Not true.  I recently purchased and have NEVER written a review.  This product is so bad, I had to write one.  1st call - great - connects seamlessly and that is nice.  Comment from my first victim? - It sounds like you are in a hailstorm.  It was a nice cool crisp winter day and I was stopped at a stoplight - NO ROAD NOISE.  Not one call has gone well since - I am returning this product.  Dont waste your time - Jabra has not figured the technology out yet.  Look at Plantronics - they make great products.
3	1393372800	I bought it 2 months ago and I still haven't been able to make it work as it is suppose to.  I am not sure if it is because I also have a new phone and I am not syincing them the right way.  One thing is for sure, I can answer calls in my car and they sound loud and clear.
4	1393372800	Work very well.My only complaint is the audio is a bit weak. Being very tall my seat is pushed back all the way, so the visor and speaker are as well. Should work great if you are not tall or have long legs.
5	1393286400	Have had this in my truck for a couple of months now.  Easy to setup.  I have only charged it twice in the last couple of months and I don't turn it off when I exit the truck.  It turns on as soon as I open the door to the truck.  Sounds great and plays through the FM beautifully.  I had low expectations for the FM but was greatly surprised by clarity and sound quality.  I have an apps iphone5 & 5c.  They both hookup when the wife is in the truck with hers and no manipulation required.  I highly recommend this product.
5	1392940800	I went thru alot of reviews since I will be on the road alot in my new job, so I need a bluetooth speaker that is handsfree. I really have doubt about how handsfree things can be. then I came across this Jabra Freeway. I am sceptic but when I start using the item, this total blew me away. From answering the call with just saying &#34;Answer&#34; to motion sensor detecting your presence in the car. Imagine this scenario, I left my cell phone in the car & went to attend to some business for 2 hours. Then when I went back into the car to drive away, the speaker said &#34;Connected&#34;. It doesn't waste battery when you are not in the car but the handphone is still in it. If there are no movement, the bluetooth speaker turns off by itself. The standby hours is too underrated. It should be longer. I have used it for the past week or so & it still doesn't need a charge. It should be the number of hours you are in the car. It is incredible & you should be amaze by it too.The sound quality is great & we enjoy talking while I am driving & it is not affecting me in any way..So Get it now & be amazed...:)
4	1392940800	pretty good wish it was a little louder but alot better than my last motorolla one was would buy again handy
1	1392940800	Absolutely the most worthless product I have ever purchased.  Never really performed as advertised and in less than 90 days does not work at all.
1	1392768000	I bought this because it had auto power on. I have had bad experience with Jabra products in the past, but the reviews seemed good so I took a chance.The voice functions are unusable.I have an ordinary voice, no impediments. I am a singer and a public speaker. I have a neutral mid-west American accent.Indoors, with the device sitting in front of me on the desk, it understood what I said about 75% of the time.But in the car, sitting still in the garage, it couldn't understand one single word I said.I tried speaking as &#34;normally&#34; as possible. That failing, I tried various combinations of speaking loudly, softly, enunciating more, enunciating less, shouting, cursing - nothing.And the default response is &#34;redial&#34;, which I think is a very poor default response. Any time the device doesn't understand you, it defaults to &#34;redial&#34;.So I say &#34;Battery&#34;, device says &#34;redial&#34; (and starts the phone redialing)I say &#34;What can I say?&#34;, device says &#34;redial&#34;&#34;Phone commands&#34;, &#34;redial&#34;.Redial isn't the only response, sometimes it says &#34;pairing&#34;. Every now and then it goes through a 30-second list of what words it recognizes (not), during which time it will not respond to voice at all. Sometimes it says &#34;could you say that again&#34;, but usually it takes some incorrect action.So, to me, it's garbage. Totally not ready for prime time. I see there are others here whom it does understand. The trick then is to find one of these in a store somewhere before you buy it, in order to determine whether yours is one of the voices it can understand. Because now I have to pay shipping for a product that is completely useless.
4	1392768000	Pros:  It works.  It's loud.  It's a quality product.Cons:  Voice button is worthless to me due to subscription requirement.  No aux out.  It's difficult to find a completely dead FM channel in my area, so the FM modulator doesn't work very well for me.Would I buy it again:  I plan to.  One for my wife, and one for each of my parents who travel a lot.
4	1392681600	It works well, I would recommend it to others. In fact I'm ordering another one for my second vehicle as I'm typing this.
5	1392595200	It has great hands free options and is easy to use. The comands are unique and my phone works well with it.
5	1392595200	Reception is crystal clear. Battery life is good. When talking, the person on the other end usually doesn't realize that I am using a speaker phone. Very happy with my purchase. Also, the delivery was much quicker than what was estimated.
3	1392595200	This is our 2nd purchase of the Jabra Bluetooth.  We returned the first for lack of good instructions.  Our latest purchase of the upgraded Jabra shows no improvement.  This is a new concept for we seniors, and need more explicit directions.
5	1392508800	Best item I ever bought, works great, never had a problem with it.  Allot better than having the ear piece.
5	1392508800	I have a car that does not have built in Bluetooth or satellite radio.  My work commute is very long (45 min to and hour each way), and I like to make calls while I drive.  The Jabra FREEWAY allows me to talk to family and friends while I drive without holding a phone to my ear.  No one complains about the quality of my calls.  In fact, when I ask if anyone can tell if I am using a Bluetooth the response is always &#34;No&#34;.  I use the FM transmitter to have my calls go through the radio.  I can hear my calls clearly.  It is also nice to be able to stream Pandora through my radio speakers so I don't need to search for radio stations on longer trips.  This is a great product and an inexpensive alternative to installing a stereo system that might meet the same need.
1	1392422400	Materials quality is very nice, and voice-prompted pairing was easy.  It's all downhill from there.  Voice recognition (to do the most basic commands) is absolutely terrible.  I'm a native English speaker with a neutral American accent, and I have to shout into the thing to get it to work.  Even then it dials the wrong number half the time.  Randomly says the phone call has ended when it hasn't, it's still active on the phone.  Sending it back...
5	1392336000	So very easy to sync to my cell phone. Its loud and clear.  Love the fact that I can just say &#34;answer&#34; or &#34;reject&#34; when a call comes in.  That truly is hands free.  The FM works great...music comes thru the radio and sounds wonderful.  The GPS on my cell also works great.  I do have to say, however, the &#34;surround sound&#34; in the speakerphone isn't very good.  But the FM takes care of that. Wish tho that it was truly hands free.  To play your music, make a call etc you must look up and touch the voice control button and tell it what you want it to do which to me isn't hands free.  But I still am glad I bought it.  Love the Amazon Prime....free two day shipping...and it is awesome to get something so quickly!
2	1392249600	Have had this product since January 21.2014 still haven't used it. Charging cord that came with it doesn't fit. Have talked with Jabra support twice now and I'm still waiting for a new cable.
1	1392249600	It is very difficult to transmit commands to the point of giving up!  Save you money, look for a headset.
5	1392163200	After trying numerous bluetooth speaker phones, I have finally found one that actually works. Friends had said that my other bluetooths sounded like I was in a bucket and there was a lot of background noise. The Jabra also can play music through your phone device either through its speaker or via the radio. The only problem with playing it through the radio is that there seems to be  more static than with other bluetooths. Despite this, I will sacrifice the static for a better sounding speaker phone for a hands-free phone call. The Jabra far exceeds all of the others. I would strongly recommend it.
5	1392163200	Use this almost everyday, holds a great charge. You can also connect it through the radio, which I love so I can play my music from my phone and comes out sounding great from my car speakers
5	1392076800	It's very versatile. Not only does it provide hands free phone service but also the ability to link my phone to my car radio to play my music over my car stereo
3	1392076800	I expected more from Jabra.  Freeway it's only a good speaker and microphone for your car.  You can hear and be heard without problems but voice commands not always work.  You may missed some calls if you insist on using voice command to answer it.  In practice, it's more secure to press the buttons.  The FM transmitter is useless on urban areas.
1	1391990400	This product did not work as advertised.  You can barely hear as the volume is so low.  When calling tech support to help, they tried but simply gave up and said that is as loud as it will get.  Now trying to return it, it is past the window for return so am stuck with a poor product.
5	1391990400	The Jabra works great with two cell phones hooked up to it. It is used in a state where hands free is required.
4	1391990400	Worked well with my wife's Smasung Galaxy phone.  All voice commands and features work well.  Good clear voice from the caller and her calls are very clear from the device.  I can actually hear better with this speakerphone than I can directly from the ear piece on the phone.  Only works for out going calls when paired to an LG Cosmos.  Incoming calls causes the phone to shut down and reboot.
5	1391904000	Really like to automatic power on when I get in my car and it works really well as a speaker for my phones GPS system.
5	1391904000	Works great, very clear, stays charged for a long time before I need to charge it again. Connects automatically as soon as I (and my phone) get in the car - to be honest, connects when I put something in the trunk too!Not using the free membership it comes with - tried it, thought it was pointless.I used this with the voice control from my iPhone, have it on my visor, tell it to call X, end call, play music etc, works very well.Highly recommended to anyone who commutes in traffic in the DC area!
5	1391904000	This device is amazing. It is easy to hear others, easy to pair and flawlessly pairs automatically with both of my devices as soon as I open the door. The battery in mine last for about 2-3 weeks without a charge depending on usage.
1	1391817600	First of all, don't buy this piece of junk! I bought it so that I can get rid of my ear-bud, which it does. However, the device does not recognize voice commands and does not work with my FM receiver. I only use this as a replacement for my ear-bud. Other than that, it useless. Stay the hell away from this junk; you've been warned.
2	1391817600	AFTER READING INFO ON JABRA FREEWAY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE ANSWER TO TALKING ON MY CELL PHONE WHILE DRIVINGUNDER ILLINOIS' NEW BAN ON CELL PHONE USAGE WHILE DRIVING.  ONLY A BRIEF SUMMARY ON HOW TO USE THE DEVICE CAME WITH IT.  (I NEED JABRA INSTRUCTIONS FOR DUMMIES.);  HAVING DIFFICULTY DOWNLOADING THE 26 PAGE OPERATING MANUAL; JABRA DISCONNECTS CALL BEFORE IT TELLS YOU WHO IS CALLING SO YOU CAN SAY &#34;ANSWER&#34;;  JABRA SPEAKS DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THAN I BECAUSE WHEN I GIVE A NAME TO CALL IT CALLS SOMEONE ELSE.  THINKING ABOUT RETURNING DEVICE.
4	1391644800	ProsConnects easily to phoneAnnounces callers nameGood call qualityBattery lasts a long timeThe clip works well and holds it in place nicelyEasy to answer/hang up with the large buttonConsI can not get it to recognize my voice to check the battery level (which is the only way to check the battery) - it always asks me to say it againThe volume is not nearly loud enough - I have it maxed and it is hard to hear the other person's voice on the speaker when I'm in the car with road noise. It's good quality, just not loud enough.
4	1391644800	I drive a stick shift and there is absolutely no way to use a phone safely so I did some research and bought this.  Instantly recognized, works great with Siri.  I take away 1-star for the FM Transmitter-- not really strong enough and when I used it, the person on the other end wasn't able to hear me.  Switched back to just using the built-in speaker and the sound quality is great on both ends.With 1 button push, you can access any iPhone commands by voice-- I dial and text by voice with this.
5	1391644800	If you live in Illinois this is the device you must get.  Easy to use for us non geek older people who just want to push one button. I should have got this along time ago.  I noticed the local state police and truck drivers had this model. great choice.  Highly suggest it even as a gift.
5	1391558400	I have used several car speakerphones, and this one is the best, hands down.  The 3 speakers produce clear sound and perfectly understandable phone conversations.  The dual microphones pick up voice and squelch background noise remarkably.  I used to receive complaints that those I called could not understand me with another speakerphone: those complaints vanished when I purchased the Jabra Freeway.Look no further for the best bluetooth speakerphone for iPhone 5/5s.
1	1391558400	Bought this from alwayz-on-sale.  WARNING:  DO NOT BUY FROM this seller alwayz-on-saleThe FM transmitter is junk.  Totally weak, completely unusable.  I tried all the FAQs, worked with Jabra support in an attempt to not have to return this.Perhaps I had a defective unit?  Either way alwayz-on-sale refused to accept the return.  So now I am stuck with a 90 dollar piece of junk.  Completely worthless for me personally.Avoid alwayz-on-sale
4	1391472000	This was a good product.Pros: it's has a low learning curve.Cons: it doesn't always pic the best channel to play your calls on.
5	1391385600	Works as advertised.  Great battery life.  No more tickets for me!  The best feature is how it connect automatically.  Holla back at ya!!
5	1391385600	This unit is wonderful! The Bluetooth works great! The sensor that turns the unit on when you get in the vehicle works great! The link to the radio is kind of frustrating. That is because there are radio stations on every frequency I try to use! Other than that the unit is wonderful!
5	1391385600	It does offer connectivity to two devices, but it really favors the first one paired. The speaker is clear and loud enough for the driver to hear GPS directions from Google Maps while everyone in the vehicle is enjoying music from the stereo.
3	1391299200	difficult to use voice dailing.  rarely understands the command.  I'm not sure if there is a phone setting problem I should take care of (Galaxy 4) or if the device just has that problem
5	1391212800	This is the best in car speaker system ever! My car doesn't have Bluetooth so this allows me to clearly utilize Siri on my iPhone for voice navigation, music from my iPod, texting, and making/receiving calls!
1	1391126400	I got this to replace my trusty Motorola T305 that worked like a champ, but I wanted to get something new to be able to access more features on my phone.  After a month of using this thing I have almost tossed it out the window many times.  First up, after lots of research, one of the main reasons I got this was for the &#34;phone commands&#34; functions.  Well, to be very clear, when you say &#34;phone commands&#34;, it does NOT link to the phone &#34;commands&#34; on your phone (like SIRI, or Google Now), all it does i link to the &#34;voice dialing&#34; feature on your phone.  My old T305 did that!  I think the advertising and descriptions are very misleading in this regard.  Sure, there is the third party &#34;voice assist&#34; service, but its only free for a year, then its $70 every year.  Why should I have to pay for something that my phone already does, like SIRI or GN?  Besides, I tried the &#34;voice assist &#34; trial and it is terrible, takes forever to dial the number, authenticate your account, then enter into &#34;voice assist&#34; mode.  Terrible.Then, 75% of the time when I hit the &#34;Voice&#34; button, the unit disconnects Bluetooth and goes into pairing mode.  Now while I am driving I have to re-pair the unit, which requires you to take your eyes off the road, or wait and re-pair it again, for the third time in one day!  Not good.  The times when it works correctly and I say &#34;phone commands&#34;, it takes forever to hand-shake with my phone and bring up the voice dialing feature.  With my T305 that was nearly instant.  Lastly, no matter what I do, whenever the unit finally does pass the command to my voice dialing, the volume is super-duper low, and I have to re-adjust it every time.All I wanted was a true hands free Bluetooth unit to allow me to access all the great commands already on my phone like hands free texting, email etc., but this unit will not do that, period.  And its so slow adn unreliable. I tried it with my HTC One android, and my daughter&#8217;s iPhone 5, and my wives blackberry Z10.  It works terrible with all of them.  And my wife says the sound quality was no better than my T305, which cost me $30 four years ago.  I'm going back to it.It's possible that I got a bad unit, but I have seen the same issues I experienced reported in other reviews. The only good thing I found with this was the auto on/off feature.  That was cool and worked like a champ.  Other than that, don&#8217;t buy this.
5	1391040000	Jabra FEEWAY is working just great; love it.  I installed it in my MX-5 over the visor.  Even with the small car inside, there was plenty of room to see the road.  Listen to music and phone constantly.Bob, Shrewsbury, MA
5	1391040000	Very easy to use, great reception, although sometimes too great.  When I get home and pull in the garage sometimes I have to turn it off because once inside and I'm talking on the phone it may pull my phone call too the car. Easily solved by turning it off.Very reliable hearing you and others with highway noise.Would definitely recommend it.
5	1391040000	Its a gift for my son and he liked. Good equipment no hear noise in the calls very clear the instruccions. I recomended.
4	1390953600	The Freeway works so well, I'm not tempted to touch my phone while driving. Sound is great on both ends of the call.
5	1390953600	Have been using the Jabra Freeway for about a month now. Calls are very clear & my wife says she can't tell them I am not talking on a regular phone.
5	1390953600	I've had the Jabra FREEWAY for a few weeks now, and so far I'm pleased.  It's done what I expected it to do very well.  Phone calls through the internal speakers are clear, and nobody has had any issues understanding what I say.  The FM transmitter seems to work well, although I haven't used it very often.  I don't spend a lot of time on the phone, but it hasn't required charging yet.  The automatic power seems to work well - I definitely like not having to remember to turn it on when I get into the car.A few small notes:1) As soon as I got it, I plugged it in, paired it, and tried it out.  It was acting very strangely.  Once it had charged fully, I repaired it and everything worked just fine from then on.2) There are firmware updates available from Jabra that are supposed to address minor issues.  These can be installed through your computer.3) If you use Siri, you can activate it by simply holding the front button until it beeps again.  A few seconds later, Siri will kick in.4) So far I've had to restart the device twice.  No big deal - just flip the switch off and back on.
3	1390953600	it's not perfect, but it's good. sometimes when i use they hear me will.  but sometimes they can't hear they say my voice is not clear and lagging. which is period, but over all is good product
3	1390867200	Pros: Good sound quality when not using FM, simple to pair and use. Very long battery life. Nice looking. Accurate voice activation when unplugged.Cons: It's nice that the buttons are light to the touch. However, that makes it too easy to hit a button by mistake and trigger an unintended function. This happens a lot when re-positioning the sun visor. The FM function is useless. There's so much static noise, no matter what station is selected. I've tried the FM function in two different cars with the same results. I've also tried the FM function in a rural area with few FM stations around, but still got the same amount of static noise. I have a cheap FM transmitter that works much better. The bluetooth connection isn't always immediate and sometimes requires a manual connection from the phone. Sometimes I get in the car, drive for a good while before the unit suddenly says &#34;Connected!&#34; Sometimes it connects right away, other times not at all. Again, the same thing happens on two different phones, so it's not likely the phone's misbehaving. The voice activation feature doesn't recognize any command at all when the unit is connected to the USB charger. When unplugged, that works pretty well. I would've returned the unit for a refund if I hadn't tossed the box. I've been happy with other Jabra products, but I'm quite disappointed with this one.
5	1390867200	Allows me to listen to audio books and music in my truckGreat devise I enjoy it so much purchased one for my son for christmas.
3	1390867200	This was purchased for my teenage daughter.  The sound on this device just doesn't fill the car, and it sounds a little tinny.
5	1390780800	Best purchase I have made!  Must have this in the state of Illinois....buy a bluetooth vehicle or this....hmmm!!  This was just a little cheaper!!
5	1390780800	I love this unit. I have my audiobooks on an app in the iPhone. When I get in the car it speaks: &#34;connected&#34; I choose my audiobook, press play and me and my husband listen to it clearly. It's also good for talking on the phone and for the iPhone GPS. Love it
5	1390780800	the best you could find.If one thing I would suggest to improve, it's the sound quality of playing music.
5	1390780800	work perfect....should have added much earlier, sounds terrific coming through the car speakers !I would recomend this to everyone !
4	1390780800	Very easy to use and set up for both my Blackberry and Iphone.  Very clear reception in the vehicle.  The microphone does not pick up the passenger as well as the driver, but the reception for the driver is great.
3	1390780800	Works well enough, sometimes the fm transmitter randomly doesn't though and that's the main reason i bought it! Solid construction, and the speaker works well enough if there is low car noise outside.
5	1390780800	I ordered this for my husband.  He travels a lot for work and it so convenient for him to be able to talk without taking his hands off the steering wheel.
5	1390694400	Bought this as a gift and great so far. eachos every once in a while but other than that no complaints.
2	1390694400	too sensitive. i can be inside the house and not beable to take calls because it wont disconnect .voice activation and recognition poor.price to high for its faults.
5	1390694400	This has been a great product and purchase. A very-clean and clear sounding product within a compact tool.  Worth the money.
2	1390694400	Sounds good but doesn't listen good and understand commands. Have to push the buttons to make or answer call. Not totally hands free.
4	1390608000	This Jabra works great.  I have had no problems with it what so ever.  The only I think they can improve on is at start up it could tell you how much battery if left.  Other than that no complaints.
5	1390521600	It is all I expected. It have no Spanish language though. Anyway it is a very fine product. I recommend it.
4	1390521600	Good product that performs as expected. Good interface with iPhone 4S. Built in speaker is better than the FM feature. Battery lasts a long time with moderate use.
1	1390521600	I bought this for my girlfriend, and tested it with her extensively, on different days and different driving conditions.  Sound quality is just plain bad . . . akin to a weak-signal AM radio transmission.  We kept needing to repeat ourselves to be understood.  Also noticed that it doesn&#8217;t do duplex speaking very well - - only one person gets to talk at a time, like with walkie-talkies - - not a very natural way to have a conversation.  The lack of duplex leads to drop-outs and more clarifying &#8220;what?&#8221;s than we had patience for.  I returned it.  I can&#8217;t believe all the positive reviewers are having such a different experience &#8211; I don&#8217;t get that.  Maybe we got a dud.
4	1390435200	Has worked very well. Sound quality is great. The Speakerphone is easy to use and has a long battery life.
5	1390348800	I LOVE this speakerphone!  The reason I bought it is I plow snow and the Bluetooth ear pieces hurt my ears after a while.  I can talk on this while I'm plowing, and can hear clearly, and people can hear me and there is no back ground noise.  I don't use all the functions of it, but just being able to talk hands free is amazing.  Well worth the money, and I would recommend to anyone who doesn't like the ear pieces.
4	1390348800	I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend that does not do well with technology.  I used it first and liked it better than mine.  Easy to operate and pretty loud.  Only issue is I always had little static when I connected to the radio (even when I changed frequencies).  Tried to buy one for myself and the price went up about $20 in two weeks.
4	1390348800	It works very well.  It's a great substitute for blue tooth that comes with the car.  However, the FM Transmitter is really weak and it's only one station.  So, if you want to play music with it, it may be scratchy.  Otherwise, it's a great product.
5	1390262400	I purchased the Jabra Freeway as a test to make sure it's what they claimed. After using it for about a month I was so happy with it that I got 2 more and gave them to my kids as Christmas gifts. Hands free is the law in Illinois and it's safer and easier to use than the speaker phone. The audio is clear and very simple to use. I would recommend this for anyone wants to be hands free when using their phone.
1	1390262400	When I am driving I try to speak to the Jabra and it keeps telling me to repeat or can not understand what I said. When I take it off of my visor and speak about 3" from it, it still can not understand. Maybe my southern draw is confusing it.
5	1390262400	This product has a nice clear sound, and the people on the other side of the phone conversation were pleasantly surprised. Long battery life. Easy safe use.
5	1390262400	Very very happy with this purchase. Simply does what it says! The motion sensor based on and off is a very nice feature.
5	1390176000	This device is the best. Sound quality is excellent. A plus is that it connects to 2 devices at a time.You can answer your calls via voice prompt My only very small and inconsequential issue is that I'm having trouble connecting it to my FM radio.
4	1390176000	Works great mounts easily and charges overnight, ready to plug in and use. Won't correct any issues that you have with voice commands on your phone
2	1390089600	I bought these for my parents. Setup was easy but the voice commands suck. The Motorola Roadster II is a way better product.
2	1390089600	It quit working for awhile.  Had to blue tooth it a couple times to get it to work.  Does not call when it is suppose to keeps going to set up.  When it does work the speaker is clear.
1	1390089600	Does not function on FM at all.  Jabari sent me a replacement and it does not work either. Poor quality
5	1390003200	I ordered 2 of these for family for Christmas. As always, I am a last minute shopper and ordered them on the 22nd and received them 2 days later. As far as the product is concerned, I did my homework reading many reviews and the Freeway met and exceeded all of my expectations. It is very easy to set up and to use. The sound is phenomena considering there are only 3 small speakers in the unit. The voice quality on both ends are fantastic as well. I have already recommended the Freeway to many of my friends and family. If you are looking for an easy to use hands-free device, stop looking now and order one.
1	1390003200	I purchased the Jabra Freeway Bluetooth because of some great review. What a mistake.  I tried several times to get voice recognition to work with no success. When I would say call it would try to play music or it would call a name that wasn't even close to what I said. Terrible device. Sending back for refund
5	1390003200	Does everything they claim. The charge (battery) lasts a very long time. Great sound. Using with a Samsung Galaxy4. Worth every penny paid for it.
1	1389916800	Too much hype on this product. Does not work with Samsung Galaxy S3. When I called JABRA I was told that they do not provide support for phones and that I should contact Samsung. What a &#34;cop out&#34;, you sell a product that interacts with cell phones and you  won't provide any help at all - shame on you. Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife and we can't use it. I actually did a lot of research and this device got good reviews but mine is still sitting on a shelf because I can't get ANY help from JABRA.
4	1389916800	It does what it's advertised to do. Skiddle de da skiddle de dee. Why don't we do it in the road.
4	1389916800	I previously had the Jabra Cruiser (really enjoyed it) for years befoe it stopped working. I decided to get the Jabra Freeway as a replacement and I love the upgrade!  I did not rate it five stars as it does not read text messages.  Otherwise I have no complaints.
5	1389916800	I buy a lot of Bluetooth products from various suppliers and this is one of the best. You can not go wrong with this one.
5	1389916800	Make text messages, does web searches, makes and answers calls. And gps nice and load though you phone.  Battery is great been three weeks and still haven't needed to charged it. I love it. Just wish I could afford another for my other car.
5	1389830400	I would recommend this.  Needed for new law in Illinois and pleased with this product.  Choose the Freeway - for the little extra you get all the options
5	1389744000	Very cool. High volume. People say I DON'T sound like I'm under water. I get a lot of calls for work when driving, and I don't have to even touch my phone. If I get out of the truck and take phone, it connects automatically when I return.
5	1389744000	I had an old Jabra which worked, but I did not like to sound for listening to audio books.  This unit works very nicely.
1	1389744000	So far, we cannot get it to understand any of our commands.  Seems to have a mind of its own.  Will have to call Jabra to find out what is going on.  If we cannot get it to work, we will have to send back.
5	1389657600	It was very clear and if you leave it on, it syncs every time you get in the car without hunting for your phone. I have a southern accent so it doesn't understand some of my voice commands but that is ok with me.
5	1389571200	This is a wonderful product to have in my car. It always connects, does what it is suppose to easy to use. I would recommend it.
5	1389571200	I really like this unit as this one is actually loud enough that I can hear the conversation with the window rolled down. It has an FM transmitter but I have only used that feature a couple of times as I am happy with the volume level of the unit. Works flawlessly with my iphone 4s and the battery holds a charge for a long time. People on the other end hear me clearly and rarely realize that I am on a speaker phone driving down the road.
5	1389571200	I bought this for my daughter as she is having to commute.  She calls me when she is bored and talks and talks. From my end her calls are clear. She says it is easy to use and should buy one for the other drivers in the family.
5	1389571200	I love this thing. I take it to the bathroom to listen to music in the shower, and it lives in my car the rest of the time. Simple to pair and easy to use.
5	1389571200	This is exactly what I needed to make myself hands free.  Yes you need to touch a button to hang up... not a big deal.  To answer a call all I need to do is say... answer.  Set up was minutes.
5	1389484800	Jabra Speakerphone makes it possible to legally make those important phone calls while driving. Works like a charm. I was finally able to buy my daughter a Christmas present that is useful.
4	1389484800	Very nice sound and easy set up. But could be better with playing over the car radio cause  no free station without static.
5	1389398400	Great product, well worth price. Replicates much of functionality in new cars. I have two of them. They work great with Samsung Android S4 phone.
5	1389398400	Very pleased with the product.  It looks good and was easy to install and sync cell phone to.  Thank you for suggesting this item, it was an amazing gift and not expensive.
3	1389398400	My only complaint is it is not easy to use out of the box. It is a learning curve for sure and the instructions are not as straightforward as it could be. After a month or so, I still can't get it to work right. It appears it works best if you have siri turned off. If she is turned on, the bluetooth uses her instead and both product get confused.I wish I would have just gotten three of the belkin products instead. I will rate that product when I get down my list. That will be 5 stars.
4	1389312000	The product was very easy to pair and the voice reception is very good.  I replaced my bluetooth ear piece with this produce and would recommend the product for others to use
1	1389312000	I give this one star for several reasons. First, it is not user friendly. You have to pretty much figure it out yourself. The manual doesn't exist.  It's a do as you go. Second. You have to buy the texting and emailing feature after the free trial is over. The voice assist is a joke. I could go on and on about the reasons I wouldn't recommend this product. The commands are not recognized and it keeps asking you to repeat something as simple as the word battery. Don't buy this junk.
3	1389312000	Voice recognition does not work as well as advertised and often takes several attempts to get it to work but when it does recognize the voice commands it is great. You can place calls, read emails, as well as it will assist you by reading and sending texts via hands free voice if you start phone supports it which iPhones do.  I just wish I did not sometimes have to repeat commands nearly a half dozen times before it recognizes the commands. Voice recognition is inconsistent.
4	1389312000	I have been using the freeway for phone calls for about a month now.  The sound quality is good, but still a little difficult to hear when I am driving (ironically) on the freeway as there is too much background noise-even if the volume on maximum.  When I run the sound through the stereo that can help, but only works well if you do not drive around-when driving around, the stereo will pick up varying background interference which interferes with sound quality.  The microphone is about the same where people can hear what I am saying best when I am driving slowly and there is less background noise.  The voice commands are disappointing.  I have tried multiple times to &#34;call voicemail&#34; and it thinks I want to call some totally different sounding contact...even without background driving noise.I would recommend this product, but not have too high of expectations.
4	1389312000	The perfect gift for anyone that has a need to talk on the phone while driving.  A few problems dialing out (speaking commands not alway processed), but no problems with incoming calls.  Great speaker, bought one for my husband and daughter.....They both love it.
4	1389312000	One of the most handy features is the auto. on and off.  I do have some trouble getting it to understand my commands at times.  The FM feature is very nice.  Overall I would recommend it.
5	1389225600	I read reviews after reviews after reviews, watched YouTube videos, read more reviews, all while trying to decide which Bluetooth speakerphone is the &#34;best&#34; one for me. I have only had personal experience with the FREEWAY and it has not disappointed in any way. I drive an older Ford Explorer (not the quietest vehicle on the road) and I drive a manual Accord (changing gears and holding a phone and adjusting radio and eating all while driving, not a good idea). This FREEWAY is so loud and clear I have to turn it down when driving my Explorer! Excellent sound quality and high build quality; so far I am very pleased.
3	1389225600	I received the device and it paired seamlessly. However, the voice command for phone commands does not function or respond at all. The play (insert song name) command plays whatever was playing last.The only command that seems to work as advertised is the battery command. As far clarity during calls it works great... but that device I replaced with this one did as well.My assumption is that I may have gotten a defective device, or that I may not be doing something more (can't imagine what that might be, but it's very possible).I would recommend the device still, because as I said, it's probably just me.
5	1389139200	Gave this as a gift to my daughter who did not have a car with a built in speakerphone using bluetooth.  I rest easier knowing she can take and make calls without causing an accident!
4	1389139200	Like the fact that the base mounts to the visor and is out of way. Setup was a little confusing but help line took care of it.
3	1389139200	hard to set up. not  working  as well as we thought it would. commands are miss under stood.hoping it was as good as my factory installed system in my other car.
5	1389052800	I was at first skeptical as to the quality of this item but once it arrived and I put it to use in my own home it worked out to be very good.
3	1389052800	Looks nice, easy to set up, dual phone setup worked fine.  Sound quality only marginally better than the moto unit
5	1389052800	This is a brilliant device!  Clip it to your sun visor, and have instant bluetooth connectivity in your car.  I love the fact that the Freeway automatically turns itself on and off when you enter or exit the vehicle, and automatically connects to my iphone.  It actually connects faster than the built-in bluetooth in my BMW.  Sound quality for phone calls is very good, and hands free dialing works very well.  I do wish the volume buttons lit up, so it could be adjusted while driving at night.  Haven't gotten around to using it to play music through the car's stereo system yet, so I can't comment on that function.  Overall, though, I am extremely pleased with this purchase.
4	1389052800	Overall, very good, but making a call is sometimes difficult and confusing unless I make it directly from my phone.
5	1388966400	bought one each for my husband and son, since our state went &#34;Hands-free&#34; this year with cell phones.  Can't speak fro my son, but my husband - who is a bit of a non-geek - loves it!  Had no trouble figuring out how to use it.  Feel much better knowing he has this to use!
4	1388966400	I am using this car speakerphone in my home office.  Set up was a breeze with the automated prompts.  I especially like the power save feature - the device goes into a sleep mode to save power and is reactivated whenever you press something.  A couple of minor issues:  1) the sound quality is good, but I would not say great, 2) there is no indicator for low battery level, 3) this one is a personal preference - I did not like the voice prompts.  The box is always saying what it is doing (e.g. power on, power off...) -- but this is easy to turn off.
1	1388966400	I bought this for my Mom for Christmas. In theory, this sounds like a good idea. She is annoyed with, it will only call one person. No matter who she tried to call, it calls the same person. The speak on it is great, but its uselss if it doesnt recogonize anything you say.
5	1388966400	Great handfree device for areas requiring no cell phone use while driving.FM function is hit and miss as well as not very reliable for long commutes.Speaker and mic work great.
2	1388966400	I choose this rating because I do not believe this unit performs up to it's advertised statements. The claim was I could use my voice to make, answer, end, redial or reject without any membership in additional software, it didn't happen. Jabra will not respond to any voice commands unless I take a membership in &#34;Voice Assist&#34; that is free for the first year and $59.00 per year thereafter.Benefits: Clarity of incoming calls, battery life, attractive of course and the ability to speak at a normal voice and be hands free while driving. Of course this can also be said of many less expensive units. I have used the product for two months.
2	1388880000	It's good as a bluetooth speakerphone (but there are cheaper alternatives).The FM transmitter simply does not work. I do not know what makes it so difficult to connect with the car radio. At best there is sound with background static, otherwise it's just static with no sound at all. In any case you can't stream music or pandora radio from the phone to the car speakers. Hm-m... this thing goes back to Costco...
3	1388793600	I got this for Christmas and tested it on a few calls and listening to streaming audio (Stitcher Radio) and transferring the streaming audio to FM, interrupting streaming audio to call, using the iPhone 5 voice command, etc, all through the FREEWAY controls.  It is easy to setup and use with my iPhone 5 and to add my wife's iPhone 5 as well.  Voice prompts and instructions make it a please to use and control.  Both phone calls and streaming audio sound clear and are understandable (without the same bass response I get from the car radio speakers of course).  FM frequency finder did not automatically find a vacant frequency on my 2005 Honda Accord radio.  As my Honda does not have an RDS-enabled radio, it took about three tries for me to find one for around town by pressing Vol+ on the FREEWAY, then retuning my radio to the announced frequency.  The car speakers sound nice and I may want to use that all the time depending on battery usage. Unit comes on and off as advertised.  I have a detached garage about 30 ft from the house.  The iPhone indicates it stays connected all the way in the house until the FREEWAY goes off, which takes about a minute. FREEWAY controls are hard to see at night when mounted on visor. I wish they glowed a little in the dark, but I hope to memorize them soon. (I thought the night-time driving mode would do this, but it does not do anything that I can see.)
2	1388793600	The connection between the Bt and the cell is outstanding but once the transmission is done over the FM radio there is static sound at all times. I notice that the device does not  search the best radio station automatically, i actually have to do it  and once it is connected the static continues.A bit disappointment base on all the positive reviews i have read on this device. I mainly use it over the car stereo and it is no doing it for me.
4	1388707200	Great sound quality.  connects well to phone.Use it as external speakers for playing music, it's great!Good battery life also.
2	1388707200	The device itself is sturdy, stable and has a luxurious feel to it. The speaker is incredible as well. One major con of this product is the FM transmitter. My first complaint is that it can only stream on an FM station. In my area, there are very few open FM channels to choose from. My second complaint is that when the FM transmitter locks on to an open station, I can still hear a great deal of static in the line. I have decided to return this product and opt for the installation of an audio jack in my car radio so that I can purchase a Bluetooth with much better stereo integration.
5	1388707200	This works exactly how I expected and I don't have one complaint. Battery life is amazing!  Good clarity, easy to set up and even easier to use.  Won't take a drive without it!
5	1388707200	Works like a charm. I listen to audiobooks through my iPhone and make crystal clear handsfreecalls. What more do you want?
5	1388620800	I liked mine so much I bought one as a gift this year.  It works perfectly as described.  It's nice to connect the unit to the car speakers via FM radio.  That actually works even better for phone calls because the speaker being used is not right next to the microphone.
5	1388620800	Works great. Simple to set up. Soun is clear incoming and outgoing. Will probably purchase another for other car.On time delivery.
5	1388534400	I rarely write reviews. However, this one gets it all right. It looks good, the interface is good and I really like all the features. I play books over my phone. By using the blue tooth and FM feature, I am able to hear them over the radio. The battery life is long, the automatic connect feature great and the looks fantastic. I have tried all the other brands and found this one the best.
5	1388534400	An amazing bluetooth speakerphone for your car. Clear and crisp with no background noise.Amazon was quick to ship without an damage occurring during transport. Pretty amazing considering it was during the busiest time of the year, the Christmas holidays.
2	1388448000	The voice recognition is terrible!  The recognition amount is 1 in 6.  This is true even if the car is at a standstill and no exterior noise!
5	1388361600	Now that Illinois is going hands free Jan 1st I got this Jabra right on time. It's very easy to connect to. My music plays loud and clear, the speakers are rockin' for such a tiny thing, Also it understands my commands almost every time. I had one for about three months from somewhere else but I bought two more for my wife and son. We also used it in the backyard for barbecue's and play Pandora through it.
4	1388275200	THE Jabra Freeway is by far the best Bluetooth speakerphone I have tried. I sounds good and clear, I haven't used the FM part so can't comment on that. I would give it five stars except the voice recognition is not that good. sometimes when I say to answer the call it thinks I say to not except it.
4	1388275200	This is a nice speaker phone.  Allows two devices to be connected which is good.  In selected this one beciase of the FM transmitter plays through the car stereo.  I takes some trial and error to find a good station to use and there is a lot or road noise but overall it does the job.
4	1388275200	I purchased the Motorola Roadster for my wife for Christmas, and she purchased the Jabra freeway for me. We spent a considerable amount of time testing the two units side by side, and here are the results.Jabra Freeway ProsUnit turns on and off automaticallyThree speakers produce fantasic audio quality on callsOutgoing and incoming audio quality were fantastic and clearJabra Freeway ConsLarger unit, heavier than the MotorolaVoice recognition for placing calls was sub-par. The unit would either not recognize what we were saying or would dial someone completely different. I find myself using my phone to place calls routinely.Motorola Roadster ProsSmall, good lookingButtons light up brightly and make them easy to spotUnits turns on and off automaticallyVoice recognition for placing calls was decent, certainly better than the jabra.Motorola Roadster ConsAudio quality on both ends was passable but sub-par. Common complaint was "muffled" sound.Several menus and confirmations are needed to place calls using voice recognition. A little irritating and takes a long time.ConclusionBoth units have very similar features on paper, but performance is vastly different between the two and one definitely comes out the winner.While my wife likes the looks of the Motorola Roadster over the Jabra, there is very little else about the unit that we can recommend. Call quality was poor on our side and the receiving end, with the biggest complaint being "muffled" sound and having to talk louder than normal. The unit also requires you to pass through 3 to 4 prompts before actually placing a call, which proved to be frustrating.The Jabra on the other hand had excellent audio quality on both ends. The receiving end could hear us loud and clear, and the 3 speakers on the unit did a great job of reproducing the call audio. Even though the Jabra is not perfect, it comes out the clear winner due to audio quality.
1	1388188800	Got this for my wife for Christmas.  Had good and bad reviews, tried it anyway.  She tried using it in our Jeep and the person on other end could not hear her!  We thought it might be because the Jeep has more road noise than other vehicles.  Wrong!!  Tried it in our other vehicles and inside the house and it was the same, cutting out when she spoke.  Could only hear broken pieces of the conversation.  This thing sucks and is getting returned today!!Also,  it is MUCH smaller than it appears from pictures.  And the voice assist does not understand when you say a command.  Found ourselves repeating command a million times!!
5	1388188800	My husband wants me to use this as a handsfree device when I'm driving, and I'm warming up to that idea, but my favorite use is what a great speaker system it is for the music I have on my iPhone.
2	1388188800	Gave as gift. Receipiant has had trouble communicating with device.  Seemed to pair with my iphone better than her android. Possibly the reason?!  She was going to follow up with Jabara. But it is disappointing when you give as a gift and they have problems with it.
5	1388188800	love it bought as a gift and it works and sounds great now I don't have to worry about my daughter driving with phone in her ear. if you have kids no matter what you say they are going to do the oppsite
2	1388102400	At this point; not impressed.  We tried to load the most current firmware and received error saying the application loader was damaged.  Have to call tech support.  The product came with Voice Assist; tried to use that, but not working properly.  Have a call into tech support for that software.
4	1388102400	This is working fine for me in the car.  The only downside is the voice assist option seems to need several prompts to understand my requests.  Perhaps it can't adjust to my voice, I'm not sure.  I am still getting used to the product and need to familiarize myself more with the ins/outs of it.  But, overall, it is doing its job.  Actually, after using the Jabra for a week, I ordered 2 more as Christmas gifts for my husband and daughter.
5	1388102400	it works very well. i like it very much. when i drive the car ,i wont miss any call.it is wonderful
4	1388016000	rest assure that during a phone conversation you will hear and herd, the quality is good, it is well made, but they have missed one issue, in case you need to lower you sunshade they should've thought to make its support to be modified in a new position to maintain the sound quality , that's why i am giving 4 stars
2	1388016000	The info for the Jabra Freeway is not complete. After buying the Jabra Freeway, and it not working well, I found out , with difficulty that my phone is not compatible with the Jabra Freeway. This info is not in the packaging. So I have a useless Bluetooth speaker.
4	1387929600	Would give 5 stars but can't turn down computer voice.  And don't like that I have to pay 60 a year for truly hands free.
2	1387843200	Purchased the device on the recommendation of Verizon sales people, big mistake. People said I sound like I was in a box (lots of echo). The noise cancelling was poor. I could hear the other person fine. Music feature works ok. Device did not recognize voice commands properly first time. I returned the device and purchased the Motorola Roadster Pro which worked great under the same conditions I tested the Jabra on.
1	1387756800	This product worked OK out of the box.  After about a week, customers began to tell me that they couldn't understand what I was saying.  It works great as a speaker, but if you want something to use behind the wheel, go buy a bluetooth.
2	1387756800	The first model I ever bought had FM transmitter and overall I was quite happy with.  I raved about these things because I dislike having to wear one of the bluetooth ear pieces to talk in the car.  Since that first model, I've purchased about 5-6 of these (various models).  One thing that has bugged me is that volume control never works well with the Iphone.  I have never been able to get the speaker to have anything other than 100% volume when using an Iphone.  When I use my company blackberry, it works fine and volume adjusts as expected.Recently, with the Jabra Freeway, Iphone volume control is now supported.  I have now purchased 3 of these speaker phones, one for my office, and 2 for my cars.  The audio is always very good and now that volume control works (for Iphone), it is almost perfect.  The problem (and a big one) is that periodically, the microphone doesn't work well and produces a lot of feedback and &#34;down a long tunnel&#34; noise.  The thing is, I can't hear this at all on my end so can do nothing to correct it (turn off/on/etc...), it's always the people on the other end that notice it.  I know for certain it is the Jabra Freeway because using the built-in Iphone speaker works without any issue and prior to starting to use the new speaker phone, I had no complaints from callers at all (used blackberry plus Jabra Journey.  Nowadays, it is 2-3 times a day that I need to turn off the speakerphone and just use the built-in during a call.  It's to the point now where I need to return (at least the one I use in the office) so it's not possible to use it reliably.
1	1387670400	This is terrible.  I purchased this for my daughter so she could have hands free driving while she drives with her two children in the back seat.  The sound was terrible and it did not block out any outside noise like children in the backseat, as it was advertised.  I bought it ahead of time for her birthday and by the time we gave it to her and she installed it, it was too late to return it.  Very disappointing.  Unfortunately, this terrible gift cost me $80 and I'm stuck with it.
3	1387670400	I really like the freeway as a bluetooth speaker phone / speaker.It works great to listen to. 5 starsI bought it to use as an FM broadcast device so I could use myCar stereo for playing music & pod cast.  it gets -1 for that.It replaced a Jabra Cruiser II which operated great as a stereo interface.Luckily the speaker system is pretty good so I listen to podcasts through the device itself.Music however, will have to come from somewhere else....
5	1387584000	This product is the best out there.  I have had several Jabra products and the company has consistently manufactured superior products when it comes to Bluetooth technology.  I have had the BT8010 for 6 years and it is still going strong.Very easy to set up; it too 5 minutes.The only problem is with my FM turner, almost all FM stations are utilized in New Jersey so you might not get a good reception although it still works.Do not hesitate to buy this product.
5	1387497600	This is a Christmas gift for my husband for use in our motorhome.  He is always fumbling around for his phone and thought this would be alot easier for him to take calls.  Since it is not Christmas yet I cannot say how well it performs but am hoping it lives up to my expectations.
1	1387411200	If negative stars were an option, this product would qualify.Motorola Roadster has better features.  This product does not announce which phones are connected like the Motorola one does, nor does it indicate audibly the battery level.UPDATE:Been trying to use this for the past few weeks; find this product to be completely USELESS.  When using the voice command BATTERY, the unit takes me to PAIRING. When using the command VOICE COMMANDS, the unit calls VOICE ASSIST.  After trying literally 20 times to make a phone call using this unit, I was ready to throw it out the window. Finally had to pull over and dial the number from my phone.  Person receiving the call said the clarity was horsesh*t.I wouldn't give this product to my worst enemy.Going to purchase the Roadster from Motorola, which is what I should have done in the first place. Cost of education - $100.00!
5	1387324800	This was bought for someone who never like/used Bluetooth and he now uses it everyday in the cars and in the house as a speaker phone
4	1387238400	I bought this about 2 years ago and the reviews seemed to say this had a better noise canceling mic than most.  I agree with those reviews.Positives:1. Easy to set up using voice activation menu.1A. Answering incoming calls is super easy, you just tap the phone button on the FREEWAY, and don't need to even touch your phone when driving.  Hang Up the same way.2. Can/will connect to 2 different phones.3. Can use Skype on iPod/iPad/iPhone like it's the phone.4. Battery lasts a couple of weeks and charges quickly when it runs out.5. The voice quality is very good, people can hear me well, this is important to me.6. Could make a great speaker phone inside as well from computer.Other:1. The volume down button got jammed and doesn't work any longer.  This didn't affect my use so I never followed up with warranty. You can control the volume from the phone if needed.2. Works with Siri but it's a little sluggish with this middle layer and produces spelling errors that I don't get using the phone directly.3.  Range is very long.  With the motion sensing auto-on, if someone goes through the garage and this turns on, it will steal the conversation from my phone inside.  You find yourself losing phone calls.  The key is to actually turn the switch off so this doesn't happen.4. FM modulation sort of sucks for playing music, better to stick with a cord.  There are too may radio stations where I live to find a frequency that's empty enough for this feature to really work.  If I was out in the country it would be better.  Something about having the conversation play through the car speakers would be ideal but doesn't work perfectly with this in a major metropolitan area.I do recommend it as being as close to bridging the gap if your car isn't new enough to have a good bluetooth.
5	1387238400	I have tried many of these, not to mention standard ear bluetooth headsets. I have a bose, that works good, but lousy battery life. This work better than anything I used or tried. I am getting another one today for my car.
5	1387152000	It's very clear, the person on the other end doesn't even know you're on a Bluetooth. Worth it's weight in gold!
4	1387065600	I use the device to listen to audio from my phone while commuting, I live in a large-ish metro area and have a fair amount of interference with the FM signal to my car stereo. I am still able to reasonably listen, just have yet to find a 100% static-free frequency. The battery life is better than expected, and Bluetooth connectivity works great. Sound quality on calls is great as well, my wife can't tell the difference between a regular phone conversation and when I'm hands-free with the devIce.
5	1387065600	Not only does this work very well as a speakerphone (with two microphones for better noise cancelling) but it can send anything from my phone via FM to my radio (I have an older car without a direct connect). The FM feature was a very pleasant surprise!
4	1387065600	Pairs up flawlessly! Voice clarity is great.  If you are using this only as a bluetooth device to make & receive calls, it is great. If you use voice commands, works good most of the time. Occasionally you will need to turn off, then back on and then it works fine. I am using with an iPhone 4s and iPhone 5. If you purchase this to send and receive texts, that is more difficult.  I finally gave up, and decided to be happy with the sound, easy pairing, and auto on/off feature.  The battery also lasts a long time!
5	1386979200	save on tickets.........this is better than the motorola ones......easy to recharge and charge lasts a long time....very simple to operate.
1	1386979200	Well, failed in this way: Now it takes two or three or four repetitions of the command "Play" for the Jabra to play. Even then it starts with a stutter, stops, starts again, and then often as not stops one or two more times before continuing. The sound isn't great even when it works. Overpriced junk. Nice idea, if only it worked for more than two years, let alone a few months.UPDATE: Contacted the company and they have not bothered to respond. Not a good business to do business with, not at these prices.
1	1386979200	The description omits that in order to use iPhone features other than making and receiving calls, a third party app has to be obtained that is free the first year and then $3.99 per month thereafter.  Other similar products have total interface with the iPhone without doing somethng like this.
4	1386979200	Pros: Decent battery, good portability, easy connect.Cons: speaker could be louder, FM transmitter is very poor quality.A good value overall.
5	1386979200	It does what it should and holds a charge. The mike is great and speaker sound quality is surprisingly good. I wish it would turn off more quickly because it catches the phone from the house unless I turn off my Bluetooth but I have been trained.
5	1386892800	it works just as advertised. easy to use and all is crystal clear. I have one question and this problem is not unique just to Jabra as it has occurred with Motorola too. when I say to call Amy it says calling 5 different people and this is the only name I have this problem with. any idea why?
5	1386892800	Great size, reliability and usefulness, Illinois law requires statewide compliance to hands free law in January 2014.Easy bluetooth connectivity.
5	1386892800	I bought this for my wife to use, so she has more experience with it, but I've used it a few times to be able to review it.  As far as Bluetooth speakers go, it works great.  I've been using a Motorola T505 for a few years, so that's my yardstick, and that unit works very well.  What's great about this is the auto-on/auto-off feature that recognizes movement in the car, eliminating the need to have to turn the unit on and off. The only downside is that when the car's parked in the garage, the car and unit are within distance so that it keeps broadcasting phone activity through the unit in the car when we're in the house! I haven't figured out how to get around that yet other than turning it off before exiting the car, but that defeats the auto feature.  Otherwise, it works great and the dual speakers do provide for good, strong audio. Controls are intuitive and easy to use.
4	1386892800	If you are driving a 6spd, this is the only way to go.  Really is functional and allows you to focus on driving.  Normally Amazon has the best price, but just noticed that Costco is $20 cheaper.
5	1386806400	So easy to  use!  People have had no complaints of not being able to hear/understand me so thats a relief and most important to me
4	1386547200	Great product, setup was easy. It connects automatically, it announces the calls. It connects to two phones so when two people are in the car who who both have phones setup with it, both phones are connected. The music also plays from it automatically. I have not tried what happens if both phones receive call at the same time. The only thing annoying is that when we enter the car it announces multiple times that phone is connected, sometimes 3-4 times.
4	1386547200	I have tested and owned many different Bluetooth Speakerphones for the car and this Jabra freeway model is the most reliant combined with great sound. It delivers what is expected but your cell phone model and QUALITY  is KEY ! The jabra freeway is awesome and works well if you have a newer smartphone with the technology in order to operate to a higher standard with less call malfunctions.
5	1386547200	Great. Does exactly what I wanted of it. This is my fourth Jabra BT and I love all of them. My first device came free with my cellphone and lasted 5 years.
5	1386460800	This is a terrific product.  I am using this after two years and find it as a first class hands-free device.  just be aware that if you're close to it outside the car and it is still ON, you may not receive your calls on your phone.
3	1386460800	worked great as a speakerphone...not so much as an FM modulator for the car radio. I ended up returning this and having a $99 bluetooth car radio installed in my car.
1	1386460800	Don't waste your money. I am so frustrated with this. I read all the rave reviews and don't get it. Sometimes I have to command the speaker a dozen times or more and then the friendly voice asks if I need help. It likes to dial one number rather than the one I ask it to. Sometimes the volume is not loud enough. I find myself yelling at the unit.
5	1386460800	It does what I expected of it. I drive a delivery truck and could never hear my phone. With the Jabra Freeway that's not a problem anymore.
3	1386374400	I found this speakerphone to be a bit of a mixed bag. As a speaker for the phone, it does a pretty good job. I've had it for about 2 months, and so far, it seems like people can hear me well and I can hear them. Making the connection was pretty easy, and the battery time is lasting me more than a week...though, I only use a few times a week. However, as a speaker to play music from my iPhone, it pretty much stinks. The music sounds tinny and lacking in any range on bass or tenor ends. So far I'm having trouble finding an auxiliary connector that connects from my car to the 8-pin iPhone 5s. So I'm disappointed that the dual purpose promoted for this item is really not the case. But as a speakerphone for phone calls on the iPhone, it does a great job.
3	1386374400	if you have extremely quiet vehicle this is ok but if not try another brand!can not use in my truck tooo much noise comes thru speakerphone. not satisfied for the reason i purchased.hope this helps someone in need of speakerphone
1	1386374400	Most frustrating thing ever! Wouldn't have another if someone have it to me. Almost impossible to make outgoing calls. Must be set in another language, cause it doesn't reply to English!
1	1386288000	This would be a great Hands-Free speaker, the sound is good. BUT the voice recognition is truly APPALLING! It really is one of the very worst examples of how some companies cannot get the technology right. The amount of times I've had to try and unlock my phone whilst driving because the device called the wrong number. It's incredibly frustrating. ANd it doesn't just call similar sounding names IE &#34;Call Beth&#34; became &#34;Calling Unioncard&#34;. Awful, awful, awful. I say 'Answer', it says &#34;Call rejected&#34;. It's like a joke. Very disappointing.
2	1386288000	incoming call volume too low - what? what? I can't hear you - same as all the other models I've tried
4	1386288000	This works better than i expected. The only good/bad/good thing is that it connects to my phone before i get in my truck so if i'm on the phone it will pick up before i get in the truck.( solution is to turn off Bluetooth as you leave and turn back on when you are close or in  the vehicle.........oh yeah and it work great as an extended speaker so i take it out of the truck and use it around the house and the office.
1	1386288000	What happened to Jabra?  My trusty Jabra cruiser died.  I purchased a Jabra journey first only to find out that it didn't support fm transmission and the built in speaker is distorted beyond belief.  I contacted support and they told me to upgrade the firmware (reading from some script).  I finally broke down and purchased two freeway units from my local club.  Although these were better than the journey, the fm feature did not work.  The only frequency I could get anything on was 91.5 even though plenty of other bands had nothing but static on them.  On 91.5 I got static interruptions most of the time. It looks like they have reduced the fm transmission power of these units to they point this feature is unusable.  My favorite was pressing the autofind frequency button only to have it find a channel with a radio station!?  I can find the radio station myself!?Now I'm sure that the other features are nice.  Not if I can barely understand what the person on the other end of the line is saying. On my old cruiser, the fm transmission came through the radio crystal clear.The built in speaker is slightly better than the journey, but not worth an upgrade cost.  Both of these Freeway units are going back.  I may have to go back to an earpiece or maybe see if I can find a cruiser somewhere.
3	1386288000	I was hoping this would be much better than my ear piece with my iPhone 4S, but from what people are telling me it really isn't much better from their end. One guy says I sound like I am in a drum. The audio from the speakers is pretty good as well as the audio through the FM output to my stereo. So far the voice command feature for my contacts is not working too well, but I will say I have not played with that function much. If I do and I see it's really good I'll update here. I have had this a couple of days now and I am considering returning it. Not sure yet...
5	1386288000	Easy to set up; easy to use; very clear. Neatly fits over the visor. Worth the money. Yes I recommernd it to others
3	1386288000	I really love this device, but unfortunately it has the stupid built in command system in the way of actually being usable.  So, it's a nice external speaker, but if I speak to it while driving it almost never understands what I'm saying.  If I am not driving it works better, but I hate having to say &#34;Phone Commands&#34; just to talk to Siri on the iPhone.  Our cheaper Motorola device just lets you press a button and you're talking right to Siri.Even so, most of the time when I say &#34;Phone Commands&#34; while driving it either tries to call some &#34;Assist&#34; number or ignores me altogether.  Literally, while driving I press the button and say &#34;Phone Commands&#34; and it will respond with &#34;You can say...&#34; message or &#34;Calling ...&#34; or anything but Siri.  When I stop at a light (so it is more quiet) and do it then after a few seconds Siri's little tone comes on and everything works as you'd expect.If someone calls me and I say &#34;Answer&#34; it most of the time says &#34;Ignoring&#34;.My guess is the microphone in this unit just doesn't handle any kind of background noise very well.Ironically, if I do finally connect with someone they can hear me just fine.I don't have any kind of weird accent (I am an American from Oregon).If there was a button to just get to Siri I'd easily give this a 5-star rating.  As it is, their improvements make it almost unusable for regular driving.I'm going to keep it to use as a speaker for podcasts even though I have to set them up manually.  The speakers sound really good.Maybe Jambra should have a switch somewhere that turns off their &#34;smart stuff&#34; and allows people to just use their phones like they normally would.  That would make this a much better device in my opinion.  I wish it worked.  I would totally love it.
4	1386201600	Works pretty good. I have tried numerous ear pieces and a couple of speakerphones with poor results. The Jabra Freeway has so far worked the best with good clarity on both ends of the conversation. My only complaint is that the Jabra does not always understand my voice commands. Sometimes I have to actually dial with the phone and then can speak over the speakerphone.
4	1386115200	Easy to use, clear communication when making calls. The speaker is also much louder than other speakerphones available on the market, making playing music through it tolerable if the car radio isn't available. The only thing I don't like is the FM feature is starting to become obsolete - with so many radio stations clogging up the band, it's hard to find a consistent, clear station. I've also tried the Motorola Roadster 2 which had the same FM issues, so it's definitely not Jabra's fault.
4	1386028800	This product work well for us.  It's reliable and clear.  I got an older model car and I was not ready to spend a fortune to get one of those speakerphone systems installed.  We've owned the Jabra for a year now and we are very happy.  I usually wait a year to write most of my reviews so I can be more confident about the product.
5	1385856000	I have a 2002 car that does not have connectivity but it has a great Bose stereo. I use the Jabra Freeway to make phone dlls, but mostly I use it to stream music from my iPhone 4S.It works amazingly well in my town. The music sounds just like coming from a CD.However, when I travel to areas that have more radio stations, I sometimes have to change the station I use because I get static sounds.
3	1385856000	I have 2 of these for my 2 vehicles. Works great when it works right. Can be finicky. It doesn't always automatically pair or it randomly disconnects. I have 2 phones paired at the same time. It seems to like the Blackberry better than my old LG flip phone. It won't always answer or end a call on that phone when tapped to answer. Audio quality is very good and it seems to hold a charge for a decent amount of time and it is unobtrusive up there on the visor. I never use the FM transmitter though I have tried it. Not very good in the NY Metro area with all of the different FM signals to compete with.
3	1385424000	The blue tooth isn't strong enough. it's always dropping the signal via blue tooth. the previous jabra is a lot better.
5	1385251200	It makes hands-free cell phone use possible.  Great sound.  Clips to your visor.  Very smart device!  Try it; you'll like it.
5	1385078400	Works great, loud and never had a complaint. Long battery life.  I have had it in my car for 3 or 4 weeks now and havn't had to recharge it yet.
4	1384992000	Overall, the unit is great with very clear audio.  The FM feature is worthless.  When using it through the FM option, the audio is full of static and the FM radio station bleeds through.  Virtually unusable through the FM feature. .
4	1384992000	Mostly very good, but it's *extremely* loud by default, and I cant upgrade the sofware because I use a Mac (driver updates are only for Windows). Still a much cheaper solution to getting bluetooth in your car than buying a new one.
4	1384992000	Works well for the price. Easy to set up and use. Voice quality is good. It would be nice if it announced the phonenumber
1	1384992000	wow.. didn't just work as advertised.. Documentation on Factory Reset.. not as advertised.. as well.. always sent me to their paid voice assistant.. No Thx
4	1384819200	Voice quality is very good, as people on the other side of my phone calls tell me.But the FM transmitter feature doesn't work in my car (Mazda 3 with roof antenna). The transmitted signal power from the Jabra Freeway is too low for noise-free reception (I tried many different FM channels).If you don't need this feature of using car speakers for your phone calls then it is a great Speakerphone. I do like that it pairs automatically with my phone when I get in the car and with the long battery life I don't need to have a cable hanging of it. The built-in speakers work well for phone calls because of the location close to the head when mounted on the visor.
3	1384819200	I hace an old habr&aacute; ir works marvellous!!!  Got this for my brother because ir seemed nicer the design and well not as good as mine!!  A lots of interference.  Can't hear him we'll!!!  Very disappointed!!!
4	1384732800	Very good hands free. Connects easily.The FM feature is largely worthless in our crowded radio marketplace.But that is not why I purchased it.
2	1384473600	I was really hoping this would work better for me.  Unfortunately it didn't.  I made phone calls and the person on the other end was never able to understand me.  All they heard was road noise.  When pairing to my radio the stations the device searched for optimal connection were always very staticky.  The only good thing about this device was the sound quality using the device speakers to listen to my pandora stations from my phone.  I never had luck listening via FM.  Horrible connection and sound.
4	1384473600	I'm using my Ipad Mini with cellular for my Navigation, Music Player, and Siri.  The Ipad Mini navigation and Music player works with my car USB/Ipod input but Siri doesn't.  This Jabra solved my problems with Siri connecting to this Jabra through bluetooth and also connect my Iphone through bluetooth.  Yes! You can connect 2 Bluetooth devices working at the same time! Thanks You!
5	1384473600	My wife loves this thing - works great with very long battery life.  We tried using an FM transmitter and it does work very well in urban areas with lots of radio stations, but this doesn't need it since it has it's own speakers.  Very easy to set up and use.
5	1384387200	I had my doubts but the price on Amazon was too good to pass up and this worked out great. I got spoiled with blue tooth in my other cars and since my new car did not have blue tooth for my phone this one exceeded my expectations I would highly rate this any too anyone in need of a blue tooth device for you phone in your car.
1	1384300800	We bought two of these units to drive across country in two vehicles and stay in touch. It was a waste of money because most of the time the sound quality was so poor we just talked on the phone when we needed to communicate.
3	1384300800	I've had this for one week now and overall I'm pretty happy with it, and I'm still trying to figure out how to use it best.  The sound from the 3 speaker system is great, better than expected, and a vast improvement over a $30 bluetooth speaker I had been using in my car.  If the FM transmitter feature didn't work, I'd still be happy with the sound quality I get for my music, which is probably the most important feature for me with this device.  BUT THE FM TRANSMITTER DOES WORK for me in my 2002 Toyota Corolla, despite the problems other reviewers have complained about and the problems in general with FM transmitter technology.  And I live in a dense urban area.  It's great to have my tunes on my car stereo, as well as calls and my voice navigation or whatever else I'm doing.  For me, I've found a couple stations that work fine for my commute to work and around town that I don't have to change stations for.  I don't know how well it will work on a long roadtrip in other areas but we'll see.It does charge in two hours in my car or in any USB port, and the battery life is extremely good so far.  The item is small enough to put in my pocket if I want to take it in the house to charge, or I can pop it in my glove box if I don't want it visible when my car is parked in a questionable neighborhood.  Also, I've had no problem with the automatic on and off feature, works fine for me; and it's really no big deal to use the manual on/off switch anyway so I don't know why anyone would complain about that.The Jabra website has a more detailed and easier to read User Manual that you can download, which is easier to read and follow than the tiny little booklet that comes with the original packaging.  Also, there's a new driver for download on the website which is easy to install (it doesn't tell you this, but just connect your Freeway to your computer USB port and then execute/run the driver download file that you've downloaded to that computer).  New driver installs automatically.  Other reviewers complained that the voice prompts are too loud, but they don't sound too loud to me, so maybe they did fix this problem with the driver update.The biggest problem I've had is with Voice Assistant.  I made a couple calls with it.  Not sure how useful it will be for me.  Because Freeway does work with my android personal assistant app (Speaktoit Assistant) running on my Galaxy Centura phone (a Siri like app for android).  This gives me the ability to make calls directly, and access numerous other apps on my phone (music player, Scout GPS navigation, social networking apps, calendar, etc.  And my Assistant will read my incoming text messages, send texts or emails, get news, weather and search for anything.  So I'm not really sure that I need Voice Assist anyway.  It's also a pain to setup your contacts separately with your Voice Assist account and then I will manually have to keep updating/syncing my contacts with Voice Assist.  That's a hassle I don't need.  Also, I've now tried having Voice Assist read my emails.  This is useful.  However, Voice Assist has a really terrible robotic female voice, really primitive by today's standards.  I can't believe they use such a terrible robotic speech engine.  Very unpleasant.Also, although it pairs automatically with my phone with a very easy setup, for some reason I've had to repair it a few times when it hasn't connected automatically.  Not sure why this is happening.The Freeway doesn't always recognize my voice commands--there are only a handful and they're simple like "Play" for play music, or "Battery" to check battery level, but it's frustrating when I have to repeat myself several times, and I'm not sure why this happens sometimes and not other times.I make and receive very few calls in my car, so if this was my most important feature I'd definitely have to lower my rating.  Also, while Freeway is working good with my Speaktoit Assistant, I discovered it wouldn't work at all with an alternative top-rated android assistant I was trying out, Nuance's Dragon Mobility Assistant.I'll update my review later after I've had more experience.UPDATE:  After two more weeks of usage, I'm downgrading this to 3 stars.  The voice/command recognition, with or without Voice Assist, is very poor.  It's very frustrating to repeat commands five or six times and still not have them understood.  I have a clear loud voice, no accent.  Very frustrating.
3	1384300800	Overall pretty decent. Voice control works fine, motion sensor works good. Biggest down fall for me, is the FM transmitter, very weak signal, tons of static on most channels, I find myself having to change stations multiple times even on short drives.
5	1384300800	Best Bluetooth speakerphone out there.  And i have tried many.  This one connects fast and without hassle.  Also like the Voice Assist service which i recommend, especially as driving and texting is becoming a heavy hitter now in many states.
3	1384300800	I didn't realize that you had to purchase a monthly subcription if you want to use the part that dials your numbers automatically. I would not have bought it if I had known this. I also didn't work with my Iphone 3gs. It does with my 4gs and now 5gs.
5	1384300800	After trying several different Bluetooth devices, I tried this one, and I think we have a keeper. I ordered it for our CEO, and he hasn't complained about it once, so I think it's probably a very good product.
5	1384214400	Surpisingly, the battery has lasted me longer than what the box claims. I have not charged it in a month after continuous use. I drive a lot and over long distances, so I use it quite often. I am really happy about my battery's capacity, especially since it has that automatic 'off' feature when you leave the car overnight. Granted, when I first got it, I charged it for a full 12 hours even though it was almost fully charged. So that might have something to do with the amazing battery life that I've been getting.As for the sound quality, I really can't compare it to other bluetooth speakers. This is my first one. Although, I can say that it sounds much better than the phone's speaker, and that it greatly amplifies the sound with its 2 or 3 audio speakers. For its build, Jabra used some premium quality materials to build this one. So expect this product to last for a while.For the quality and the price, I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for a hands-free alternative when making and receiving calls.Oh, did I mention it has a feature that lets you answer the call by voice so that you don't have to pick your phone up and see who it is?
4	1384041600	This product worked right out of the box without reading the instructions -- and I'm someone who usually needs to go 'step by step'. I've had it about 3 weeks and it's already second nature to make calls with it.the volume is a bit loud, but otherwise it does exactly what I need it to -- make and receive phone calls.
4	1384041600	Pros..Nice clear sound and easy to use.Cons.. The FM option is not the best .I have tried 20 different channels and you have to have the radio volume turned 3/4 or higher . Then there is still a lot static/ humming noise.
5	1383868800	Just an all around excellent product. Easy to set up and use, clear as a bell sound, automatically connects, etc. You won't be disapointed.
2	1383868800	This item lasted about a month. I would not recommend. Shop around for a better product. Does not compare to other Jabra products.
3	1383696000	It works but 2/3 of the people on the other end of the call say they know it's not as good as it normally is when I have my cell phone to my ear. Tonight on my way home i called my brother. He mentioned w/o my asking that he was hearing some static in the backround. I lowered the visor as low as i could w/o blocking my view and he said that was better. At this point the freeway is maybe 12 inches from my mouth.I have to put up w/ it since a new Md law makes holding a cell in your hand while driving a primary offense. The Bluetooth range is also a problem. I have no idea why it is so far as I am sitting within 18 inches of the thing when driving. When I get out of the truck and go into the house it seems to disconnect OK. If I go into my garage workshop w/ the truck parked about 8 feet from the garage doors it often connects to my phone.
5	1383696000	This is a great product. It works and sounds very good. Easy to set up, the sound is very good, considering the size. Battery life is also great i definately recommend this.
5	1383609600	This is a very good product. Very easy to setup and use. It made my life on road easy. I recommend this product if your car doesn't have built-in bluetooth.
5	1383350400	Gave it as a gift for someone with a smart phone (iPhone 4S)  and an old car (no blue tooth).  She's very happy with her birthday gift and works like a charm with good sound. Easy to set up and use. Inexpensive and safe way to go hands free.
5	1383350400	No need to go into great detail - this is just a great product that works exactly as you'd expect it to. Set up is totally idiot proof, sound quality is excellent and the product looks and feels well made. I leave it on my desk and use it as a speaker phone so I can type while talking on the phone. If I am going for a longer car ride and want to be able to talk hands free I clip it in the car and away I go. Works perfect with iPhone 5.
4	1383264000	I got this for Mustang Convertible.  I am a singer and use this to play my Music and lessons in the car from my I-phone.  I really like it.I need to search for a better FM station though. The one that was preset has a little static sometimes.Very nice addition though.
5	1383264000	Really enjoy this product.  I travel quite a bit and this works great and the battery almost last a week on a charge.  I don't use the fm function because the speaker is fine and this really makes my phone navigation useful
2	1383264000	When you say commands it does not understand what you say, just understand  - word &#34;answer&#34;. Also its microphone not working clearly! This product is really disappointing
2	1383264000	Bad quality Voice. sometimes it has a good quality Voice, sometimes it is impossible to hear something. also usually have some problems with Mic
4	1383091200	Awesome product for me and my iPhone 5. Just leave my phone in my pocket and it auto connects. One flick of the fm button and I am connected to my car stereo. Best feature for me is leaving the car while listening to music and having it resume when I get back in the car automatically. I wouldn't bother with the voice assist feature and just chose to use Siri. Voice assist has no extra benefit that I can find. I'd rather not have to dial an 800 # to connect to voice assist.
5	1383091200	When I decided to buy this I bought it having read all the feedback. I didn't have high expectations but I figured what he hell. I drive an M3 and have an iPhone 4S. I think it matters what car u have ( for FM) and what phone you have. I wanted it for Bluetooth streaming for podcasts. Based on the reviews if FM actually worked it would be a bonus. Ordered and got within 2days normal delivery - great. Charged it, synced all easy. Tried it no problem. Tried FM first channel worked first time.3weeks later. No problems. FM bit spotty based on atmospherics but when gets too bad turn FM off with one touch and its loud enough ( so long as u turn up the volume on the phone). Only really annoying thing is the volume of the units pre-recorded messages as described in other feedback. You can live with one message. Don't use it for phone calls.3 months later no issues
5	1383004800	Love this! Have upgraded from previous Jabra! Jabra's are great and easy to operate!Thank you seller!Can always depend on Amazon!
4	1382918400	Still trying to get used to it - but works for the intended purpose.  Will continue to use it though.
5	1382918400	Very happy with product, connects automatically when I enter van.considering buying another one for another vehicle.I recommend this product.
3	1382832000	Smaller than I expected but that's a good thing. Bluetooth connects quickly to my Iphone 5 once paired. Voice commands on the Jabra are just ok.  Speaker sound is great but breaks up at highest level. FM transmitting is 3 out of 5 for clearness. The FM auto scan is worthless. You need a FM station with no other stations close in frequency next to it. The Jabra is better at talk radio podcast than playing music. Phone conversation are clear on both ends through the Jabra.
4	1382659200	I received this quickly and the product was well packaged. No problem with syncing to any of our phones. The sound quality was excellent with no dropout. The battery life is also excellent; I have no complaints with this product.
5	1382659200	I purchased the Freeway because my son in law has one and I was impressed by the sound quality of the speaker and sound level.The price was great and the unit is easy to use much better than using a ear unit. I would recommend this unit for safety for hands free use. The best feature is that it shuts off when you leave your car and turns again on when you return to your car.
4	1382572800	I was very skeptical about this product, but needed to find something that would be hands-free in the car that wasn't a headset. I have gone through every type of Bluetooth ear piece and headset out there and hated them all. They either weren't comfortable, didn't stay in my ear, or the sound was crap on either end. I was worried the sound would be bad with this product, but it's not at all. It's clear and crisp, even for the person on the other end when I have the window open driving down the road. I also have taken it out of my car and used the speaker for the radio on my phone out at the bonfire up at our family farm. connecting through the speakers in my van, but because I live in a somewhat metro area, finding a radio station that doesn't come in at all proved difficult, so if you planned on using this for that feature, you may want to look into another product unless you live in the middle of nowhere.
4	1382572800	It is excellent for hands free talking on the phone and answering calls. It has made it so much easier for me to talk on the phone while driving. The voice commands don't work as well as I would like and the music through the fm radio is good but sometimes you hear interference on the station more then I would like. However, overall I would recommend it to someone who does not have an auxiliary connection in the car for their phone. It is a great solution.
5	1382572800	Excellent  product I like so much and I recommend it to have itIt's work very good and for long distance
4	1382486400	Works as advertised, the only problem I have is with the fm. Can not find a clear frequency. No matter what station I put my radio on I have to much static to use the fm connection.
5	1382400000	My husband had the older version and this one has better features for sure. No complaints here. I recommend this product!
4	1382400000	I seriously am glad I got this bluetooth speaker as I don't have to fumble for my headset whenever I get a call in the car now.  The volume is LOUD even if you turn it down and it picks up your voice very well.  Another plus is that compare to the Jabra Journey, it doesn't remind you every 30 seconds that it's turning on or off.
5	1382313600	Performs MUCH Better than expected! The look, fit and trim is better than expected. Is easily hidden from eyes eliminating any fear of theft. All in all : Buy It as it Really Is one of very few products that descriptions just can't do justice. Pairing is Dead Simple and is automatic after the first time. The FM radio connection gives better sound than other &#34;named&#34; brands. It really is a gorgeous piece of electronics that outperforms the best! Is there anything I left out? It doesn't matter as I've already said that I like it a little bit, lol !
1	1382140800	Picked this up when I changed phones.  I followed the directions and out of about a dozen attempts to make a call "according to the instructions," it's worked twice and that's it!  The unit seems to be well-made, but what good is a nice looking unit when it works less than 20% of the time.  Would you drive across a bridge or be happy with a bridge that gets you across the river 17% of the time.  Big disappointment!  I would rate this as zero if I could because I don't think it deserves a 1.
3	1382054400	Pro  it has a great speaker.  easy to pair a device.Cons,The fm transmitter doesn't work, it has too much noise.  and it is not clearyou can pair two phones, but it doesn't automatically connect to both.  it only connects to one device at time.it can not pick phone calls on second device.
3	1381968000	What I love about it: Nice clear sound on incoming calls, no cut-offs and the start of sentences like some bluetooths.What i am disappointed with: Voice Assist feature is very poor at recognizing words (as simple as &#34;yes and no&#34; commands). You have to download your phone contacts into Voice Assist (through their website) and more often than not it  gets the contact name wrong on calls I am attempting to make. It says: &#34;Do you want to call___________?&#34; I say &#34;no&#34; and it doesn't register that even, it keeps asking me &#34;say yes or no&#34;.  Frustrating.Bottom line: if you use the Jabra without the Voice Assist feature, all it does is answer incoming calls. It does that very well. However to do anything more, you have to use Voice Assist ( free with subscription for the first year). And this software leaves alot to be desired. It sure doesn't work as nicely as that video!
4	1381968000	The Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth looks good in the car, and its very stream line and also works just like it says.I guess I was just expecting a little more. BUT, yes I would say: The Jabra FREEWAY is a good product to buy & Iwould buy it again if need be.
4	1381881600	CAN'T IMAGINE SOMETHING BETTER REGARDING HANDS FREE PHONE CALLTURNS OFF ONCE YOU'RE OUTTURNS ON AND SAIS &#34;CONNECTED&#34; ONCE YOU GET INYOU CAN WORK WITH SIRI (IPHONE USERS ONLY)ANNOUNCES WHEN YOU HAVE A PHONE CALL AND WHO'S CALLING ALSO, AND YOU JUST SAY &#34;ANSWER&#34;,AND !BOOM! YOU'RE ALREADY SPEAKINGWOULD APPRECIATE A SPANISH FIRMWARE (WHAT HAPPEN HERE? THERE ARE MANY OTHER LANGUAGESBUT NOT SPANISH)FM TRANSMISSION NOT SO GOOD.
4	1381881600	Instructions for making a call are incomplete - a serious omission. Had to experiment till I figured it out. Now that it is working it is great. Reception on both ends of call is very clear and static free. I am very pleased with it. Fix instructions.
2	1381795200	I purchased this thinking it would be great, well only "marginal" and I will try to give the "Pros and Cons"Pros:  Great sounding speaker for voice direction and callers clarity of voice.Cons:  *Echo when volume is barely turned up, seemed like it was up too loud which gave it an "echo" or down too low to hear.* Noise cancelling can cause the receiving caller to hear a "choppy sound" when road noise is present "most of the time".* my wife complained that it was hard to get it to recognize her voice commands.* CANNOT REVIEW MUSIC FEATURE DIDN'T TEST IT.*****Returned it Bought 2 of the "BlueAnt SENSE Bluetooth S3 Speakerphone" here on Amazon Rocks @ less than half the price! ***B005KF8V5Q
1	1381795200	The sound quality for the phone receiving a call from this device is very poor and almost unintelligible.  Also it is very slow to respond to voice commands to my I phone.  Tried to work with it but could not improve the voice quality.
4	1381795200	I purchased the Jabra Freeway it  great!!!  You hear very clear every word also play my I Tunes  I am very satisfied withMy Bluetooth speaker. My husband is so impressed he is thinking about buying one for his car.This product is well worth the money.
5	1381795200	I read some of the negative reviews and can see why people are complaining. It is because the don't understand very much about bluetooth and FM. You have to try a lot of stations before you find one that works in your area. You may have to change the station if you drive very far because you will enter the transmission range of new stations. Play around a little bit to find the sweet spot. You may not find one if you have loads of FM stations where you live. The bluetooth is not going to disconnect until you are out of range, period. That's how all bluetooth connections work. If you are near the car turn off the speakerphone with the switch.I think it is a really good speakerphone and I love the speed at which it connects when I get in the truck.Take a little time to tune in the FM and you will enjoy yours as well.
2	1381795200	People who are talking to me are  complaining about the noise and the poor quality sound.I bought Jabra Tour as well and seems to be better.
5	1381622400	This thing works like a charm...If your car does not have blue tooth this is a perfect item to buy.  It DOES automatically turn on and off.  Just make sure to turn your phone's blue tooth on and it will connect.  The battery life is very long.The volume is great... No one can tell i am talking while driving even when i hear slight wind noise while cruising down the highway.It works very well with two phones connected, switching between them as the manual says it would.This product does an awesome job feeding through the FM channel, much better than any FM channel feeder I've ever used.  My only problem with the FM feeder is it changes the sound coming out to a more flat sound.  But if you are not into extremely high quality sound, you may not notice.
5	1381622400	After installing a JVC KW-HDR81BT CD receiver in my wife&#8217;s Dodge Magnum, and a JVC Arsenal KD-AHD75BT in my Dodge Ram, it became blatantly clear that my 2005 Jaguar Super V8&#8217;s entertainment center wasn&#8217;t in the same league with today&#8217;s sound systems. Mine you, the Jag&#8217;s sound system was &#8216;state-of-the-art&#8217; in 2005, the golden age of the CD.The 2005 Super V8 was built as a limo, with the Queen in mind. The back seat incorporates a plethora of sources to choose what is being piped throughout the cabin. Strangely enough, the driver doesn&#8217;t have as many options, but has ultimate control over the use of the entertainment system.In my quest to bring the 2005 Jag&#8217;s entertainment system on par with the Magnum and Ram, I wanted to enhance, but not compromise an already excellent sound system. In order to do this, the addition of Bluetooth, for hands free calling and streaming; along with the ability to play MP3 files was prominent on my short-list. I wanted a solution that would require minimum effort, but return the greatest &#8216;bang for the buck&#8217;.After an extensive period of research and testing I settled on two units that proved more than adequate:The Jabra Freeway[...]and . . .The Satechi Soundfly AUX[...]Both units were inexpensive and exceeded my expectations. My goal was achieved without compromising, or turning a screw on the Jag. I am totally pleased with this &#8216;plug n play&#8217; solution, and would recommend these products without reservation.** This post was written without harming a Jag . . .
5	1381536000	Wish the radio connection was stronger. Other than that very clear voice. String Bluetooth signal from more than 30'. Buy it!
5	1381449600	Works excellently, good understandable sound.  Easy to use.  I had never used Bluetooth before, so had to learn usage, but only took two calls and I had it down.  Only problem is that my garage is just outside my kitchen, and it will stay connected unless I turn it off.  Not a big deal though/
4	1381276800	Awesome car kit with cool features - voice recognition, dual phone connect, clear sounds etc.Likes - ease of installation and use, clarity in sound, auto on and off in the car, battery lifeNot so likes - voice recognition could be better, it sometimes rejects calls when I say 'answer'Totally worth it at its price... if you don't have a in-car BT system, worth trying this one.Haven't tried the FM transmitter function yet though.
4	1381190400	This works very well with my phone. It is amazing the clarity of how well we can be heard, and how well we can hear others. When the battery gets low it doesn't seem to understand voice instructions, which simply tells me it is time to plug in the charger.
4	1381190400	Much clearer than my previous Motorola Roadster but Roadster app to link with phone and fm transmitter far superior. The Freeway has an excellent speaker for both talking and streaming. Voice Assist free subscription is completely useless. Calls come in clear and other parties can hardly tell that I am on speakerphone.
5	1381104000	In Maryland, we recently had our laws change so that mobile phone use and seat belt violations are prima facie offenses. Being a traveler to Washington, D.C. for business, I've managed to NOT be pulled over there, but now that my entire state does the same thing, I needed to come up with a solution for long stints in my car while still handling client phone calls and text messages. (I'm not one who likes Bluetooth ear pieces, etc.)On a few of my business trips, I rented Ford vehicles with "Microsoft Sync" included in the onboard packages. I absolutely LOVED the way my phone interacted with that system and responded to my voice. It made trips safer, IMHO, and also kept me from being dinged with fines and points on my license. Plus, using the AT&T; Navigator application on my phone (provided by TomTom) through the system eliminated the need for a separate GPS device stuck to the windshield.So... my goal was to find a device that let me have as much of this functionality as I could get. The nice thing about Windows Phone is that you "pretty much" have all of the Sync voice functionality already built-in at SETTINGS | SPEECH. Once enabled, your phone will sound and behave just like the familiar Microsoft Sync system in those newer Fords.NOT being an Apple device fan, it's pretty apparent to me that there is a lack in the marketplace for anything specifically designed for Windows Phone. So, I went to the official Windows Phone website and looked over the devices they recommended and offered. This led me to the Jabra Freeway.First, the Jabra Freeway is by no means a large and clunky device. Rather, it has a sleek design and the button areas for the functions are intelligently placed and blue LED lit. I wondered how much tension the visor clip had because I was concerned that it might drop off of my visor and make me nuts while driving... No worries there! They, also intelligently, made it a VERY stiff clip so there's virtually no chance of that happening.The speakers are very loud and clear and the built-in microphone is sensitive enough to discriminate your voice over ambient sounds. When using the Windows Phone speech features, you are prompted when to answer, etc... so, you are stepped through what to do and have little room for mistake. (Plus, the voice recognition algorithm is scary-accurate.)At first, I thought maybe I didn't need to mess with the VoiceAssist system used by Jabra, but since you get one year of it free included with the purchase, I gave it a whirl. It works by calling their system via your phone... then answers in a very "Microsoft Sync" fashion. There's a bit of an annoyance with setting that feature up through their website and then exporting your contacts to the system... but, if you can dump your data to a CSV file, you'll be fine. The reason I have stuck with VoiceAssist thus far is that unlike the Microsoft Sync systems in those Ford vehicles, I haven't figured out how to "trigger" my phone to listen for a command. The Sync equipped Fords have a steering wheel or dash-mounted button to do this. The Jabra doesn't (at least not as I've discovered yet) do that. This is where VoiceAssist comes into play and works very well. So, if I specifically want to call someone in my contact list, I tap the VoiceAssist button and it dials out, answers, and then I simply tell it to call whoever or send a message, etc. For incoming calls and texts, Microsoft's Speech Services does everything, using the Jabra as a Bluetooth speakerphone, responding extremely quickly by answering a call, reading back a text, letting me reply, ignore or whatever. There is virtually no discernible lag or anything like that and signal quality is perfect.All-in-all, Jabra does Bluetooth the right way and they've done some serious thinking to make this device seemingly flawless. For that alone, Windows Phone users should get this thing if they need this kind of solution because of changing laws or for just some added safety and convenience. You won't find that you bought a device targeting Apple or Android and you just "deal with not having everything" function-wise. Your Windows Phone does everything with this Jabra Freeway.
5	1381017600	Clear,adjustable sound. and I can even use it to connect my  audio media on my tablet to my car sterio without wires. A quality product that I also use as a very loud speaker phone in my home. Very long battery life...
5	1381017600	I spent considerable time reviewing comments before buying this unit.  I have been very pleased with this Bluetooth unit.  Sound quality is very good.  Battery life has been exceptional.  My friends and clients have had no trouble hearing me.  Plus I love that I can move this unit from one vehicle to another with ease.
5	1381017600	I purchased this just before leaving on a 4 hour trip.  This product allowed me to talk as I was driving while keeping both hands on the wheel.  I was able to easily hear the people I was speaking with, and they had no difficulty understanding me.  I am able to go quite a while between charges, and like the that this unit tells me when the battery is low.
4	1380931200	Machine operates very well.  Good speakers and good microphone. Sometimes is does not recognize my voice commands and seems to default to redial.
4	1380844800	Still wish the FM receiver was stronger.  It's nice to run it through your stereo - but if the receiver is weak and can't adequately promote the signal, it kind of defeats the purpose.  Everything else is excellent!
3	1380758400	The Freeway works perfectly with my android.  My only complaint is I was hoping to use my auto speakers using the FM transmitter feature. Maybe it is my stereo that is the problem but this feature is useless in my car.  I've tried every frequency available and the best was very poor.Using the Freeway speaker is flawless -- my wife says I come in clear and I can hear her perfectly.  Again, I stream iHeart Radio and was hoping this would go to my auto speakers but for now I have to settle for the Freeway speaker.
5	1380672000	Perfect for everything it's meant for.Great sound and fit. Very reliable connection every time. All buttons are easy to operate.
2	1380672000	I got the unit due to some of the features line music via the FM on the car radio, well that bombed, the unit can not find a clean FM friq. to use.As for calls, 4 of 5 people hate the sound of it when I call them, one will not talk to me if I use it.The Commands that you have to speak take a lot of getting use to, "Phone Commands" "What Can I Say". and heaven forbid you have the AC on high or the window down the unit can not understand what you are saying due to the noise.The unit seems to go to sleep, if I take a call the handset rings 3-4 times before I hear it in the Jabra unit.Maybe I have a bad unit, maybe I just don't get it, but after paying $80 for it, I regret getting it and should have picked the BlueAnt unit I was eyeing also.Update- The unit is not working right, I say "Phone Commands" and it plays music... hahaha No kidding it really plays music and does not take me to my phone so I can call, and if 1 of 12 times it does work it gets the names wrong... I speak english and have no accent or slur. It is turning out to be a very costly mistake. I must have a lemon and don't know if I can get it fixed, until I do get it fixed. save your money and buy something different......
4	1380672000	great hands free devise.  talks to me and addresses who is calling when incoming call.  calls come in clear, people on other end do not know I am talking through a devise.
4	1380672000	Great product and the volume is louder than expected. The line on the other side is clearly heard and vice versa.
3	1380672000	Yup, it works, but its a little fussy and sometimes requires voice commands to be repeated more than I expected.
5	1380326400	I found the Freeway to be 100 times better than any bluetooth earpiece I've had, which have been many. The call clarity is fantastic. There is no problem with the caller and I overtalking each other. I bought it for my corvette, which has nonstock exhaust (louder than normal). I have no problem hearing or understanding the caller. I plan on buying one to use in my camry. I have recommended it to a friend of mine, who intends to buy at least one.
5	1380240000	It works like a charm. It warns u when it is low battery, and easy to operate. Continuous talking time is reliable.
3	1380153600	I haven't fully use the system to give it a sufficent rating. I need more time to truly test it out. It looks like the picture and arrived within threes days of placing the order. It looks great, it seems sturdy and well made. So far I don't have any complaint, but I haven't used it enough to give it a true rating.I will update at a later date after regular use of the system.
5	1379980800	Love this unit makes driving easier and the sound coming out of it is very good love that you can listen to music through your car speakers using this device would recommend this to anyone
4	1379980800	I would've given 5 start had it played my Pandora through my radio like my old Jabra did. It didn't seem to connect as well to the radio as my earlier Jabra model did so that was a little disappointing. Other than that, the Freeway works great as a speakerphone. The sound is good and I had no trouble connecting my phone to it and my GPS application on my phone works with it very well. I love the truly hands free feature. When someone calls, it tells the name of the person instead of just the number like my earlier version of Jabra and I can tell it to answer or ignore which is really cool. I don't have to take my eyes off the road and in California, at rush hour, that is really important!
4	1379894400	The biggest selling point for me was with the Jabra Freeway you could have two Bluetooth devises connected and turned on but not used at the same time. I wanted to use it to play music from my iPod Touch 5G but have the cell phone turned on while driving in case I get a call. It was easy to pair both devises but anytime both were turned on, it was like it was constantly toggling between them and was useless. Plus, voice commands didn't work half the time even with only the iPod Touch turned on and in use. Jabra customer service said their firmware update should solve my problems and to download the update from their website. Only problem is, their firmware updates are only available as an .exe file and cannot be opened on a Mac. I was about ready to return the Jabra for a refund when I found a free program called Winebottler that can convert .exe files into a usable format for Macs. It worked. It opened up immediately with Winebottler with the process to install the firmware automatically on a PC but had instructions on which buttons to push to get the Jabra to install it if it didn't do it automatically. I can now have both the Cell Phone and my iPod Touch turned on at the same time and if I am playing music from the iPod Touch through the Jabra and I get a call, the music stops and the Jabra announces an incoming call. When the call ends, the music starts back up again just like advertised. With millions of Mac users around the world, I cannot understand why Jabra doesn't provide their firmware updates in a format for Mac users. I usually play my Jabra through the FM transmitter and it works beautifully in my small town. When I am driving in a large city with lots of stations, I switch to the Jabra's own stereo speakers which actually sound pretty good. The voice commands have also worked perfectly since I was able to install the firmware update.
4	1379808000	Great speaker, FM transmitter useless. If youre near to car it will stay connected like others said.  Overall great device.
5	1379808000	I wish I would of gotten this sooner. It is a great time saver I no longer have to pull over to answer or make a call or miss it all together.
5	1379548800	Better than I expected and in Illinois you have to have this to talk on the phone without pulling over.Text, phone, receive calls and text and also read and respond to emails.  Love it.
3	1379462400	Since I have purchased this Jabra Freeway Bluetooth Speakerphone, I have had nothing but issues with it. If I call someone on their land line, after 3 minutes of talking I loose communication with that person. If I stay on the phone because we do not get disconnected, just cannot talk for about 1.5 minutes then they come back. Then after less then a minute they are gone again. The same thing happens if I call and talk with someone from another cell phone, after a minute into the conversation we can no longer communicate until they come back. The Jabra is brand new and I feel it should not do this. When I sync up to the car radio, the radio station still keeps coming through and I cannot talk to them through the radio as the manual said it should be able to. I am giving this product three stars and I feel that is too many stars. When I had the Motorola bluetooth speakerphone I could sync to the radio and I was able to speak with the person on the other side without any issues.
3	1379462400	The volume control needs more volume increments.  It was either too loud or too soft in the volume.  Also people would tell me that the conversation would sound jittery or a little broken up.  I thought that was from a weak signal but I had 5 bars and so did they so it was not a signal issue.  I usually pumped the sound through FM on the radio, this worked very well.
5	1379376000	My father in law loves this. I got a new car with bluetooth (honda civic) and I loved the handsfree dialing and calling feature. I thought this would make a great gift for someone without that feature and I was right. I guess you do have to click the button so it is not completely handfree but it works great.
5	1379289600	Great unit, delivers perfect audio connections every time. Easy to set up, easy to use. I highly recommend this product.
5	1379030400	I ordered this device based on other positive reviews here for my husband's 2001 Lexus RX350 which is not equipped with an aux jack and this has filled the bill nicely.  He paired the phone right out of the box and we charged the unit using the USB and he was whizzing down the driveway receiving handsfree calls within 2 hours.  Awesome.  He loves it.  Make sure you allow the device to go through all the prompts before you respond to answer a call.  He is working on the voiceassist feature, but overall, I give this 5 stars because the clarity is very good.
5	1379030400	I did like it very much this product so I do recomend it to every body to connect with the phone
5	1378944000	My husband loves it. Perfect for his long driving trips away from home. Now we can keep in touch legally on all his drives.
5	1378857600	This is an excellent hands free device to use in the car or anywhere you need them. Excellent sound quality and easy to use.
3	1378771200	Nice product, but it doesn't work with my Samsung S3 without buying a subscription for voice commands. My research didn't indicate there would be an issue. Consequently the product doesn't operate as instructed & I have to run through a long process of commands to make a call.
1	1378598400	Not worth the money. Bought it as a gift to get my bf from talking on the phone while driving. It does not phase out the background noise, so traffic noise is loud. Too much static. Too expensive and we don't use it at all.
4	1378425600	The speakers are definitely loud enough even over the drone of a serrated highway. Frequently the Jabra does not respond correctly to the commands and this can be irksome at highway speeds.
5	1378339200	Luv it! It surpasses all of my expectations. Everyone who rides in my car wants it for their! Go buy it now!
4	1378252800	I bought the Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone to listen to audiobooks in my car, and for using it for placing calls with my iPhone.  I had to send the first one I received back because the audio microphone was flawed.  The replacement worked fine.  The audio is nice and loud and even a relatively quiet audio book is audible with road noise in the background.I like how the Jabra FREEWAY auto connects when I get in the car.  It has some kind of motion sensor, probably sensing the vehicle shaking as I step in.  The noise cancelling microphone seems to work well.  The audio has a nice base response compared to other bluetooth speakers I've used.In summary, I'm happy with it and it works well.
5	1378252800	I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. I have tried many many bluetooths and this one is by far the best one ever. Love it!!!!!!!!!
4	1378080000	Very nice product, works and sets up easily. Would recommend to friends who are interested in hands free in the car.
4	1377993600	So far, so good.  The best thing is the volume.  I can actually hear it! I have not used the hands free yet but so far, I am happy.
5	1377993600	Researched this type of device for over a year. After intensive 'cyber study' I purchased one for my vehicle. So pleasantly surprised that I purchased one for my wife after only two weeks. Key note: bring the device inside to charge it every week or two. Like any speaker phone it still has its quarks. Technology still needs to develop.
5	1377907200	We purchased this for my husband who drives a semi.  I can hear a little background noise when we talk, but it isn't too bad.  He says he can hear me good.  We purchased a different speakerphone previously to this one and it was terrible.  He had to clip it on the steering wheel in order for me to hear him talk.
1	1377820800	Jabra packed all the fancy features anyone would want into this speakerphone - but guess what. You can't use it to voice dial phone calls unless you pay premium dollars equaling the cost of a brand new unit for their annual &#34;Voice Assist&#34; subscription. What a rip off! Right out of the box you can't use it to make a call - just answer one. If doesn't bother you to pay an additional sixty bucks a year to use a speakerphone that you already own then this might be for you. But then you might as well just throw the old piece of junk in the trash when the free subscription runs out and buy a brand new one on Amazon for the same price as a subscription renewal. I'm returning mine ASAP so I can buy another that actually works for hands free phone calls, and it definitely won't be a Jabra!
5	1377820800	Since getting this device I have been compliant with the state's cell phone laws and enjoy pandora while driving. I've shared the device with my sister and she was just as excited as I was to use it.  Thanks
4	1377734400	As a school administrator who has to supervise several itinerant teachers I needed a wireless device to keep in contact while on the road.  The Jabra Bluetooth Speakerphone syncs both by district phone and my personal cell phone at the same time (very cool!).  The Jabra Bluetooth Speakerphone was ready to go after two hours of charging.  The only hang ups I have experienced has been the occasion dropped bluetooth signal and it occasionally restarts on it's own.  Other than that, it has been just wonderful.
5	1377648000	I had the BlueAnt S4... hated it, never used it, got 2 cell phone tickets.Two reasons why I hated the BlueAnt S4 and why I love the Jabra FREEWAY:- It's loud enough to where you can actually hear people while driving on the freeway! BlueAnt had the smallest little speaker that was absolutely useless on the freeway.- it auto connects when you get into the car, so you literally just turn this on once and forget about it. With the BlueAnt, I had to turn it off and then turn it on EVERY TIME I got into the car to connect it with my phone.- The radius in which the Jabra connects with your phone is exactly what it should be; not much more than 5-10 feet. The BlueAnt radius was at least 30 feet because I'd be in the house, someone would call me, and my phone was still connected to the stupid BlueAnt in my car!Do yourself a favor and buy the Jabra FREEWAY.
4	1377475200	This unit appears to work well with the exception of one item, and that is when I am talking to people they hear a soundmuch like gurgling water in the back ground. I have only had it one week so I have not tried all the other options available.
5	1377388800	I bought the Jabra Freeway for hand free phone use and the FM feature. I read the reviews  and decided to give this one a try. I have a 4S i phone and an older truck that doesn't have a radio with an i pod connection. The set up was so simple. You charge up the battery turn it on and It basically sets itself up. The Jabra Freeway tells you what it is doing and then you are up and running. I have taken and made calls from it and my friends tell me they can tell I am in the truck but the sound quality is good.
5	1377216000	I purchased this because I sold my new car with lots of new technology and bought an older cheaper used car.  With the Jabra Freeway, I don't miss the new technology at all.  My phone connects with Jabra without any difficulty - couldn't say the same for my Ford Sync.  No one has complained about being able to hear me, as they did constantly with the Ford Sync.  It plays beautifully through my FM stereo (XM app, Audible, Pandora, and my music), and it answers my calls.  This is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.
2	1377216000	I have used other bluetooth speakers before, but this one is the worse. I am not at all happy with the sound quality.
3	1377216000	Sound quality through speaker and FM is lacking.Pairing is simple, microphone works well in all conditions.Cannot turn down announcement volume when you access controls.
5	1376784000	This is the second one I bought (for the second car) since we love the first one. Very loud (if needed) and the automatic on/off sensing works perfectly everytime. Great battery life as well...
5	1376611200	Past bluetooth speakerphones I used in my car were not worth trying.  I lost faith in this type of product.  That is until I started using this one, the Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone.  Holy cow, it has great sound quality. I can hear it clearly and those I call hear it well.  Easy to use and makes up for the fact that my 2010 car is lacking bluetooth.  It's worth the money!!!
4	1376524800	This is probably one of the better high-end Bluetooth speakerphones. The sound quality is excellent. The auto-connect feature and voice commands work great. But CAUTION -- this device may not work with your phone! We went through THREE phones before finding one that was compatible! Even though Jabra said our first two phones would be compatible, they were not. Do NOT buy this device for the LG Revere or LG Revere 2 flip phones! These phones will power cycle and then disconnect each incoming call. We tested this with another Freeway device, and different Revere phones, and got the same results. Jabra is still trying to figure out why, and will e-mail us its research. Meanwhile, we bought a Samsung Brightside that works just fine with the Freeway. If you can, TEST your phone with the Jabra Freeway at a retail store BEFORE you buy this device!
5	1376352000	Great hands free device. Highly recommended. I've used it for over 1 month with no problems. Every function is easy to use.
5	1376352000	Love this! Very easy to set up. Seems to be pretty clear for others to hear me. I would recommend to others.
5	1376006400	Arrived when promised with easy to understand instructions. Works great and has great sound, makes for safe cell phone use while driving.
5	1375833600	I am extremely pleased with the Jabra Freeway.  I have a mini Cooper Convertible, and am using the Freeway in  that vehicle.  I unpackaged it, charged it (pretty quickly) and popped it my visor for a morning commute.  It then did everything it said it would; auto-connected, voice commands, FM broadcasting (normally has failed with any other product FM saturated airways of New England),.  Volume works with the top down so that I can rock out, and a phone call confirmed that I could have a phone conversation in my convertible.!  Advice-its a fully recommended buy!
5	1375833600	I'm very satisfied with this purchase.  It is crystal clear absolutely no static or interference.  I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it not only does she use it in the car but in our home.  The music or phone conversation can be very loud, great volume.  It is louder than my mac book pro!  Great product definitely worth the purchase.
4	1375747200	We like the Jabra especially for listening to our music from our phone.  The speakers sound very good.  We do not use it daily so we have trouble remembering the voice commands.  When using it for a phone calls, we have had people say that it sounds like we are talking in a tin can.  We able to connect both phones at the same time.  I do not know what would happen if we got another phone call while using it with the other phone because it hasn't happened yet.  I would recommend this product for those that wish to listen to music or talk hands free.
5	1375488000	This is my 4th speakerphone I have purchased. Of the four this one is the best by far. It did break a connection while I was parked and talking to someone, but only a minor problem since I normally use it while rolling. There maybe someway to over ride that situation that I am not aware of.
4	1375488000	We use this in our older minivan that does not have a built in bluetooth connection. It works great and when in use the listener cannot distinguish this from an automatic connection. The only frustration is that it can connect as you are approaching your vehicle using the phone which makes the speaking parties think they have been disconnected.
3	1375401600	Have had a few issues that seem to relate to heat when closed in the vehicle on a warm day.  Verbal commands didn't work until unit cooled off.  Also sometimes it takes a while to dis-connect after exiting the vehicle in the garage (had to go out and manually turn off).  When everything is working right it is a great product.
3	1375315200	I like the features likes hands free answering, 3 speaker system, and the level of volume but the voice commands are hit or miss. It fits over my visor but I perfer to keep it next to me since the sun will make the visor to go down causing the Freeway to face outward toward the window. I aslo enjoy listening to pandora using the device as a personal speaker system.
4	1375228800	This speakerphone is mostly great! It has a lot of cool features and is pretty easy to learn how to use, though I don't recommend trying to figure it out while driving.  Definitely practice at home first!  The sound quality is excellent, both in how I hear callers in the car, and in how they report hearing me. Playing songs and podcasts from my iPhone through it also worked great on a recent roadtrip.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that when the device is clipped to the sunshade visor in the down position, the visor cannot be raised.  And if it's clipped to the visor when the visor is raised, then it can't be lowered.  At least this is the case in my car (Toyota Corolla).  I find that I'm surviving okay with this inconvenience, though.
5	1374969600	I have never bothered to submit a review before.I decided to go hands free for two reasons.1- it was becoming illegal to talk and drive in too many places2- I found myself taking my focus off the road while trying to dial at the same time.The Jabra Freeway unit is convenient and easy to use.  It has excellent sound quality, with or without my hearing aids in.I strongly recommend this unit
3	1374969600	Only complaints are that has to be re-paired with my android phone frequently, and the owner's instructions are very skimpy (still haven't figured out how to sync with my car's FM radio).
5	1374883200	Product is solid and works great.  I have a deep voice but it sounds clear on the Jabra Freeway. I would recommend it to my friends.
3	1374883200	I've had for the past year. Great for hands-free, works with Siri okay, and it has a long battery life. But people say that they I cannot hear me well and pick up a lot of background noise
4	1374883200	Product works well and unit audio quality is very good.  Glad I paid the extra $ for Freeway which has better speakers.FM transmission to radio has a lot of annoying static and changing stations doesn't help.  If you plan to transmit music to the radio, expect static; especially when mobile..
4	1374796800	Works well for what I needed. It will play music from my iPhone also, plus use it for phone calls. It is loud enough.
4	1374796800	Sound is adequate for car/light truck use but trying to utilize this in farm machinery and the audio doesn't do as good of job as we expected in noise cancellation/filtering.
4	1374710400	I bought this because my new Nokia Lumia 920 did not fully function with my 2006 car's Bluetooth system. I was unable to hear navigation directions from the phone. The Jabra fixed that and added the ability to stream music and podcasts from the phone.The device itself feels solidly built and is not particularly obtrusive when clipped to the visor on the driver side. The design is attractive and it does not cheapen the look of the car. It comes with a car power tap and long cord for charging in the car. It was very easy to pair with my phone (although a couple of times I have had to re-pair).The most important feature for me is audio playback quality. The built-in speakers are excellent for spoken voice recordings, which are the podcasts I ususally list to. Music playback is adequate, but lacks the impact of the car system. On that point, the Jabra lets you broadcast to a vacant FM station and listen to the audio through the car system. That works moderately well. Here in Chicago there is not a lot of open space on the FM dial. While driving around the suburbs, I found I had to change the station often to get good playback.A great feature is that I can use all the voice commands that operate my phone. Pressing the phone button on the Jabra lets me access the phone's system. Incoming text messages are announced, read, and I can respond by voice. I can also use voice commands to answer or ignore incoming calls.I have not spent a lot of time making calls using the Jabra. The calls I have made have gone smoothly without any complaints about clarity on the receiving end.Overall, this is a great product that solved my specific problems. Except for a few pairing glitches, it works great.
2	1374624000	You have to pay extra to get voice commands which was not explained before purchasing. Information was misleading. This was one of the main reasons I bought this. Not worth  it for the money.
5	1374278400	Easy to use, long battery life, clear at any volume. Bought it for work and have had no problems at all
5	1374192000	This is just what I was looking for.  It connects to my phone without any issues.  Other models always have problems connecting.  The volume is very loud and I can don't have any issues in hearing conversations while in noisy places.
5	1374192000	Amazing product!!It has a long life duration (it took almost 1 month for me to charge it)The sound is very clear and audible! thisis a must!
4	1374019200	The Jabra Freeway makes phone calls easier. You often have to repeat yourself for commands. Have not tried out many of the other functions such as email etc. Hoping the other functions work as well as the calling.
2	1373932800	I chose this for a truck driving friend who needed a hands-free device to use while driving.  I thought this would be best due to it not needing to be attached to his head or ear.  It was nice to not have the device on one's head or ear, but that was really the only plus to using this device.We both tried the device in different locations.  He used it in his truck and I tried it in the house with no outside noise and we both had trouble with the device understanding our commands.  We tried the free one-year subscription that comes with the device and that is supposed to make using the device easier, but that did not help.I do not know if our device was faulty or if it was just us so I returned the device and purchased a VXI BlueParrott B250-XT+ and that has worked perfectly.
1	1373760000	May as well just use the speakerphone.  Actually, it's MUCH more a pain to use then my phone.  Too many steps t place a call.  Doesn't recognize voice well, sound is horrible.  Plain junk. The address book function is totally useless.
4	1373587200	I was impressed by the battery life, after the first overnight charge, the low battery notification came up after 25 days! This is with low to moderate voice usage, and mostly iPhone audio connection such as typing or notification sounds. I really do love having notification sounds come through the loud speaker so I know when I get a text or call while driving even with loud music or windows down. It's easy to talk to people and there are no call audio issues. The speaker quality is OK, as it gets distorted at the loudest setting. I've always hated BT headsets, so this is a winner!
5	1373587200	Perfect for my limited use of cell phone technology. I recommend this product to anyone who doesn't have blue tooth tech in there vehicle.
3	1373414400	This product works very well except that outgoing voice quality is poor.  As a note, receiving call voices are good.
4	1373414400	I have used other speaker phones and this one definitely has the best sound quality of any I have tried. As best as I can tell, the people I am talking to can hear me OK as well.I have been gun shy about clicking the button to answer a call: the one time I tried, I disconnected the caller. That may have been my issue alone!Have not used any of the other features.
5	1373328000	With the new laws in place and the safety issues cell phones are causing, it should be mandatory that hands free devices are used in cars.  This unit works quite well and we are safer for using it every day
3	1373241600	As car kit it is perfect and very smart I really like very much but as FM transmitter really not good all the time while hearing music the sound quality is really bad
4	1372982400	So, I've had this for about 6-9 mos now. I've lost track. While I don't use it MUCH, just 'cause I don't get many calls in general and only a small percentage of those come in while driving, it is rather handy.I'm not all that familiar with some of the more advanced features, but for the basics it's pretty easy. There's an on/off switch on the side. I tend to turn it on when  get in and usually turn it off when I get out. But if I don't, it has a standby type mode and will "power on" when the phone gets back into range after standby. The thing seems to have ample standby time between recharges. With my relatively infrequent usage, I only just recently had to recharge it for the first time. Again, I don't use it all that much and when I do the conversations tend to be fairly brief (pre-paid phone, don't want to waste minutes), so the battery lasted the better part of 6-9 mos on a single charge (intermittent short usage & turning it off when not in the car). I'm pretty happy with that. Recharging only took about an hour and I'm sure it'll go another 6-9 mos between charges again. You can either plug it in to the USB port on a computer to recharge, or it has a cigarette lighter adapter to recharge from the car battery.In theory it's also got some voice activated commands you can use, but I never really learned them. And I think you have to hit the "voice" button or something first before it will start recognizing its limited set of commands. So, on that front it's not quite perfect. Also, the button at the front of it for picking up or ending calls lights up. But the other buttons don't, which can make it hard to accurately press them in the dark. Also, I noticed that occasionally if I was going to press the end call button and the other person hung up first and the call ended before I got to my end call button, it would instead start a new call and call back the last person dialed and I'd have to hurriedly hang up again and hope they didn't think I needed something and call me back. Awkward... Also, there were a few times where I had my phone on in my pocket but forgot to turn on the unit before a call came in. So I hurriedly turned the unit on. Now, I think that when the phone is ringing and the unit is turned on at that point and connects to the phone it automatically picks up (maybe not always?). So, I think there was one time where I turned on the unit while the phone was ringing, didn't realize it had picked up the call, I went to hit the "start call" button and accidentally hung up on them instead. Oops.So, it has its quirks. Voice activation isn't perfect or terribly advanced, I think? Not that it needs to be for my purposes, since my phone isn't "smart" just a regular dumb Samsung TradFone slider w/bluetooth.Call quality is okay. Sometimes it's a little "grainy" / staticky. But I can't tell if it's the connection on my end, the other person's end or the unit itself. Most of the time call quality seems adequate, so I'm thinking maybe it's just the connection/reception while driving or a problem with the caller's reception... Hard to say. Generally it's fine though. Seems a tad bit o nthe expensive side, given you can generally get a headset for about $30-50. But it does pretty well, so I'm not complaining too much...Overall, I like it. It has utility and gets done the job I need it to get done which is just basic hand-free talk while driving (since talking w/o a hands-free device will get you a ticket in my area, maybe the whole state).
1	1372982400	Did NOT operate from the box,after waiting over a half hour on the telephone waiting to talk to India, had to download new software and sill does not work right.
3	1372896000	Wanted to be able to stream music to it without having to get a new car stereo or ripping up the car.  It's not really meant for music so the quality of the sound when streaming music is tinny.  But I loved the way it mounted to the car visor and the way it turns itself on and off when it senses the iphone getting into the car with you.  So I tried the phone speaker function, which is what it is really designed for.  It sounds good on your end, but I called my home phone to see what it sounded like on the other rise as a microphone and I couldn't even hear the test.  So I had to return it.
4	1372809600	I wear hearing aids so the in the ear bluetooths dont work for me.  I ordered this because several others haven't worked so well for me.  I plugged in it after charging and found it work well,* Voice Incoming Quality: very good* Voice outgoing - some people said I sounded better than my smart phoneI would recommend it based on two weeks, so much  easier than trying to hold it up to my ear.Hopefully update later after a few more weeks.
5	1372723200	I feel much safer now driving and talking on the phone hands free with the Jabra. It works great! Thanks
2	1372723200	Glad I bought from Amazon so I have an easy return. One of the three speakers blew after less then two weeks. Now not loud enough to hear at highway speeds. I purchased to use with Audible and listen to books, so very surprised it failed.
5	1372636800	I use this with my personal android phone and my work iphone. Works great on both devices paired at the same time. I don't have the app installed on my phone.Phone commands works with iphone, it's basically a shortcut to Siri, so you could also use it to text or anything Siri does.Phone commands on my galaxy nexus s does nothing, so that's a bummer, but it's the phone's fault.Speaker and Mic are fantastic, they even work well with the windows open (at 30mph) or with the radio on at a modest level.Battery life is great on this thing, I try to charge it once a week on my 20 minute drive in to work, hasn't died yet!If you hate getting calls while driving with your phone in your pocket, or even in the console, this is for you! The sound on this is waaaay better than using speaker phone feature, not to mention safer because it's less distracting because you can pickup or ignore the call ** hands free **
4	1372636800	We bought this for my dad for fathers day.  In California they can't talk on the phone unless it is handsfree.  This was a great solution.  It was easy to set up and we were able to use it almost immediately.  Once you learn 3-4 phrases you are good to go and can access your phone easily, make and receive calls, listen to text messages, use handsfree, and broadcast your phone over your radio.  The only complaint is when the girl on the machine talks it is really loud and we couldn't figure out how to lower her voice.
5	1372636800	Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone is very good tool for driver. it is very easy to use and I like it.
5	1372204800	Was able to sync with my iPhone 4S straight out of the box. Opted to not subscribe to Voice Assist as the Bluetooth works easily with Siri by simply pushing the "home" button on my phone. Love being able to stream my favorite station through the Jabra!
5	1372118400	This product rocks!! Hands down, no pun intended, the best Bluetooth/hands free product on the market!! I would highly recommend it!
1	1371772800	I really wanted to like this speakerphone, because the audio quality is actually very good for a speakerphone; however, that's about all that's good, as I found the product to be unreliable and customer support is just terrible.The marketing suggests this product can handle a lot of commands by voice recognition, but the product itself only recognizes a very small set of commands (16) and the rest, such as calling a person in a Contact list, is handled either by your cellphone's voice control functionality or by a 3rd-party service called VoiceAssist that requires an annual subscription and uses your plan's airtime.  The speakerphone itself is actually terrible at recognizing the few commands it's supposed to, as I found myself randomly calling someone back, listening to music on my phone, or listening to silence instead of what I was actually trying to do.  Also, the device wouldn't recognize any commands whatsoever if I tried using it with the micro-usb charge cable plugged in.  I thought maybe it was just my voice it didn't like, but my wife and others had about the same success as I did.Even more annoying is the fact that when it thinks you've said an invalid command, which is almost always, the voice guidance kicks in to tell you the commands that you're supposed to be able to say AT THE SPEAKER'S HIGHEST VOLUME, which cannot be adjusted.  If you think that you can simply turn off voice guidance, well unfortunately, some genius decided that doing so should turn off voice recognition too!Actually, I ended up trying 2 separate units before returning both, as the first one I received stopped working after 3 days and wouldn't do anything but play a musical tone when you pushed any of the buttons.  I did get the chance to use it before it stopped working, but the results were the same as the second unit I tried.  Customer Support itself is terrible and is available only by email from Jabra and they seem to only provide FAQ answers.Overall, four stars for the call quality, but minus 3 stars for terrible voice recognition, virtually non-existent support, and trying to scam customers into a subscription service to take advantage of the voice recognition advertised on the box. Don't waste your time or money on this product.
5	1371772800	The Jabra works better than expected. I have another similar devise and the Jabra way better. Love it for playing music via my speaker in the carTom
5	1371772800	I think this is the way to go, it's better than the ear buds by far.  The speaker is nice and clear works for talk to text as well as listening to anything that is on your phone.  I often put on youtube video with one of my daughters songs and we jam out! GET ONE, BE SAFE ON THE ROAD....
5	1371686400	Good things, the use of down feeling good, and the price is very cheap, hope Amazon continues to launch cheap goodies.
4	1371600000	IT performs well I spend a lot of time traveling it fits well with my routine it automatically turns off when you are about forty feet away from it ,and auto reconnects when back in range
5	1371600000	I like it very much. first it can pair two iphones, and second the voice is very clear, then the automatic pair when shut the door is very good.at last but not least, standby time is quite long.
1	1371513600	I paid too much attention to the glowing 4 and 5 star reviews and should have paid more attention to the others.  This is my 3rd after market Bluetooth device and in my opinion all are near worthless.  Yes they can be hands free but you are still forced to fumble for buttons while you are driving which in itself is very distracting.  And this Jabra Freeway with the Voice Assist free trial is worse than I expected.  I had to keep saying &#34;Voice Assist&#34; over and over again and it would not be recognized.  Thinking maybe the device didn't like my voice I had my wife try.  Same results.  After the 3rd attempt it would say, &#34;sorry try again&#34;.  After many attempts and able to get into Voice Assist where I had spent 30 minutes putting in my contacts it would not recognize most commands on people I wanted it to dial.  I am familiar with what a good system should do as in my other GM car I have the factory installed system which works flawlessly ALL THE TIME.  My advise is to forget these add on systems and either use a hand held phone (when allowed) live with a device you wear in your ear, or wait until you get on factory installed on a car.
4	1371168000	It works very well for the most part. At times people say I sound garbled when I talk over it but I can switch back to my iPhone fairly easily. It pretty much is what is advertised.
4	1370995200	So far I like this, I generally use this for it's FM transmitter/blue tooth so I can stream music from my phone to my stereo. That in mind I wish they had a track advance/skip, pause/stop and play/resume button on them.
1	1370995200	I liked it, but the battery no longer holds a charge (and I don't use it that much). Less than a year old. Don't waste the money.
5	1370736000	This has to be the best speakerphone on the market. I bought one for my wife last Christmas, and my Mother-in-law wanted one for Mother's Day. It's easy to set-up/use. The quality/clearity of the sound is amazing. It's completely hands free, and cable free (except to charge). Every feature in the description is 100% accurate. It even ties into your vehicle's speakers wirelessly through the proper radio station to listen to music stored on your phone.
2	1370476800	This device demonstrated a lot of noise interference while in use.  I found it to be unacceptably bothersome, so I returned it.
5	1370304000	The deivce is easy to operate and works well with any phone.  Pairing the device was simple and the unit will walk you through the process to ensure the device is operating with your phone.  Speaker is clear and reduces the noise as specified.  Overall I am pleased with the product and will encourage anyone to make the investment.
3	1369958400	It is really good device, if you do not need FM transmitter, because it works very bad.I bought it because I need some device to transmit music to car stereo via Bluetooth =&#62; FM transmitter, and FM transmitter in Jabra Freeway works worser than FM transmitter in cheap Chinese no-name FM transmitter for $13, I was really confused.All other - works really nice, so I can advice you to buy it if you need just loud Bluetooth speakerphone with nice UI.
5	1369872000	I have been using this for a few months now, it is by far the best Bluetooth I have used (I have used a lot) i use it a lot as i drive in y car everyday all day.  but it does scare the hell out of me when I open my door in the morning Togo to work and it tells me that my phone is connected.  Love that it connects only when I'm in the car.  My last one would connect while I was in my house which was annoying when I would get a call.People do not know that I am even talking on a Bluetooth when I am speaking to them.  The speakers are great very clear.
4	1369699200	The only problem I've had with it is that sometimes it doesn't disconnect when I go in the house so I have to manually disconnect it or move to a remote part of the house for it to disconnect.  It's very convenient to just get in the car and be connected automatically.
4	1369699200	It works great, but the bulk package does not have the charger. I have to use the charger of my Jabra headset to charge it.
5	1369440000	Bought this for my wife because he vehicle was not equipped with hands free. She used it for six months or so and loved it. She was able to talk hands free as well as the kids could say hello too. When I asked her what she liked about the unit she said it was really nice to listen to her playlist while the kids were watching a movie.  We now have a new vehicle with hands free so now we use it around the house to play music. Another note is that this unit runs for quite awhile between charges. I would recommend this!
4	1369094400	Phone commands: names of people to call are often confused with different names when using the bluetooth, but not when using the handheld phone alone
5	1369008000	Works super well, does everything it's supposed to very well - well, with the exception of the FM transmitter, for some reason it doesnt come in clear. That being said, the speakers are so loud, it's not necessary. My main concern was that it wouldnt be loud enough, and it totally is. It's super sleek and high tech, great product.
5	1368662400	Very pleased with the features and quality of sound. I haven't had any problems with the voice commands. It is reliable and so far it delivers as promised. I highly recommend this item as well as the seller. Smooth transaction and quick delivery.
2	1368576000	I purchased the Jabra Freeway for my daughter, who does most of her communicating during a twenty mile daily commute.  I hoped it would allow her to keep two hands on the steering wheel, and her eyes on the road.  Unfortunately, it does neither.  No matter how clearly you speak  to  it, can't seem to understand who it is you wish call.  Once you manually place the call, Freeway works nicely, but I could have accomplished that for $20, instead of the $99 I paid.
4	1368316800	Love the features on this unit, but really like the audio clarity. I haven't used the radio feature to listen over your speakers in your car, just a little too much to do while driving to switch between that and answering the call. Overall good out of the box car kit ...
4	1368316800	This review is for FW version 1.61.0.I've been using the Jabra Freeway for a year now and find it's best suited for voice calls as well as mono audio, such as podcasts or audio books. The fidelity for music is just not there..so I would not consider this if your primary application is music. Battery life is great, lasting a couple of weeks of daily use (~ 1 hour / day) and charging time is fast. Callers do not complain about the audio quality either, but most can tell I'm on a bluetooth speaker.FM & VoiceAssist: I don't use it.Like others, the voice prompt audio is quite loud but not startling to me. I did have one issue early on that almost caused me to return the device. I had paired it with my iPhone 4 and another Android phone but was constantly getting audio cut-outs last 2-5s when playing audio books or podcasts on the iPhone. No other device paired to the Jabra had this problem - only the iPhone 4 which was the first device paired to the Jabra. I ended up performing a factory reset on the Jabra and it fixed the problem. I no longer pair to any other devices and always do a factory reset if pairing to a new primary device. They do have a newer FW version available, but I have not updated since no changes notes are available.
5	1368144000	This works well in the car. Can also be used as a portable speaker. Good battery life. Overall good product.
5	1368057600	I have owned several other name-brand units over the years, but this is hands-down the very best I have ever purchased and used. It is extremely easy to use and definitely the one to own and use daily.
5	1368057600	Bought this for my wife's vehicle. She loves it since her position is in need of constant contact with the main office. The sound from the small speaker is "Bose-like" in quality. Not tinny sounding. Like coming from the vehicle sound system. PLUS you can have it go through your sound system. Easy to setup and easy to use.Professionally packaging and shipping.
4	1368057600	Its pretty cool. Sure makes driving a lot safer. In fact, its really fun to use. Should be a requirement for each car.
5	1368057600	Chose this device based on other reviews and positive reviews were right-on. The battery lasts long, the clarity is great on  both sides. A bit larger than the other devices, but sleek. Pairing is simply . . . SIMPLE. Love it.
5	1368057600	This product arrived much quicker than I thought it would.  It was so simple to pair with my iPhone.  It works beautifully.  Sound is awesome.  Voices are very clear and it's easy to use.  Haven't used it for music to date.
5	1367971200	Bought this to replace a Jabra that was stolen out of my car. The product works even better than the other model I had. Great sound and quick pairing. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a hands free device for their use.
5	1367539200	It connects VERY easily to any device (cell phone, car bluetooth, etc.), puts out great sound quality, priced right...it's definitely a winner!
5	1367366400	Does all the things you want a Bluetooth device to do, plus it's clear, easy to adjust, low profile so it's not in the way and it holds a charge for a long time because it turns itself off when it senses no movement in the vehicle, very cool.
4	1367107200	I just miss the comands in portuguese and would be perfect with better mic quality to let the people hear me.
3	1366848000	Voice recognition aspect of this item is extremely poor. The hands free aspect is good. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate this item a 5.
3	1366588800	For phone calls it works fine.  The FM transmitter didn't work well in my car, though I think it largely depends on the car.  I didn't expect the small speakers would work well for music, but I was hoping they would work for audio books. That didn't pan out.So it didn't really work out for me.Sigh...
5	1366588800	I have tried to get my wife to use several different earpieces to no avail.  She just won't use them.  I tried using an MP3 cord for through her stereo system but she won't do that cause it's too confusing.  She would have to push the Auxilliary input and it would be a pain in the rear.  She's not tech savvy and doesn't want to be.  So, I wanted something that would be easy plain and simple.  This product is easy and seems to work well. She has only used it for one weekend but the auto-detection motion sensor that automatically connects the phone is an awesome feature.  I had ordered a Cruiser 2 but ordered this one as soon as I found out that the Cruiser 2 didn't have the motion sensor.  My wife probably just wouldn't have used it cause it would have been more difficult.  We'll see how it goes and I'll give updates if it changes but right now we say AWESOME!
4	1366588800	I love this speakerphone!  I drive about 3 hours a day, so an ear piece becomes very uncomfortable fast.  My phone connects automatically and there is an audible message that alerts me.  Another voice command &#34;battery&#34; gives me how many talk hours remain before a charge is required.  The sound in and out are fantastic.
5	1366502400	Stays charged for days and sounds great! It comes on as soon as you sit in your car. Goes as loud as needed!
3	1366416000	It works for the most part but I am constantly saying huh? Had it in a car and a Jeep Cherokee. I have upgraded my radio to Bluetooth and that seems to work better.
5	1366329600	I cannot believe what a great value the Jabra Freeway is.  The sound quality is excellent and it is a perfect mate for my iPhone 5.  It works flawlessly and is well worth the small investment.  The visor clip fits a variety of visors and the car charger cord is long enough to easily route around and out of the way. Battery life has been measured in weeks, not days, which is especially impressive given that I constantly use it to listen to my music and podcasts.  Others have remarked that they didn't even know I was on speakerphone when I've called them.
4	1365984000	I ordered this product and it quickly arrived, which I was happy about. I charged the Bluetooth for 2 hours and I went to my car. I set up the Voice Assistant that comes included with your product then I tried a few calls to test it out and it sounded great on both ends. That same day  I decided to try checking my emails and texting, while driving and it didn't work at all. The Bluetooth has a problem hearing your words, and I was trying to be as clear as possible. After the year is over for the Voice Assistant I don't think I will be renewing this service. It's a shame because I really like the texting feature, and since I text a lot it would have been a great feature to have. So far though I haven't had a problem making or answering calls, I have my Bluetooth place on the visor and I try to be as clear as possible.
4	1365379200	I am skipping the detailed positive review since this unit works very well.So far I got two problem:- If you clip this thing to your car's visor, make sure you return your visor to it's original position before you exit the car.  Otherwise, it won't be able to detect you when you come in and doesn't turn itself on.- I connect my Galaxy Nexus to this as a second phone (my wife's iphone 4S being first).  All I got is bluetooth audio connection.  I can't make phone calls with it.  I can stream music to it, but not phone calls.  I don't know if this is a bug with my phone or this unit is incompatible with my phone.  However, my phone's Bluetooth pairs fine with my Pioneer head unit in my other car.
4	1365206400	This is a good unit for using in different vehicles, Not quite as good as built in units but more than adequate in most older cars, I would recommend this to a friend
4	1365120000	Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone (Black, Retail Packaging)This is a pretty good visor mounted Bluetooth hands fee cellphone speaker kit. It is easy to get going, charge it with the included car kit and get it paired to your cellphone. Everything went as expected, very easy to do. I've made may calls with it and sound quality is decent and my voice was heard and no one complained about too much noise. You can also direct music to it from your smartphone if you have no other way to use your car's speakers. There is the FM connection to the car radio but being in Los Angeles, I've never been able to make that work in other devices, this was no exception. In a smaller market that would be a great feature. Maybe I need to move.I did get to test the voice recognition with a friend who has an accent and it actually worked pretty well. That was a pleasant surprise. The overall performance and the Voice Assist feature work very well. I was concerned about mounting to the visor with the clip but it hasn't given me any trouble, so far.Over all this is a fine Bluetooth speaker phone for your car, it works well sounds pretty good and is full of nice
3	1365120000	I recently purchased a new car that did not come with standard blue tooth technology.  Since my old car came equipped with this feature, I felt lost without it.  After searching the internet (Amazon), I purchased the Jabra Freeway, the Jabra Journey, and the Motorolla Roadster 2, because after reading the reviews I wasn't sure which would work best for me. I have an iPhone 4S, and I wanted something with voice activation, a motion senor, and an FM tuner.  Out of all 3, I decided to keep the Jabra Journey and returned the other two.  This is why;  The Jabra Freeway was the most expensive and in my option the worst.  The only thing that I like about it was the clarity of the speakers.  It didn't recognize my voice, or my son's, the FM tuner worked, but barely.  It played over the radio but with way too much static and interference.  Had pretty much the same issues with the Motorolla Roadster, except that it did recognize my voice commands.  The clarity was weak in comparison to the Jabra Freeway, and the FM tuner was just as bad.  I decided to keep the Jabra Journey, even though it did not have the FM tuner, which is what I thought I wanted most of all.  I came to realize that I would have static and interference with most of the FM tuner devices, so I gave up on that idea.  The sound on the Jabra Journey was so clear and loud that I no longer think I care to have the FM tuner.  The Journey also has a motion senor so it turns off and on upon entering and exiting the vehicle.  The set up was easy, and it recognized all my voice commands.  The Journey was less than half the cost of the Freeway and a little less than the Roadster, and by far the best of the three.  So happy with my purchase that I am considering buying a second one for my son's car.
3	1365120000	Call quality and speaker tiny at timesThis is a very decent and average product. When compared to other Jabra's it rates out pretty well. Not sure there really s a great portable, in car speaker phone on the market. I use this with my iPhone 5 and call quality is hit or miss. I have as many good calls as I do bad. Quality being suspect on the other end, meaning the people I am talking to have issues understanding me. The FM feature is more miss than hit and sometimes just goes away completely. Over all I wouldnt recommend this product but also don't hate it at the same time.
5	1365033600	Bought a high end 2009 vehicle that had all the bells and whistles EXCEPT bluetooth. Option from dealer would have been $600+. Researched my options online for a product that did not have to be attached to my ear and found the awesome Jabra Freeway. Clips to your visor. Sound quality is awesome. Simple to use if you take the time to watch the video and follow the install instructions. My entire contact list is accessible through the Voice Assist programming. You can likewise program to send and receive calls through the speaker system on your vehicle if that is your preference. Cost.....unbelievable deal in the $70 range. My non-techie husband liked this product so much that he had one ordered for his work assigned vehicle that likewise lacked bluetooth.  You will not be disappointed if you want truly reliable handsfree driving communications at a reasonable cost.
5	1364947200	This is really the best product from JABRA. Don't go for anything cheap because it will stop working after a while and even though you will not find the options as this one.Before that I had the cruize bluetooth speakerphone, it was very bad. I really recommend it for anyone however it is cheap, but worth it.
2	1364947200	pros:-i still am guessing it's the best of its kind (speakerphones) in the market.  However, I think it's better to just buy a dashboard mount (i now use iOttie easyone touch car mount) and find some apps (ex CarHomeUltra, Tasker, Rotation Locker) to create a &#34;car mode&#34; for your phone (android)cons:-couldnt read incoming texts or scroll through old ones-inadvertent pressing of buttons when flipping up visor-voice recogntion was very very glitchy (THE deal breaker)-transmission to FM stereo station was plagued with a lot of static (headache!!!).  couldnt easily scan to a better option.-i had a very &#34;robotic&#34; sound to my voice to callers (as opposed to using speaker phone on my mounted android which sounded normal to all)
1	1364774400	I got this to use in my car hoping it would give me a hands free alternative to an earpiece.  It worked ok for a week but now no one can understand  me on my iPhone.  I also hoped the buttons would make it easy to control volume and place calls but it is way too easy to have it redial when that is the last thing I want to happen.  Incoming call notification is jarringly loud. It does play music from my phone. The fm feature is useless.  Save your money, this is pure junk.
3	1364515200	I spent the extra money for the voice features. Answering an incoming call works great. Any other vice command does not work, it always just &#34;redials&#34; I would say overall I am disappointed with this product.
1	1364256000	Voice activation of contacts is useless.  Reviews indicate this feature.  Upon customer service contact, they indicate additional application dowload is required for this feature.  Bad marketing.  Works ok once call is made which is not safe driving.  Stick with bluetooth earpiece better value. Now I know why new car systems are hi $.
5	1363824000	I hate those guys that wear bluetooth earpieces.  Hate them.  I drive a ton for my job and didn't want to be one of "those guys".  So I searched for alternatives.  And this Jabra Freeway Speakerphone is the ideal solution.It's basically just a speakerphone that you hook to your sunvisor.  It connects to your phone through the bluetooth and it's a handsfree solution to being able to talk on your phone in the car.  It sounds good on your end and I've been told that I sound perfectly clear when I talk to someone.This is a fantastic product.  Jabra always makes quality devices and this is no exception.  Its sturdy, clips tightly to your sunvisor, and the battery life is extremely good.Highly recommended if you also hate bluetooth earpieces.
5	1363737600	Once you figure out how it works, it's great!  I would recommend it to a friend without a doubt any day.
5	1363737600	Excellent sound from the 3 speakers. I have been told that it sounds like I am standing right next to them when I am talking on my Jabra Freeway. Great product.
5	1363737600	&Oacute;timo, pr&aacute;tico e com um som surpreendentemente de excelente qualidade. Estou usando o dispositivo para viva a voz e ouvir minhas m&uacute;sicas no carro. O produto vem muito bem embalado, com manual e v&aacute;rios idiomas (incluindo portugus), carregador veicular e certificado de garantia. Poderia vir tamb&eacute;m com adptador para carregar na rede de energia el&eacute;trica e no apenas dentro do carro.
5	1363651200	I absolutely love this speaker. For it's size, the sound is great. Very clear. I would definitely purchase it again.
5	1363046400	It was time for me to replace my old hands free, but I wanted good quality sound for me & for whom ever I would call & that's just what I got! It pairs easily, had it going in minutes.
4	1363046400	Update:Some voice commands are not recognized. For instance, when I say battery, the device keeps saying please say a command.I purchased this at a Verizon store. I never liked the Bluetooth headsets; they never seem to work correctly.  I recently purchased Jabra Freeway and so far it has impressed me. The speaker is loud which is a plus and when am I using the Google Navigation on my Droid Razr Maxx, I am able to hear the turn-by-turn directions clearly.I like how the device connects when I enter my car and disconnects when I leave. I am able to play and hear Pandora through this device.  The only issue is recognizing some of the voice commands; however, I think that has to do with the smartphone itself rather than this device.I'll make some revisions to my review as I use it more. I would certainly recommend this device to anyone whose car does not have Bluetooth capability.
1	1362960000	it would not connect to any radio station with out a lot of static! My radio worked great even had it looked at by a tech he said it was not my radio or antenna. So i tried it in another car same thing happened! For the 100 plus bucks you are paying for this it should work great. but it doesn't. I would try a different model or brand all together. Not a happy customer. but i do have to say AMAZON did a great job at giving me my money back no problem!
5	1362873600	Well it's the best speakerphone with a bluethooth i'v been using it for a year it's goodFor hands free talking not music
5	1362873600	Wonderful product. You never have to take your eyes off the road. So simple to set up and use. Playing your music threw this is awesome not only does it tell you who is calling but also turns down the music. I ordered it and Amazon delivered it immediately two days and I had it ... Amazon your the best!
4	1362787200	It works in the car and in the home with my tablet and my phone.  The speaker is awesome.  After a few months of using this speaker Ive noticed that it has a hard time paring with my phone sometimes and the fm feature is not that good.  I would buy another one.
5	1362787200	Siri integrates well.  Google Maps GPS instructions are great and the FM integration is OK, but I look at it as a nice bonus.  The built in speakers are awesome.  Highly recommended.
4	1362700800	All works very nice, but the fm transmiter isnt too powerful, if another car got the same channel you will hear music from the other car.
5	1362614400	BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT (BLUF) - Speakers are loud and clarity is 8 out of 10 (room for improvement, but not much considering the overall size of the device).  Speaker clarity seems great, as I haven't had any complaints and everyone says they can hear me just fine.  Battery life is excellent, and build quality even seems very good.If you want to buy just one and not have to worry if it's going to be good enough or not, try this.  I'm willing to be you won't be disappointed.The finer details and small print -I don't have a large basis for comparison, speaking in terms of bluetooth speakerphones, but I can tell you that I haven't had any issues with the Freeway speakerphone.  I've only used it intermittently, and I am still operating on the very first charge when I began using this device nearly a month ago.  Of course, I do turn mine off when I know I'll be out of the car for a while.  I've left it on overnight a few times, but still the battery persists.  I leave my bluetooth turned on in my phone, and when I turn on the Jabra in the car it connects within a few seconds after simply flipping the Jabra switch.  If you leave it on and roam about your house with your car parked in your garage, sure - it will probably stay connected.  I've had that issue a few times but it's a pretty simple workaround - turn one of the devices off (bluetooth on the phone or Jabra).  Assuming that the Jabra is left on and it does disconnect when you get out of the car, I've noticed it will automatically reconnect shortly after you get back in the car and generate some vibrations - shutting the door, starting, or backing up.People I talk to seem to have no problems hearing me, less problems in fact than when I use my Apple iPhone supplied wired headset.  The speaker is loud enough to where I have the volume at roughly 30-40% and rarely have to turn it up.  For voice dialing, I use the iPhone-supplied Siri through the speakerphone, and that handles all of my voice dialing/voice texting needs.As for the FM transmitter, I've used it a few times but...it's an FM transmitter.  The sound quality isn't very good and the amount of static heard on my end is significant.  Of course, this might be from my factory radio that has a very weak reception capability in the first place (2003 Audi A4).  I didn't really care for the FM transmission option because I knew the quality wouldn't be that good anyway.  It's FM.  It's never going to be a good quality sound, but at least it's there when you really want to hear that one song or there's absolutely no alternative.
2	1362182400	It was easy to connect to the phone and set up and has great clarity on the user end, but the person on the other end of the bluetooth sounds like the wind is blowing I was having to repeat most of my conversations, I  also contacted Jabra and sent them an email about the problem and they never responded.
1	1362096000	I bought this device for several reasons.  I wanted a bluetooth device that was easy to operate, positioned strategically, that I didn't have to put in my ear.  I've lost several of the in-the-ear bluetooth devices and they're expensive little buggers.  Too, my car isn't exactly new so the stereo doesn't have a bluetooth interface that would allow me to play music from my iPhone over the radio speakers.  This device boasts the ability to transmit music from your cell phone via FM radio frequencies to your in-car stereo while still being able to use the bluetooth for making phone calls.  The Jabra name sealed the deal as the perfect device for me.  Beyond use in my car, its portability and promised excellent audio from the device itself seemingly fulfilled another need I had...its use in my work vehicle.  Well, the audio was less than excellent.  The volume was insufficient to compete with wind noise while driving.  Even when sitting still, the microphone in the device performed poorly.  &#34;Siri&#34;, iPhone's voice recognition interface, couldn't understand what I was saying at all.  People I tried to talk to over the phone couldn't understand half of what I said and told me that I sounded far away in a tin can.  Unlike another Jabra model, this device doesn't have a button for interfacing directly with smartphone voice commands, requiring you instead to hold down the &#34;talk&#34; button for 2-3 seconds to accomplish what should be an intuitive momentary push.  The device had line-of-sight with the car's radio antenna which was all of maybe 4 feet away and the FM signal from the device wasn't strong enough to hold the signal on the car's radio making it totally useless for playing music on the car's radio.  Jabra had some very good ideas that were very poorly executed and the result is a $100 paperweight.  I just looked at their website and see that they've come out with some newer models.  Frankly, after this experience, I would have a very hard time talking myself into buying another of their products without being able to first try it out in a store.
5	1362096000	This was easy to set up and works perfectly in the car.  I have found bluetooth devices less than optimal in a moving vehicle but this speaker is a very good fit for me.
5	1361836800	Works great.  Sounds better than a new car pre installed one. Plan on getting another one for a family memebers
5	1361836800	Had a Blackberry bluetooth speakerphone a few years back that wasn't user friendly... actually a hassle. The Jabra turns on when I get in and is ready to go.
1	1361836800	I needed an option to connect my phone to my car stereo.  I have an older car without an aux in plug nor does my car stereo have a bluetooth feature.I purchased this to compare it to the Motorola Roadster 2 bluetooth and FM features.  My review will be related to the FM feature as that is what I purchased the product for.Review:I really wanted to like this product.  It is substantially larger than the Motorola Roadster 2 but seemed like it would be louder (using the built in speakers) as they were much bigger.  I was very impressed with the look of this compared to the Motorola Roadster 2.  When used without the FM feature this was louder than the Motorola Roadster 2 although I still could not hear everything that was being said all the time and with the windows open you can forget about using it at all (as I get older I do notice I have some hearing loss).FM Transmitter: My location Rocklin/Roseville CAThis feature was abysmal.  In both of my cars (2001 Acura TL and 2005 GMC Yukon XL) the FM transmitter could barely transmit to an empty station.  In my Acura there was quite a bit of static.  When I played music through my phone I could barely hear it.  In my GMC the music couldn't even cut through the static to be heard.  I tried to move the Jabra to different locations closer to my car stereo and it still wouldn't transmit the signal clearly.For me this was a deal breaker.  I sent the product back and stuck with the Motorola Roadster 2.Pros:-Nice design-Multiple speakers that sound much better than other products-Could realistically be used as a portable speakerCons:-FM Transmitter weaker (MUCH MUCH) than other competing products-Much larger than other products like the Motorola Roadster 2
4	1361750400	I use it at home as well as auto.  I don't have to run across the house to pickup a ringing cellphone sitting on a charge station.
5	1361750400	Works great with all iPhones. I look at people holding their phones in their cars and I think... Why??? Love this thing.
5	1361664000	Amazon purchased through affiliate and it was delivered on time, in excellent condition. Charged it up, synced to iPhone 5 easily and has been working ever since on the sun visor of my classic car. Very slim and attractive footprint so to speak. Second hand price was much much better than new......and it works ....!!!
1	1361664000	I had high hopes for this device, but it let me down.  The auto pair On and OFF doesn't work consistently.  The voice assist feature does not appear to auto connect with Cell Com users.  I worked patiently with Voice assist customer service but they did not come through and just stopped returning my phone calls.One nice feature of this device was the clarity of the sound.
4	1361318400	1. This was delivered in the timeframe indicated if not before......5 stars for that.2.  Battery life is amazing, and it turns off when you are not in the car automatically....5 stars for that.3.  I love the fact that you can continue your conversation when you are ready to get out of the car without having to hang up and call back to use your phone instead of the speaker phone......5 stars for that.4.  Occasionally has glitches in connecting to my iPhone for some reason when I want to make a call....3 stars for that.5.  Once I get home, get out of the car and not on a call, if I use my phone in the kitchen(right beside the garage)  My phone sometimes transfers the call to the speakerphone in my car.  Although easy to fix, it's just irritating.....3 stars for that.Overall it is a good speakerphone.  I have played music over the speakerphone and the sound quality is good for the small size and without base speakers. It is made for the speaking voice so audiobooks sound great over the speaker phone and I don't have to pause the audiobook to take the call - it transfers to the phone when a call comes in.I would definitley recommend it over others I have tried, in addition to the ear piece models.
5	1361059200	Call voice clear, the use is convenient. Temporarily haven't find faults! The use of experience: have one answer the phone habits while driving, the new traffic law came out, a friend bought this, really very convenient.
2	1360972800	(iphone 5) I purchased two of these as xmax presents to use with iphone 5's. Both of them have linking and sound quality problems. Also the fm modulator is pretty much worthless.
5	1360972800	I purchased my Jabra Freeway for my NEW car when they started talking about hands free calling in city government, talking about how much safer it was than holding the phone and trying to talk or dial.  I got mine out of the box put it in my Suburban and that is where it has stayed!!!  We love it.  If we have the entire family along everyone can talk on the phone to the person who is calling, which makes it FUN!  I have the BIG Box "Phone" in my truck, however, who needs it as long as I have my Jabra Freeway!!!  It works like a champ.  I do get emails and texts over my Jabra, however, have not been brave enough to have it read them yet.  For regular everyday calls it is the GREATEST plus I did download Pandora to my phone so now I can listen to MY kind of music anytime and it plays right over my Jabra.  Of course it is pre-empted for phone calls.  Another nice feature.  But I still use it more than "On Star"!!!!!Thanks again.....looking now to upgrade my DH's Suburban and put something like the Jabra in his vehicle.  Probably not as ellaborate since he will ONLY use it for phone calls.  And probably only in about a 20 mile radius of home.
1	1360886400	To give some perspective, I was planning to use this in Central NY which has spotty connection when it comes to radio stations. I should've heeded everyone's warnings about not counting on the FM transmitter but I really wanted to believe that it could work for me.Following the initial full charge, I paired the Jabra Freeway with my Motorola Droid Razr and it connected instantly. Every time I turn the speakerphone on and off, it connects without any issues. This is where the Pros for this product ends.In the quiet of my bedroom, I tested the voice commands out and started to get confused about my options. Luckily, you can ask the "Genie" what commands there are are and she will list them out. Unfortunately, I just found that the commands weren't intuitive and I would've had to be reminded often. The "Genie" actually understanding my commands was a hit or miss and one time, "Next track" made her redial. I was already starting to feel unsure about the product but wanted to test it in my car.In my car is where it became disastrous and I found myself wanting to chuck the product out my window. I tested the FM transmitter and was immediately worried when all I heard was static. It connected for a second and then when I started driving, it lost the connection and pressing the "FM" button just made the "Genie" announce the same radio station that disconnected 2 seconds prior. This could be because of my location so I tried not to fault the Freeway for this.Next, I tested out the music and realized that the sound coming out of this little device barely filled the interior of my Nissan Rogue. I was annoyed as the highest volume only made the music more distorted. I thought to myself, "Okay, I will just listen to music through the AUX input", disappointed because I bought the Freeway to eliminate some wires.Finally, I wanted to make a phone call. This was the Achilles heel for the Freeway. First of all, if you have music playing through the Freeway, it will be impossible for the "Genie" to understand anything you're saying. How pointless because if the product is "hands-free", I shouldn't have to reach around to lower/turn off my music in order to give a command. I said "Phone commands" and then to "Call ______" which ended up calling the wrong person multiple times. I don't know if it's because the Freeway thinks all of my friends have similar sounding names but it was only able to call the right person after 20 minutes of me shouting in the complete silence of my car. I was thoroughly frustrated at this point because it couldn't handle it's main purpose of making a hands-free phone call. The only way I could be successful in one attempt was to recite the actual phone number and even then, sometimes it's wrong. Also, when I was on the call, at the highest volume I couldn't hear parts of the conversation and my friends couldn't hear me clearly as well.I really wanted to believe that this product could be exactly what I was hoping for but it ended up being an expensive paperweight. I tested it out for 4 more days just in case it was just something I had to get used to but thinking about what a hassle it was, I found myself going back to my in-ear Bluetooth because even if I couldn't command it to make phone calls, I was at least able to answer a call without having to shut off my music. Unfortunately, this device will be going back and I will have to hunt some more for a safe way to make hands-free phone calls while going through my car's stereo.
5	1360800000	a repute brand, a good item with good price. and everything is good.hope it can help you to choose a good speakerphone to you.
5	1360627200	I've tried motorola, jawbone, plantronics and other jabras. This is the only one that i've been satisfied with. I'm very picky on my electronics and expect a lot from them. When I  first got this, I made numerous calls just to test it out and asked how I sounded on it. Most of the time, the person on the other side didn't notice that I was on a bluetooth. I've noticed that sometimes when the other person is also on a handsfree device (one person in particular) the quality was terrible. Not sure why that would have any effect. Might just be that persons device. The sound quality from the 3 speaker system is superb. The battery last practically forever. I only charge it once a month or more.
4	1360540800	I travel a lot and this is functional to allow hands free communication.  There are times when there is a little static...but not enough to disrupt phone conversation.
5	1360454400	This is a Godsend for me. It quickly pairs with my iPhone via Bluetooth so that I can: use the phone hands free-listen to podcasts or music; and most importantly, to turn by turn directions from Google maps. The speakers are loud and adjustable;the unit recharges via a dc mini USB from the car-I do this at night when the truck is parked.When the Jabra is powered on, a voice says &#34;powered on&#34;. When it is paired, it announces &#34;connected&#34;. This is more useful than you think.My aftermarket car radio is bluetooth also, but does not work as well and getting it to play music takes several steps that get tiresome; and the gps not at all. This is a much better solution.
5	1360454400	Love it!!!Very happy with it. Bought it for my husband. He travels quite a bit. Prefer to  have this rather than something in your ear obstructing your hearing
4	1360281600	I really like this product.  The sound is loud and clear.  Since it's bluetooth, I also use it at home, when I know I won't be using it in the car for a few days (like during a snow storm) - makes everything it can connect to sound better.  I really dig it.
4	1360195200	This Jabra Freeway gives me not only hands free without an ear piece, but almost clear communication to the people on the other side.  This has always been the problem, all others to noisey in the car.  Most tell me it is like talking on a regular phone!  I hear the people perfectly on my end.  The device connects as soon as I get in my car and ready to go.  I recommend this item!
2	1359590400	I'm not happy with this product. I purchased it 2 years ago and I pretty much stopped using it now.THE GOOD:- The sync process was smooth and immediate- Great battery life- Voice recognition is good.- It uses the micro-USB as a charger instead of a separate power adapter.- The latch the holds the device is solid.THE BAD:- The "firmware" update that is downloadable from the manufacturer's website is incompatible with my MacBook Air. It requires a Windows computer. So any improvements/bug fixes that may come along will not work for me.- Volume is weak. I do plenty of freeway driving on my Ford Explorer Limited all over Los Angeles and I find the volume insufficient. Mind you, I have good hearing and my SUV is mid-scale. I rarely open my windows.- Certain frequencies, the speakers start to distort/crack when volume is maximum- My friends could barely hear me talk and alot of background noise as I've been told, repeatedly.- The multi-function main button (to end the call) is sensitive. Sometimes it senses I pressed twice and it calls back the caller.- It has happened a few times already but the Bluetooth connection with my iPhone 4 gets disconnected. There's no obstructions in-between and it's only 3 feet away.- I tried to stream music / podcasts but the sound quality is not good and not loud enough specially when listening to monotone-voiced NPR journalists!- Overall, the device is somewhat buggy. To fix this I had to resort to the classic fix: turn-off & turn-on!
5	1359504000	I have only had this item for  few days and ordered it with the thought that I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype.  It was easy to set up and everyone that I have called using it says that my voice is clear even over the car noise.  i hear the person on the other end well also.I purchased this so also use as a speakerphone when I am on conference calls.  I only have a cell phone for business calls and I don't always want to be holding th cell phone duing lengthy calls and when I use Bluetooth ear piece the people on the other end often say that they cannot hear me clearly.  This works well for the application.I haven't tried it with my iPod (with Bluetooth adapter which I purchased from Amazon) yet, but plan on trying that out also.  I did sign on to the free year of Voice Assist and it works well.  I'll have to decide if the $59.00 per year fee is worth it after the trial year.My husband calls me a geek for always being one to try a new electronic gadget, but that is how you find nice items like this!
5	1359331200	No one reviewed this product with the information that i needed to purchase. I bought it anyway but...My question was if I had my phone plugged in listening to music through a monster cable to the iphone 5 will the bluetooth still operate on the visor unit?-The answer is Yes- When you plug in your plug your phone in it will ask you if you want to stream the music through the bluetooth or headphone- select headphone and if someone calls it will mute the music to grab the call- The voice function is pretty easy specially of you have Siri- Well built device- i've had it over a month without needing to charge it-use it everydayHighly Recommended!
3	1359331200	not the worst. it does work but not worth it. The call quality is average. not horrible but not very good either.
5	1358467200	All I wanted a bluetooth speaker that just works.  This was my third attempt.  Other products let far too much noise through:  person on the other end couldn't hear a thing.  Short:  crystal clear even at highway speeds.  Love the automatic pairing which happens when it senses movement.  14 hour talktime is fine, means charging once a month.  Delighted to have found this.  Does just what it says.
1	1358467200	This product is described that it cancels noise in the background. It does not. No one could hear me, not even when my car was parked and not moving!
5	1358208000	I received the Jabra freeway very fast and after changing I found the unit betty easy to set up and works very well. I have also used the Jabra freeway in a hotel room while we were away to play my music. Very happy with this purchase
1	1358208000	I'd like to believe Jabra's quality control is bad.  This product was noisy, it sounded 200% over-modulated and tinny-loud (even at the lowest iPhone volume), the FM transmitter was terrible on any station and I ended up resorting to iPhone speaker phone to improve the quality of my conversations.  I used this for about 2 hours (partially listening to people say 'What?' many times).  I used it in my BMW and in my quiet house - it sucked!I'm returning it and going for the Motorola.  They always have decent quality products.Sorry Jabra - but this product was terrible!
5	1358208000	My previous speakerphone was not loud enough.  I had to hold it up to my ear!  The Freeway has great output on its own, and when put through the auto sound system with the quick touch of one button, it lacks any downfall of volumn, even if I were in a hurricane!  It works great, and I highly recommend it.
5	1358121600	Excellent, the noise suppression is very good. the volumes are loud and clearI bought two, one for the car and the other for my bedroom
5	1358035200	My employer has provided this hands-free phone system for all of our field team.  When I first saw it, I thought what a great gift for my boyfriend.  We love it.  We get great reception and I know he is safe while driving!
2	1357948800	I travel a great deal and was very excited about using my Jabra FREEWAY. The initial set-up was a breeze. The unit is very user-friendly. I could hear very well on my end. However, the sound quality was poor for the listener. I had so many complaints that I had to resort back to my earbuds and shut the unit off completely. I returned the item.
3	1357862400	This product has very good features, but they do not always work. About 1/3 of the time the device will not connect to my phone unless I turn of the device and turn it back on. Bummer, since connecting to the phone is its primary purpose. If I entered the car several times a day and had to do this 1/3 of the time I would rate the product unsatisfactory. Good battery life as it turns itself off once your phone leaves the car, and automatically turns itself on when you re-enter. Audio clarity leaves room for improvement.
5	1357776000	this is a great speakerphone to have in the car.  works well and would say it is worth the money.
4	1357776000	I received this product on Dec 17, charged it up, and put it in my car on the 18th.  It was trivial to sync my phone (iPhone 5) and to start using it.  I get in my car, and within a few seconds the Jabra announces it is connected to my phone, which I just keep in my pocket.  It switches well if I am in the middle of a conversation and get in the car, or start the conversation on the Jabra and get out of the car.  It works very well for me as a hands free phone device.  The volume is excellent, and I do not have to run it anywhere near full volume.  The voice commands work great, ONCE you figure out how to pronounce the words.  I tried many times to find out the battery level - the talk time remaining.  BAttery.  baTTery,  batterY.  If you don't give a command the Jabra understands, it lists them. I listened carefully and discovered that I didn't know how to spell &#34;battery.&#34;  They pronounce it baDDery.  OK.  Works.  And as a side note, I charged it once, took it with us and put it in our rental car (10 days) and put it back in my car when we came home.  It's now Jan 10 and I still have 8 hours of talk time left (it started with 14 hours).I am very happy with the device except for one thing - it garbles Bluetooth audio.  I use my iPhone as a GPS unit (putting it on a dashboard mount http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007FHX9OK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_12) and have the voice assist enabled.  When I use the iPhone without the Jabra, the voice commands are clear.  When I let the voice commands come through the Jabra, it often leaves out part of the direction given by the phone.  It loves to leave out &#34;quarter&#34; as in &#34;turn left in a quarter mile&#34; and several other words, like &#34;left&#34;.  It is sort of frustrating, especially when you are wondering what to do next.  I don't know if there is any way to correct this problem.  It seems intrinsic to the device.But I do like the Jabra FREEWAY and would purchase it again.  It would be nice if they could fix the garbled audio.
4	1357689600	This was simple to start using. Just charge it and put it in the car. However, I still have trouble getting it to recognize which person I want to talk with, and it gets worse as I get further from home. I don't know why it can't understand my voice better, but I have literally made 8 tries before getting it to understand that I want it to call spouse.
3	1357257600	The sound quality is OK, you can't turn up the volume very high with out getting a static sound.  Since I do not have wifi in my car, I am happy to have this product but don't expect too much from it for listening to music at a moderate volume.
1	1357257600	I have never had as bad of an experience with a product as I have with the Freeway. It does not work as described, and I felt a review was necessitated to save others from making the same mistake.It took calls okay, and the call quality was decent, but that's it. The "phone commands" just does not work with my iPhone 4S. 89% of the time saying "phone commands" will do nothing; the Freeway just times out listening for your voice input. 5% of the time saying "phone commands" will start playing music on the iPhone. The final 1% works correctly after you restart the unit, and it activates Siri. However, it will only activate Siri the first time you try after restarting the Freeway. All subsequent attempts will end with the same results I have listed above. When trying to tell the Freeway to "Stop" playing the music it redials the last person I called. Not being able to have it work with Siri to place calls is an absolute deal breaker.I can't speak for every phone out there, but if you have an iPhone 4S stay away from this piece of junk! You've been warned.
1	1357171200	The Jabra freeway claims to disconnect when you leave your car. It only does so when you move over 50 feet away. If you vehicle is closer than that, like when it is in your garage or at the top of your driveway, it will stay connected to your phone. This causes lost incoming calls and prevents outgoing calls unless you get back into your car.It is beyond my comprehension how a company can market a communications device that prevents communications. I don't know if this is the result of defective design, defective manufacturing process, bad quality control, defective testing or all of the above.I have returned it to Amazon and will seek out similar products that work. If anyone knows which ones work let us in on it please.
4	1357171200	I like the Jabra Freeway speakerphone.  It is very clear and easy to use.Dislike fact that you have to purchase the extra features although you get the first year free.
3	1357084800	I really like this speaker. The sound is really great.  When talking to someone, they tell me I don't sound like I'm on speaker phone. There are some problems with the Voice Command Lady.  We fight a lot. I ask her to play music.  She tells me that she is redialing last number.  I ask her to Answer call, she tells me my battery life.  Lucky, Siri can be use instead of the Jabra system and things usually get done a lot better.
5	1356998400	I purchased the freeway  for Christmas and have been using it since. Very good battery life. Connects automatically and quickly. Im told quality is good by people I have been talking to. So far I would buy again. If I am still happy I will be buying another one for my son in the spring when he gets his license. I will leave another review then.
4	1356825600	I was worried the sound quality would be bad--I hate when people put me on speakerphone, and was worried that's what this would be like for people I was talking to. Everyone tells me it's fine. No complaints.The FM transmitter doesn't really work--I live in the city and there just isn't any station that's free enough of interference for it to get a good signal. But I don't miss it, it works totally fine without.I've had it for months and only charged it a couple of times.This is the only device of it's kind I've ever had, so I can't compare it to anything. But I would buy this one again.
5	1356652800	I absolutely love Jabra! Jabra makes driving a 5 speed manual much safer in Greenville, SC. I feel helpless when I let Jabra's battery run down!
4	1356652800	... but not perfect. The voice recognition seems to only work about 80% of the time but all in all this is the best bluetooth in this price range.
5	1356566400	I got the Freeway along with my iPhone 4S. It connected easily, and reconnects every time I get into my car. I sit down, and by the time I turn the ignition, it's reconnected (and lets you know by saying so). It works great as a speakerphone, callers sound good and I sound good to them. The volume goes up pretty high so you can still hear fine if you have a loud car. If..
5	1356566400	Easy to use!  Sound quality is amazing!  No problems at all with this product.  You do not need to buy the voice assist if you have an app on your phone!
5	1356480000	I just bought a new car and the only way Bluetooth was included was to go for the next model up from what I purchased.  I wasn't going to spend $2,000 bucks just to get bluetooth so I started doing a little research.  I picked the Freeway because it had the best features for the cost.  I was also impressed with the other reviews that talked about the quality of the sound of the unit.I installed it and have now used it for a couple of days and I'm impressed with the results.  I have it connected to an iPhone 4 and it works well.  I've tested almost all the functions and they all work as advertized.  I have a OLDER motorolla unit in my previous car and the sound on this one is MUCH better and the folks that I have called say the sound quality is fine.I have NOT used the Voice Active for Emails or Texts.  One because I firmly believe if you want information quickly then freakin call me.  Second I get so much spam in email that the thought of having it constantly going off just didn't sound appealing to me.  I only have this synced to my private phone so I really don't need to have email and text.I've use the FM for linking to the radio in the car and checked it with using my iPhone GPS (Active X) and makeing phone calls and it works great.  Using the phone to play playlists/podcasts also works well although if you are in a city with a number of FM stations finding a workable frequency may be a problem.Overall I could not have expected more from the unit.
5	1356393600	This was very easy to set up and work with Siri. It works just like it should, and easy to do while driving without being distracted. I ended up buying one for a friend that has a bad habit of texting and or talking while driving, and thought would be the safest way for her to do that, and it worked. Very easy for her to use, and that was the most important thing, otherwise it would have been a waste of money. She uses it faithfully and loves the simplicity of it... well worth the $$ and I wouldn't hesitate to buy one again
2	1356393600	While the features of this device are cool, the FM transmitter is its Achilles heel. I purchased this Bluetooth to replace an even cheaper Bluetooth with FM transmitter, which in fact, has a way better transmitter than the Jabra. While the Jabra finds "the best available signal", this does not cut it. I live in a large city, I have a modern car, which even meets the RDS and other things the menu suggests for the Bluetooth speaker/transmitter to work properly, but I could still hear noise, at times. This never happened and still doesn't happen with my old and cheaper Bluetooth FM transmitter.Another problem was that one can not adjust the already factory-set volume, so the music comes out of the car's speakers with a lot of bass, which distorts the sound -to an extent. I contacted Jabra and I was told there was nothing I could do about those settings as they came that way from the factory.Luckily for me, the seller was very kind and gave me a refund.If you are looking at this product because of it's FM transmitter I would advise you to look elsewhere. However, if you want it because of its built-in speakers, then by all means, this is the product for you.
2	1356220800	Works okay for outgoing calls (limited to how good your phone's capabilities are) but every incoming call gets disconnected. Jabra's support line answer - not our problem - call your phone provider.
5	1356048000	Heard about this from the Joe Rogan podcast (Redban).Most car Bluetooth add-on accessories I've seen are cheesy pieces of garbage. I'm a product snob, I don't do cheesy, and this thing rocks for use in cars with no or poorly implemented phone interfaces.PROS-reliable BT connection, for those that say it isn't, they have interferernce or phone issues-straight forward and reliable user interface (both the buttons and the voice command)-great battery life-good speakers for the size (I don't know what other reviewers were expecting from something this size)-the design is sleek, simple, and it feels well built-can be put on the visor, thus out of the wayCONS-In metropolitan areas the FM transmitter doesn't work due to interference, this is not the product's fault though, even when an FM channel sounds empty, they are not in metropolitin areas. Go to the central valley or some other sparsely populated place and it works well
4	1355529600	I agree with most of the review comments I've seen recently, so I won't repeat them.  Generally, the unit works well, has good sound, decent volume (but never enough to overcome some noisy situations), and much improved control ergonomics.  I haven't taken advantage of the Voice Assist feature (1 year free included) because the setup for that feature wouldn't directly import my contact list (from Windows Mail).  Tech support offered to format the CSV file I created, and I sent it to them, but so far no response!The Freeway is not an inexpensive unit, and Jabra makes another unit, the Tour, which is nearly as good.  I picked up one of those for my other car.  Besides the Voice Assist feature on the Freeway, you also have an FM feature on the Freeway which will supposedly employ your car audio system.  However, this feature is nearly useless, in my view, as the FM transmitter just doesn't have enough output to be clearly audible over my car stereo system.  I have other FM transmitter devices which work much better.  So, if this is a valued feature on your list, I'd say go for another device with that feature, or drop down to a lesser Jabra, like the Tour, and go without that feature.  You will save quite a bit in the process.
5	1355443200	My mother works in real estate and naturally uses her phone a lot, even when she's driving. Even though she talks on speakerphone mode, I had been worried about her losing attention to the road while looking for her phone and pressing the speaker button.This has all the features you need. And requires very little action by the user, so you don't have to sit with your mom going over the manual over and over only for her to forget how it works.Almost everything that requires user action is alerted by a voice from this machine, from battery low, to an incoming call, to paring it to a device.The thing also automatically turns on and off when the driver leaves and enters the vehicle and a voice lets you know when that happens too. It's also charged with an included micro-usb cable and car adapter, so she can charge her android phone while in her car. All those calls really eat up the battery!My favorite part? You take a call by saying "answer". No more rummaging through her purse to take a call for my mom!It also has very good speakers and microphone, so that the technologically illiterate can use it without having to remember the button to re-set the frequency on the radio should the reception get bad, although you can still go about it that way to utilize the car speakers.My mother is allergic to technology, but LOVES this speakerphone. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone looking for an in-car speakerphone system.Edit : After about a month, I've completely forgotten I'd given this to mother, because the microphone on it works so well. The price has gone up about $35 since I've bought it too, which, while I don't like, just shows how popular it's gotten.
5	1355270400	A Bluetooth Speakerphone that works as advertised!  I have had several that claim to do what this one does and had sell them cheap after being dissapointed.  You will LOVE this one!
4	1355184000	I love this speakerphone.  Almost no hands needed to use it.  Only downside is sometimes I forget to turn it off and I cant get calls inside my  house because it rings to the unit.  But, other than that, its a good way of talking while driving.
5	1355011200	This is awesome!  Works flawlessly with my Samsung Galaxy III.  and the receiving callers say its clearer than the phone!
5	1354838400	I bought two of these. Works great for me, but my wife did not like hers. Gave that unit to my son-in-law and he likes it. Battery charge lasts forever. Works well with my iPhone. Also a good desktop speaker.
1	1354752000	I purchased this to work with my iPhone and all I can say is that every call is "what?" "can you repeat that?"  "where are you? sounds like you are in a wind tunnel".  Every call is like my first cell phone conversation in the 90's.  Terrible.  I previously had a speaker for my Blackberry and it was great so I was expecting this to be even better.  So unhappy with this product but I only use it occasionally and kept attributing the bad reception to Verizon but seriously it can't be bad everywhere.  So by the time I came to the conclusion it was the stupid speaker and was thoroughly disgusted with it - I was outside the return window.  Thanks Amazon.  Another happy customer.  Now I resort to using the headphones that came with my iPhone to have a phone conversation when I'm on the road.  I don't like all the wires that go along with that so will have to invest more money and will now go with a headset of some sort.  All I can say is look elsewhere if you expect to actually be heard and understood during a conversation.
4	1354665600	It's great as a speakerphone. I've never had anyone tell me that they couldn't understand me. I love that I can take it from vehicle to vehicle with me. The FM transmitter is OK, but the audio quality is definitely not as good as plugging into my aux input. It would be nice if this had the option of a 1/8&#34; audio out (though I suppose you wouldn't want a wire hanging from your visor). In any case, great call quality, and voice commands work well.
1	1354320000	This is just another electronic item that does not work right.  First, it never would stay "paired" to my cell phone.  Every time I got in the car, I had to go through an agonizing process of trying to get my phone to pair with it.  My phone always indicated it was paired, but the device never would acknowledge it.  Plus, it never understood my voice commands and I had to always repeat them.  Very frustrating.  I returned the product after 1 week.
3	1354320000	I'm not to thrill about the  jabra freeway. It wasn't what I thought it would be. I bought it to install in my Expedition . But I guess if this is the first bluetooth that you've ever had for you vehicle then you might like it.  And I'm used to talking through the bluetooth  radio in my Terrain. Thats the reason I bought this, because I really really love the bluetooth in my Terrain. And from time to time, I have to have a reality check and realize that the sound isn't coming through the  radio speakers.  But as far as performance the only negative problems that I have to report is that it constantly disconnects  and I have to reconnect it.  As far as the other features on it,  I haven't used them enough to report any comments on them.  I did play my music through my HTC Viivid Cell , but only for a minute, because the sound coming through my radio speakers sounds a whole lot better.  I wish that I had bought a bluetooth cd player, but I had just upgraded about two years and didn't want to buy another cd. But far now I will just keep the jabra, but eventually I think that I will buy a bluetooth cd player because the performance is so much better.
4	1354233600	I like the jabra overall,but the noise canceling not so good.and sometimes it doesn't understand what I'm saying.I give it thumps up
3	1354147200	This is a good purchase if you want to talk to people without something hanging out of your ear.  If you want a true hands-free solution, keep shopping.The speaker quality is pretty good for a portable unit.  I found that the FM passthrough is iffy at best.  When driving at freeway speeds in my somewhat noisy car, I have people ask me if I have the top down - it picks up that much noise.  When I switch to my Jabra in-ear, people can hear me better.  So the noise cancellation is mediocre at best.  Battery life is amazing, and the feature set is pretty good.  Pairing and connection are first-rate, real easy.  It took some getting used to hearing a voice say "Connected" every time I sat down in my car!What drops this down to 3 stars is the voice command function - or should I say lack of function?  A typical afternoon with the Freeway goes something like this:  Me: "Call Elizabeth (sister's name)"  Jabra: "Playing Ted Nugent's Greatest Hits".  Cancel.  Me:  "Call Elizabeth"  Jabra:  "Redialing"  (someone else)  Cancel.  Me:  "Call Elizabeth"  Jabra:  "Voice Assist"  Cancel.  Me:  Make call using iPhone.  Or, Me:  "Battery"  Jabra: "Please say that again"  Me:  "Battery (different inflection)"  Jabra: "Please say that again"  Me:  "Battery (louder)"  Jabra: "Please say that again"  Me:  "Battery (louder, different inflection)"  Jabra: "Please say that again"  Me:  "Battery (with British accent)"  Jabra: "Please say that again"  Me:  "Baddery"  Jabra: "Please say that again"  Me:  "Battery (shouting)"  Jabra: "You can say Redial, Voice Assist, Phone Commands, Battery, or Cancel"  Me:  "Battery"  Jabra: "Please say that again"  AARRGGHH!!!!It's enough to drive you to drink.  But I'm driving, so I can't.  Maybe I should have just given two stars...
2	1353888000	Everything was awesome when I got this (it was a used version _ it came in the box already on, and you can't turn it off). I didn't think anything of it at the time, but it the was being battery up. For a few months, all was fine. But now the batteries won't recharge -- I gather that's a problem with this speakerphone, and now I have an expensive hunk of plastic and wires. Not cool. Not cool at all. I checked and there's no warning about the battery flaw, or at least how to prevent it from going bad.
2	1353456000	This product is not trustworthy.  It sometimes will not allow you to answer a call, sometimes it will now call the number you say.  I wish I had the $100 bucks back I paid for it.
5	1353456000	With all the things we have to do while driving, it is nice to have a tool to allow me to make and receive calls while on the road. I found this tool a while back and thought this would allow hands free driving. Washington State requires a hands free interface when on the phone, the law of the land is no hand held phones while driving. This was the answer and it has proven to be just that the answer.  I have an older Pickup with out a Blue Tooth interface, the Jabra FREEWAY has become my go to tool for all things related to my phone. I use it for my Navigation based needs as well. I liked it so much that I just bought a second unit for my NEW older Isuzu Trooper, so that my Wife and Best Friend can be safe, hands free and in touch while on the road.Dave
5	1353369600	Pretty easy to use, high quality audio and elegant look. My commute is 45 minutes and this just made my life easier. When you get a call, the device lets you know who is calling and responds to your voice command to answer or ignore. Also can text to anyone on your list. Love it!
1	1353369600	The FM transmitter is very weak. The speaker function is nice and very clear. However the difference between that and bluetooth speaker is the FM transmitter which is ~40 dollars more. This thing is worthless when it comes to the FM transmitter. The worse kind I have ever owned.
4	1353283200	Overall, pretty happy with the performance of the speaker. Excellent battery performance and it's easy to use. Really like the auto connect and auto shut down function.Did encounter some very minor issue during some of the calls, where the other party couldn't hear clearly on the conversation. I guess it's most likely due to positioning of the device.
5	1353283200	As someone with a car old enough to not have any sort of Bluetooth connection, this product made a lot of sense.  I was having trouble getting the radio transmitter to function well, but I moved it to the side of my sunshade and it can hit the FM receiver pretty well from there.  You also have to play around with the stations and find one where the existing signal is the weakest.  That part took me a while since I&#34;m in a very densely populated area with lots of radio stations.
5	1352851200	Bought this for my wife a couple of months ago.  She loves it!  Very easy to set up, works great.
3	1352851200	I researched the heck out of this before I decided on the Jabra Freeway.  It has everything I wanted and I was excited when it arrived the day after I ordered it on Amazon. Out of the box, it has the sleek look and solid feel of high quality audio gear.  I charged it up and turned it on.  Linking with my iPhone 5 was a snap, although sometimes it takes it a few minutes to connect to the phone when I turn bluetooth off and on on my phone - not sure what that's about.  The audio quality is very good, except for one very annoying problem.  The computer voice on the unit is loud - I mean startling, spill-your-coffee-in-your-lap loud.  Turn it down?  Unbelievably, you can't!  The volume control on the unit doesn't affect the computer voice.  You can turn the voice off, but then you lose the ability to use Freeway's and your phone's voice commands.  I also noticed that Freeway's voice recognition is so-so.  For examlple, you need to say "phone commands" to get through to iPhone's Siri, but despite using my clearest annunciation, the Freeway doesn't understand me about half the time and I need to repeat the command.I truly want to love Freeway and give it 5 stars, but instead, I'm returning it...
4	1352678400	This is a great product and does pretty much exactly what it says. Calls are fairly clear on both ends, even with the considerable road noise that I get from driving a convertible with the top up. Podcasts streamed via bluetooth are also loud and clear. I've seen some reviews that talk about playing music, which in my opinion is a little crazy. The speakers aren't THAT good. The FM transmitter works as well as any other I've used, but that isn't really saying much; FM transmitters can be hit or miss depending on the day. I find that I just stick with the built-in speaker, which is fine for phone calls and podcasts. That's exactly what I wanted this for, and it works like a charm. Very satisfied.
5	1352678400	Have been using this for two weeks and pretty impressed with the performance. The call quality is pretty good and sound seems to be pretty loud and clear.
1	1352246400	I was very disappointed in the unit it would not recognize the commands that I gave it when I asked to call from the contact list it automatically went to the music profile
5	1352073600	I don't usually write reviews, but I really like the Jabra Freeway! It is easy to install and pair with your phone, instructions are easy to follow. The battery charge lasts a long time, and tells you when it is low.Voice is clear. The device connects/disconnects automatically when you enter or leave your car, and it tells you it is connected/disconnected.I like the Freeway so much, I ordered 2 more for Christmas Gifts. I think everyone should have one!
1	1351641600	stereo sound is good; but the volume is too low. The worse is about 2 days later all of the sudden it won't receive any commands.  When I say phone command; it played music. I can't make calls, ect.... It was very frustrated and dangerous when it's not function while I'm driving. when I am making the call with this device; my friend can only hear my partial conversation. I end up returned it.
1	1351555200	I charged the device, paired it with my phone, activated my voice subscription and added contacts to my account.  After that it was a completed disaster.  Nothing worked.  About half the time the device would not respond to voice commands at all.  When it did respond it was always wrong.  "Redial" is supposed to call the last number that dialed in.  It called the 4th number prior to the last.  I asked it to call "Bernardo" and it called "Herman" instead.  I went to the voice menu for help and chose "Voice Assist" off the menu and it redialed a phone number from my phone log.  Other malfunctions but what's the point?Anyway, I called JABRA and they told me I would get reset instructions in my email but I never received them.  What a complete joke.
4	1351468800	HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE PRODUCT ITSELF, BUT WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE COMPANY.  I WENT ON THEIR WEBSITE TO REGISTER THE PRODUCT, FOR A, COMPLIMENTARY,  FREE YEAR OF VOICE ASSIST.THEY ASKED FOR A CREDIT CARD, WHICH I FOOLISHLY GAVE, AND THEN I TRIED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM, VIA EMAIL AND PHONE,  TO MAKE SURE I WOULD NOT BE CHARGED DURING THE FREE YEAR. WELL, THEY CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD, AND I HAD TO HAVE AN INQUIRY MADE THROUGH AMERICAN EXPRESS.  AND FINALLY GOT IT TAKEN CARE OF.  VERY POOR CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.
4	1351296000	The product is most excellent for me, while driving I use it with my Iphone for podcasts.The only problem is it looses FM in large metropolitan areas.Perhaps there is nothing Jabra can do to compensate.
5	1351123200	Works great and was shipped fast. It is loud so I have no struggle with any conversation. I definitely recommend this item.
5	1351123200	This product is awesome!!! The reviews prior to me buying the Jabra said it all. The sound is clear. You can transmit your call through your car speakers. It plays music straight from your device and it is simple to set up. My most favorite part of the product is that you can ask it "Jabra" for a list of available commands, just in case you might not remember the exact phrasing of the command you want. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to free up their hands while driving. What a great investment.Did i mention that I have had this product in my vehicle for over a month and I have not even had to charge it once!!!
5	1350777600	The freeway works great as a conference call speakerphone for our construction sites. The Bluetooth works very well from over 50 ft from the unit.
1	1350691200	I purchased this product several months ago and I have been disappointed. I regularly read reviews so I thought it may be important to write one on this product. I can hear the person I am talking to loud and clear, however they can never seem to hear me. I have tried moving the system, yelling, talking directly into it and nothing seems to work. It is very frustrating as I usually just have to end the call because they cannot hear me through the mic.
4	1350518400	This was a great purchase. The speakerphone is very user friendly, the sound quality is good, and the battery life is long. I wish that the fm feature worked better or that it has an adapter to the car apeakers to play music.
1	1350086400	Be warned - This item will only pair with one device. Instructions say it will pair with two devices but it does not. Wanted to use it with two iphones but it will only pair with one.
4	1349827200	I'm using my Nokia lumia800 cellphone with this , The sound is good , connection is very fast .but there is some bug:When you connected  two device useing this bluetooth , after you poweroff it , next time  if only  one device connnected,the jabra freeway will searching the 2nd device on time, when you play music through it ,you will find the sound paused very frequently.The resolution:1: waiting for new firmware to fix the bug.2: connect the 2nd device.3: reset the device,clean up the device list in it, make new connection with your cellphone.(watch the manual).Anyway it's very worth to buy and use it.
4	1349740800	I have been using mine in the car now for the last 5 months. This is a great little speaker with excellent sound quality and brilliant for making voice activated calls.
5	1349395200	I can honestly say I researched and shopped around before I decided on this device. I was very excited to buy it and to use it. Once I got it , I charged it for 1 1/2 hour. After that I paired it with my iPhone. That was super simple. I love the jabra freeway . It's so clear and no one ever knows I'm driving while I'm talking to them because of the great sound quality. It's never failed me even on long drives. I've had this for over 1 month and use it everyday and I have yet to recharge it. So the battery is amazing . I recommend this to everyone
4	1348790400	First of all, this product is great for calling up people. The speaker volume is good and people on the other side were always surprised that the voice was so clear when I told them I am driving. So a great product if this is your primary use case.Its also great to listen to podcasts, audio books from your bluetooth device. Its ok to listen to songs. The speakers do a great job for their size, but eventually they dont really do justice to the songs. Anyways, its better than messing with the factory wiring on cars which do not have the latest stereo features.I have two major annoyances with this product:1. Battery Status: You have to press the voice button and say "battery" to figure out how much time is left. The bad part is that this works only half of the time. I even recorded its own "battery" prompt and played it back and even then it could not recognize the word battery. So this sucks!2. Low Battery Alert: This is a really irritating feature when you are running low on battery, it will keep on irritating you with "low battery" message after periodic intervals. This sucks because you lose out on conversation because the channel draws a blank at this stage. I wish they could have given just one warning and assumed that people are willing to take a chance. Its not like the car is going to run out of fuel.Overall highly recommended for people who do not like things to be stuck up their ears!
4	1348444800	The FREEWAY arrived quickly in the original package and accessories.  I paid less than what guys on the big auction site were paying.  They obviously don't check Amazon before placing their maximum bid.  The FREEWAY has made my driving experience much better.  I use both the internal speakers and the FM radio.  I found the best way to use my FREEWAY is to leave it on and let the auto feature turn it on and off as I get in and out of the car.  I had to search a lot to find an FM frequency that worked well, but I was able to find one.  Occasionaly, I stream audio from my Samsung Galaxy S 3 to my FM radio and it sounds okay.  The sound is not as good as the regular FM Radio, but when I want to listen to something else, it comes in handy.  I have had some complains from people I call, that there is occasionally a lot of background noise on the other end of the call.  I am very happy with and feel safer using the hands free FREEWAY while making calls from my car.
2	1348444800	I've been using my Freeway for about 3 months and it's simply junk. It holds a decent charge, but it doesn't do half of what is advertised. It's essentially just a fancy bluetooth headset but a speaker phone rather than a headset. The battery holds a charge, but is temperamental and prone to interference. It doesn't work with Skype on an iPhone at all. There's a lag when speaking, so often the beginnings of words get chopped off.  I'd pass on on this and try to find something that works better.
4	1347580800	I purchased the Jabra Freeway (JF) about two months ago to have handsfree phone connectivity in my Mazda Miata convertible and Honda truck. Both 2007 so they didn't have the technology. The phone calling and interface of the JF is smart and easy to use. Detects the phone as you come close to the car and turns off a few moments you exit the vehicle. The battery life is great and charges in short time. Phone conversations are clear and most people can hear what I am saying though I have gotten complaints that I sound as though I am in an empty hallway.This JF has come a long way in the personal handfree device market, but still lacks that bridge that full fills similar characteristics of an on board factory installed system. The surround sound speaker is not very good, and is loud enough only for the driver seat. Hearing voice calls through your FM station is difficult and not very clear due to a weak signal coming from the JF unit. Streaming music through bluetooth as well suffers in the similar way.Overall the system is solid and I would recommend it to those looking between the Motorola and other devices, but it still has a ways to go. Not exactly as advertised in the real world condition, but good enough to get you by.
3	1347235200	I ordered this for our 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan which didn't have uConnect.  The $109 was nice compared to $550 to get uConnected added to that Van.  Ordered from Amazon on 8/29/2012 and had it on 9/1/2012, so AWESOME Amazon as usual.I had my DroidX paired to it in seconds, so that was nice, and it downloaded my address book with no problems too.  I think the biggest bummer I found was that the Freeway has no way of making calls itself, instead you have to say "Phone Commands" which uses whatever voice features your phone has.  My DroidX honestly has horrid voice to text features, and it's never worked very well, so I'd say 1 out of 3 times I say "Call Blah Blah Mobile" it tries to send a text message or something else.  The ad's for the Jabra Freeway though didn't really elude to this, so I assumed it would work like Ford Sync or MOPAR uConnect and do everything within the Jabra Freeway since it has a copy of the phone book.  I haven't tested the Voice Assist service though, so maybe I'll change my tune after I test that.Also the FM transmitter sounds great, but I've found it frustrating on two accounts.  First if you hit FM it turns on, but if nothing gets transmitted, like you're not in a call or not playing audio, it turns itself off in like 20-30 seconds.  This is frustrating if you hangup from one call and take longer than the timeout to place a second call, or if your music is streaming but is buffering for a while.  I just would assume if you push FM to turn it in it should stay on until you turn it off or the unit powers off, but that's not the case.  I've contacted support on this since I find this to be a major bug and the reason it's getting 3 out of 5 stars.The only other thing I don't care for is there's no way to disable Voice commands while in a call.  So for example if I'm talking to someone and want to turn on the FM Transmitter I have to wait for a break in the conversation and ask the person I'm speaking to to hold on, then hit FM, and listen to it announce "FM On Transmitting on 88.3 Megahertz" which takes about 6 seconds too announce.  Ideally I'd like FM to just turn on without the announcement when I'm in a call, but there's no way to set this.  Voice can be turned off all together but this disables all voice features which isn't what I'm after.This isn't to say the Jabra Freeway is horrid, the sound is great, the motion detection works wonderfully when I get in and out of the car, and the sound quality is wonderful.  It's definitely worth getting, but these few things I noted are what, for me anyway, create some frustration that could've been avoided.
4	1346630400	Controls are very responsive and the connection occurs seamlessly rather quickly.  Plays music off phone fine but many times doesn't understand a simple "stop" command.  Many times it will then call voice assist or redial last number(!).  I don't understand why it interprets all of that from simply speaking "stop" to cease playing music as I get out of the car.Otherwise, this is the second unit I bought for a second vehicle and for the price it is a very superior product.  Highly recommend it.
1	1346371200	This product was very disappointing.  The quality of sound was very poor when I tried to run it through the radio.Lots of static.  The radio would come through at times with the static and I could barely hear the person on the other endof the line.  I tried troubling shooting and that didn't work.  I called the company and they told me what to do to fix the problemand that didn't work.  Also, as soon as I started using it, I had problems with my Android.  It started dialing on its own and would not shut off.My phone would pick people from my contact list and just start dialing the numbers.  It also started to email a particularprofessional list-serve I am a member of and I could not stop it or shut it off by using the hangup button, back button or power button.I actually watched the words appear on the phone as though someone hacked into my phone and was typing it from another location.I did not touch my phone and was horrified to see that it was calling and emailing my professional contacts.  The only way to get it to stopwas to rip the battery out.  I never had a problem like this with my Android until I hooked up the Jabra Freeway.  Even though I cannot be sure,I have to believe the significant problems with my phone and the installation of the Jabra Freeway are connected. I ended up having to get anew phone all together.
5	1346371200	Buy it ! Does more than what it says it does.  The paid service (free year) is really a fun feature great job on reading email. Wont be a hard choice when I have to pay for it, worth it to me.. IPhone 4s is a perfect match with it.here would be my one issue. You have to touch the phone( that's a no no in CA),  if you need to ask Siri another question. Need some way to command her back without having to keep asking for "phone commands".  if you are looking....buy it. it's sweet, smart, and sound really groovy when playing pandora!!!
5	1345766400	Before buying this product, I didnt know what the FM transmitter function was. I connect to the speaker with bluetooth on my phone and then set the Jabra to an unused frequencey and I can play any music from my phone over my car speakers. This is by far the best set up that I have com across. Theres no wires involved and the sound is really good. I put the device on my visor so it is close to my antenna, this is very important for the best sound quality.Everything else works as expected for the phone functions.
5	1345593600	The Freeway speaker works great, as soon as i get in the car, it connects automatically. it could get really loud sometimes that i have to lower the volume. Very safe to drive and speak.
4	1344902400	I purchased this for my girlfriend because she does not like to talk on her phone while driving and she drives a long way to work. With this, she feels safe and is able to make calls on the go. We have had this a week and are pleased with the sound quality and functionality. I would recommend to anyone who could use a hands free device.
4	1344643200	I recently bought this speaker phone after trying several headset bluetooth headsets with my Galaxy Nexus from Verizon. I wear hearing aids and was having trouble hearing the phone commands on the headsets.I have been very pleased with the purchase. The volume and sound quality on the speaker are very good.  I have used the FM tranmitter and found it to be very useful, though the sound quality is not what you get from a regular radio station.  I love the automatice on/off feature.  It makes it very easy to get going in the car with out having to take time to turn the system on.  Battery life has been outstanding, though I do not use the system a lot, mainly to and from work.  The unit recognizes my voice commands consistently. I was hesitant to spend at the upper limit of bluetooth speaker phones, but I am now glad I did.  I am very pleased with the purchase.
3	1344384000	The speaker part of the device is great. The sound quality is good, and it does allow me to hear calls well even with both Air conditioning and the Radio playing in the car. The downside is the microphone. I find myself either sounding very distant even with the device mounted on the sun visor above the driver's seat, or having to repeat myself because it is hard to hear what is being said. There are a lot of features that I am still not using as I haven't taken the time to synchronize the extra features with my phone. This is my first foray into the use of Blue Tooth as a means of establishing hands free calling, and I can say that the convenience is nice, but the microphone needs improvement. The battery life is great. I have charged the device twice and it has given me about twenty five hours of talk time. I like the portability. I like being able to use it as a speaker phone for conference calls. We do a bi monthly internet radio show, and it has been useful when we have folks call in to the show as it is much easier to understand our callers than it is over the phone's built in speakerphone. Realistically the only complaint I have is that microphone, but because of that I cannot say it is a great device. Based on the price I would recommend shopping around before committing to this device.
4	1344297600	I have had this for a month and it works really well. I love the fact that it can pair two phones at the same time, so both my wife and I can use our phones together. The call quality is great. I haven't tried playing music through it yet. The only reason I gave it a four is because it was not able to import my contacts and the process of importing kept on repeating without any luck. So, finally I gave up on it. I really love the motion sensing feature and how it automatically pairs with our phones when we enter the car. The noise canceling feature is also great. Overall, I am satisfied with the product.
4	1344211200	This is clearly a great product.  Well made.  Not flimsy.  Sound is good for voice communication.  Responds to commands well.  Powers on and off as I enter and leave the car.  Very impressive.Here's a some reasons I am not giving it four stars.  I was given the impression that I could control my iPhone's music player using voice commands.  Only partly true.  If the Jabra output is selected on your iPhone so you are streaming music through the device, then you can stop, skip, play, etc. using voice commands.  But once  you switch your iPhone to playing through you car stereo dock, so it plays through your car's stereo system (and, by the way, NO comparison in sound quality, as the tiny speakers built into the Jabra are fine for chatting but not for high fidelity sound) then you lose voice control.Second, sometimes the Jabra takes over the iPhone and begins playing music through the Jabra speakers even though I have not manually made that choice.  This forces me to remove my iPhone from the glove box and manually switch it back to playing through the car stereo.Neither of these are a deal breaker.  I am very much enjoying the hands free phone use and my callers and I both experience excellent sound and little noise.  If I had to do it over again, I might have opted for the more affordable $39.00 unit as it seems to do nearly the same jobs as this more expensive model.  Overall, I am extremely impressed.
5	1344038400	Extremely easy to use. Simple to set up two phones at once. This one came with a free 1 year subscription for Voice Connect. Phones automatically connect when you get in the car.  If you don't like what you hear on the radio, you just need to press play on your iPhone iTunes and it automatically plays through the unit's speakers!  Of course it is not the same sound quality of your car stereo (for most cars), but it does the trick.
1	1343779200	Nice size, easy set up but it does not easily understand commands.  Much repeated effort to call out.  In coming calls no problem,
5	1343001600	Received Bluetooth on time. Very easy to set up and understand. Works Great! The second you enter your vehicleit announces that you are connected. The commands are very clear and easy to follow. I would definetly recommendthis product as an alternative to a built in unit.
4	1342656000	This is a great sounding bluetooth speakerphone for your car. It clips to the car visor, pairs easily with any phone, you may or may not have to enter a security code - most phones pair with just a push of the button. You can pair up to 2 phones - the last one is the primary phone. It starts up quick and the batter lasts 14-15 hours.The speakerphone is pretty decent and fairly loud - it's good for playing music too in a pinch. In fact, if you are on a road trip you can unclip from your car and use as a portable speaker - for a small sized room.The best thing is that it turns on when it senses a phone nearby or you switch on the car. All incoming calls are hands free but for outgoing calls you will have to hit the voice button to start giving it commands. I am not too happy about the placement of the buttons as it's sometimes difficult to hit the Voice button while driving and very easy to hit it when you're just flipping down your visor. It pairs well with Siri voice commands for iPhone 4S. It also allows you to play your music through car speakers through the FM Transmitter but it's hard to find a free channel with no interference in cities.The VoiceAssist is free for the first year with purchase on this device. It allows you to hear voice texts and post to Twitter and Facebook. If you have an iPhone 4S with Siri then you don't need to use VoiceAssist for calling numbers by name such as "Call Home or Call Mom". I have bluetooth in my car  so I had hands free when a call came in. However, for outgoing calls each number has to be programmed individually into the system through a painstaking process so I prefer to use this Jabra device for voice calling.If you are not planning to use the Voice Assist features Jabra Drive or Jabra Cruiser2 will save you some money. I have the Cruiser 2 and the speakerphone on it has great sound quality. Don't buy any of these systems for FM Transmission as that is not very good quality.
5	1342137600	I purchased this March of 2012 and on the occasion of its second charging I decided now was the time to write a review.RIDICULOUS battery life.  I'm not kidding. I put this in the car at the beginning of March.  It has never been switched off and is just now on its second charging.  That means better than two (2) months on a single charge.  I don't know what the exact full standby time is but the talk time is 14 continuous hours.  5 Stars for battery use.I don't get the negative comments about the speakers.  If you expect an "aural experience" of Bose like sound quality with 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround then turn on the car stereo and stop using a speakerphone as an entertainment device.  For calls, the Freeway is outstanding.  The callers voices are as clear and as loud as you would expect from a $400.00 conference room hands free set up.  Extraordinary voice quality and volume enough to make you turn it down.  From the recipient's end:  They don't even know I'm on a hands-free let alone a cell phone.  The noise cancelling on this is really nailed down.  5 Stars for volume, sound and voice quality.Connecting phones could not have been easier or faster.  First phone was a Droid and current one is an iPhone4.  Switch on the phone Bluetooth, turn on the Freeway, then follow the voice prompts from the freeway.  30-60 Seconds is all it takes.  The unit has a motion sensor that disconnects from the cell phone after ten or so minutes of being stationary.  This means you leave the car and after a few minutes the Freeway goes to sleep.  Conversely, when you get in the car and start the vehicle moving the motion sensor immediately turns the Freeway back on and re-connects to the cell phone. In other words:  Turn it on and forget it.  It will turn itself off and on without your help.  5 Stars for Bluetooth connectivity.(I just realized this is all out of sequence but what the heck.)Mounting is a no brainer.  It is very light weight, downright tiny in size and has a double bail wire on the back.  The front of it curves to match the contour of the driver's sun-visor.  Slid it on the visor and that's that.  It has not slipped, bounced, or moved in any way since it was installed.  I took it off this morning and it left no marks on the visor.  In place, tucked up on the visor, it is almost impossible to see from outside the car.  No advertising for the bad guys.  5 Stars for size, weight and mounting.It has a list of voice commands built in you can access by pressing the "voice" button.  It also expands to include voice commands resident in the given connected phone.  Any/all voice commands for my droid and iPhone4 work through the Freeway.  Very cool.  Someone made mention that it's not a true hands free as you have to push the phone bar at the front of the Freeway to place a call.  Really? OK so you do have to actually touch it and maybe someday we'll be able to use thought commands but for now:  Once you bump the bar it asks you for a command and from there forward it's all hands free.  Granted you can't use it with the windows open driving 70mph down the interstate but without that kind of tornado like wind-noise, the voice commands are flawless.  5 Stars for hands-free.The "Voice Assist" package that came with the unit was free for one year. It is a third party vendor service and is frankly silly.  The service could be used from any phone or hands-free device and actually has nothing to do with the Freeway.  If you're a social networking techno geek you may enjoy the service but if you're not, don't waste the time and effort.Bottom line:  A super high quality hands-free unit that does what you want the way you want with no apparent shortcomings or vices.  So when was the last time you could say that about an electronic device?  This is the real deal.  Get one.
5	1342051200	I have had my Jabra Freeway for about 3 weeks and am totally sold on it.  I wish I was as sold on myVerizon Samsung phone.  All the problems I have had are with the phone.  It keeps shutting itself totally off and of course when it does the Jabra disconnects, which of course it is telling me to turn the darn phone back on.  The phone should be as hands free as the Jabra. Not a single problem with the Jabra, so I think I shall either get another phone or maybe cell provide, or both.BBaker7958
5	1341878400	I bought this because I got a ticket for driving and talking on my cell phone.  This has been very easy to use.  It tells you verbally when it is off and on so you don't have to guess what the settings are.  I knew if it was not convenient I would not use it.  But it has been great.
1	1341792000	Do not get this product. The device is terrible. It only tunes in to one radio station and reception is about 60% good. It gets worser when driving around, with recep of 10-20%, minus the radio station keeps toning in with it's program. This product is terrible and I recommend singing your on song live before spending $100 on garbage.
4	1341705600	I really like this Freeway Speaker Bluetooth Speakerphone.. I purchased it because it has the feature of answering text messages and send text as well. I have Iphone4 and did not realize that this feature is for Iphone 4S only, but otherwise its an excellent bluetooth. Sharp sound, clear as a bell. no noise interference. Great product.. and I love the that I received before the time alotted me.  Thank you
4	1341532800	Easy to set up and use. Speakers are not very good for listening to music from my I-Phone but ok for incoming phone calls-hands free for safe driving. The best set up is to transmit music to car stereo via an FM station although it takes time to locate a station that does not have interference from other radio transmissions. The battery lasts long, about 8 hours of listening. it's nice that unit turns off once you leave car and I-Phone gets beyound about 15 feet from speaker. You can't use FM transmission when charging battery for some reason? I got their best model because of high quality speakers which was not wort it. Probably save money going with mid priced unit, as long as you can transmit to FM stereo which is my favorite feature.
5	1341100800	I can't rave enough about this device. I have a Blackberry and hardly anything works with a Blackberry anymore, but this device did! I have been buying Jabra devices for more than 15 years and I have never, NEVER been dissapointed by them. This device works so well, no one can tell I am driving in my diesel pickup while using this device.  The device lasts for at least a week on a single charge, and I love the way it knows when I exit my vehicle and turns itself off to conserve power and then when I open the door to start driving again, the device powers up and is ready to go!  Thanks jabra for making the best stuff out there!!
5	1340755200	This device is wonderful it works just like Jabra advertises plus it works with SIRI on my wifes iphone 4s like it was built for it, streams music from pandora on the phone through the fm on the car stereo! Even with the top down on the convertible you can still hear and talk normally. Highly recomend this for anyone not wanting a citation for using handheld device while driving!
4	1339804800	I purchased a Jabra Freeway after reviewing almost all the other options.I based my decision on features and Jabra's product reputation.I couldn't be happier. I works great, the call sound is excellent and the FM play thru the radioworks very well as long as your FM station is clear.Highly recommended.
5	1339027200	Best Bluetooth Speakerphone I have ever used. Connection is easy and battery life exceptional. With many states now requiring hand-free cell phone use, it is an essential accessory for those of us who do not have built in hands-free Bluetooth in our cars.
5	1337731200	Love it!  Works just as described.  It turns on when I get in the car and now I can have personal and work phones connected at same time.  Volume does not seem to adjust very well but that's okay that it is a little louder than I want.  Good buy for the money. Cost a lot more at local electronics stores.  Like saving money and I would suggest to a friend.
4	1337385600	The Jabra Freeway Speakerphone is a great hands free unit.  I was worried about the sound quality in the car, but it works amazingly well.  The car noise is a minimum, and is clear for both the sender and receiver.
5	1336867200	This is one of Jabra's best speakerphone products. It is so great, I use it in the house and the car.  The volume is much louder than that of the iPhone so I use the Jabra FREEWAY instead of the speakerphone on the iPhone.
5	1336176000	The best car speaker phone ever! !!!  I've had good ones before like the blueant Bluetooth.  There's no comparison with this one!!!  The Ferrari of Bluetooth! !!!
5	1336003200	I read other reviews and felt very comfortable purchasing this through Amazon.  This unit has amazing sound and build quality.  Some reviewers complained that this unit is not 100% hands-free becasue you have to press some buttons to activate some functions.  This may be true, but its minimal, and come-on already, its located right there on your visor and has very easy-to-use and responsive buttons.  Also, I read that the voice-control feature does not work too well, but I have NOT experienced this either. They work very well as long you know the "lingo" (commands). Overall, I am very please with this blutooth car speaker!
5	1335830400	I'm just saying that because I don't want to jinx it.  My previous bluetooth, a Motorola, was crapping out on me.  The volume suddenly got lower and I couldn't hear people very well.  This product has met or exceeded all of my expectations.  I can hear EVERYONE clearly.  The volume on this is excellent.  Also, everyone can hear me just fine.  I drive a subcompact car which is fairly quiet but can get noisy at highway speeds.  So far, so good.  It was a good decision to buy this device as I hate those "in the ear" bluetooths.
4	1335398400	I purchased this product to satisfy a company requirement for hands-free cell phone use in vehicles. I also thought that it might work well as an external speaker for my smartphone. The setup was very easy, instructions are clear, and the feature set is quite well thought out. The sound is not stellar, however, so if you are looking for a boombox or high fidelity toy with mega bass response this might not be your cup of tea.In practice, once things are set up (as I said, it's very easy to set up), I get into the car, the system senses me and links to my phone via Bluetooth, announcing that it is turning on and connecting. When I get a phone call it produces a very balanced sound and allows me to just talk normally; callers have said that voice quality on their end is very good. You can also play music from your phone through the speakers; not very much bass response in that case, but if you are playing music and a call comes in the system will mute the music so that you can take the call and will unmute the music after you hang up. I have not tried using the device to transmit through my FM radio, although that is available. The system turns itself off after you leave you car, and waits for your return to come online again. I have not activated the online subscription that comes with the unit, that feature allows you to dial by voice, and do other things just by telling the unit what you wish to do.The verdict, well worth the price I paid, probably smarter than I am, not perfect sound, but a clever and sophisticated addition to your toolset.
4	1335398400	I've gone through a few BlueTooth systems before.  I found for the ear piece systems, I never felt like putting them in my ear before hand since I rarely get calls on the road anyways.  Not only that they were a pain in the ass to charge up. So I moved on to speaker style BlueTooth systems.  They were all tinny and difficult to understand.Then came the Jabra Freeway.  I've heard great reviews about it even though it was a little pricey, I took the plunge.  And this is what I found.  In some ways it works fantastic.  But on the other hand, you'll find a huge terrible design mistake.On the fantastic side:1) It's loud and can be used as a bluetooth speaker!2) Battery lasts a long time3) Charges back up quite quickly4) It verbally tells you who is calling5) Voice commands* allows you to do cool things (this also shows up on the utterly terrible side)6) FM Transmitter!On the utterly terrible side there's only one thing.  The voice commands. Yes it's in the fantastic side too but it's caused me no end of frustration.  This might be specific to just me but it's completely unreliable.  One of the biggest concerns is it does things immediately without asking for confirmation.  For example say you want it to tell you how much battery life is left.  You say "Battery".  While you wait for it to tell you your battery life you might suddenly hear a ring tone and well, Jabra Freeway decided you ACTUALLY said "Call my boss" and look, there your boss is on the line now!  I tried "stop music" before and it immediately called a friend of mine.  "Stop" is nowhere near "Call" and "Music" was nowhere near my friend's name.  I tried "stop music" again and yep it called him again.  I found out later the command is just "stop" but "stop music" shouldn't be calling ANYONE.  I tried "Battery" which normally works fine for me but once it started playing music off of my phone instead.  This issue wouldn't be so bad if it said "Calling XXXX, is this correct?"  But no, it skips this which is a problem when it's horribly inaccurate at times.On the not so great side, the FM Transmitter like all FM Transmitters due to FCC laws is weak so you have to be lucky to find a station that this will work with if you're in an area with a lot of radio stations. You can't knock the Jabra for this because it's not their fault, but for those of you who are eager to use the FM Transmitter, realize that it's very dependent on where you live.  Also I think the microphone isn't so great because the few times I've talked on the phone with it the other side said I sounded a bit... weird but I was totally understandable.
4	1334966400	The product is very decent for the price.  It does all that it says it does with one small exception.  Playing music through it at lower levels is fine playing music through it with the volue turned up at all just makes the speakers crackle. The only other thing I have had an issue with is if you are just going into a store where you parked up front turn the unit off because if you get a call while close enough to the car the iPhone tends to hold the connection with Jabra and you can answer on your phone but you can't hear them because they are talking to you via the jabra in the car and not the phone speaker.  For phone conversations while driving the item is perfect, and gives crystal clear phone conversations without having to hold the phone.  For the one bad things with the music, and the having to shut off jabra when I pull into a convenience store I gave it 4 stars.  All other features are 5 star on this unit.
5	1334880000	I have a 2005 Honda CRV. After calling the Honda dealership to see if they could install a bluetooth system, the service rep informed me that they could not but suggested the JABRA Freeway. I ordered it, promptly received it, and I have to say I am incredibly impressed. As others have stated, all I had to do was charge it, clip it onto my car's visor, turn it on , turn on my phone, and voila, within seconds, my phone was connected and ready to place and receive calls. I have an Apple 4S phone. Because of the Siri feature, all I have to do is press the voice button, say Phone Command, and immediately you hear the "ding" that is Siri, and you ask her to call whatever number you want or you can send a text.  I have decided not to utilize Voice Assist. With Siri, the only thing I can't do is receive a voice text, send emails, or post to twitter or facebook which I personally have no need to do. As I said, I can call, receive calls, and send texts. The speaker is loud and clear, and individuals I have called have said they have no problem hearing me on their end. Though some have stated it is not completely hands free, it is 99% hands free, and the only time you find yourself pressing a button is to answer or end a call, or place a call. Considering the inexpensive price, and the excellent design, it is well worth it. I hate to think of what I would have had to pay if it were possible to install a full system. I haven't tried the music feature yet, but for my purposes, it fits the bill. One more thing. A colleague and his wife both have system installed Bluetooth systems in their car. While the JABRA freeway will pair up to 2 phones, their expensive factory installed systems will only read one phone. That's a cool plus for JABRA.
5	1334880000	this is a great product.it dose  what i want and is hands free.i bring it in from my car and use it indoors too.
5	1334534400	I have an iPhone 4S.  I charged the device, put it in the car, linked with my phone and have used it effortlessly since.  It rings right through the device.  I just touch the phone button and answer a call.  Touch it again and it hangs up.  The sound quality is great.  I can hear and understand the person I am speaking with.  It just works.
5	1334534400	I purchased this speakerphone so that when I travel for work, often 3 hours/trip I can still have productive conference calls with my office staff.I have have very impressed with the clarity and ease of use. The device works well with my BB Torch and I did not have to load my address book which was a huge relief.It does take some getting used to the commands. You need to remember to first say "Phone Commands" and then wait for it to respond to you before you say  "Call (....)" otherwise it does not recognize the command; but again once you get used to it it works very well.The stand by and talk time has been very impressive and of course the clarity, which is probably the most important part, is very nice.
5	1334361600	This is the Best Bluetooth I've had so far. It works great and is loud and clear while driving. Buy it you'll like it.
1	1334361600	I purchased this item 2/10/12 and, initially, it lived up to the very positive reviews of other owners. But, two months later, the voice commands would not work properly, giving me message mode when phone commands were asked for, or even battery time remaining, as well as, other things; now this item won't even stay synched to any of my cell phones and just disappears from the wireless items available when accessed. I'll return the item and take the financial loss incurred when you receive a defective item from Amazon and have to return it. This whole experience has left a very bitter taste in my mouth with online purchasing of items from Amazon. They could do better.
5	1333929600	It's the best Bluetooth that I had bought, easy to use then I forgot its there totally! good price for 2nd hand but really 'look like new'.
3	1333843200	I had relatively high expectations for the Jabra Freeway, given their reputation for quality bluetooth products.  Unfortunately, the Freeway missed the mark.  The sound quality is good, but volume levels are too low in nearly every situation except sitting still.  The buttons are poorly placed and the power on/off button is difficult to manipulate.  The ability to stream music or podcasts through the car's radio system works poorly (lots of interference) and I've had better luck with a $15 cable from Wal Mart.  Overall, not worth the money and disappointing for a Jabra product.
5	1333756800	I bought one of these because our state just passed a hands-free law. I was worried about getting an after-market Bluetooth device because I drive a diesel truck which can be too loud at times to hear conversations on the handset - much less over a small speaker. Well, I was pleasantly surprised when my fears turned out to be for nothing and I was able to have conversations even while driving on the freeway. It's not perfect, but for an after-market Bluetooth device, I can't imagine that there is much better in terms of call and sound quality. The battery lasts forever!!! I have had it for over 4 weeks and I have not recharged it yet since I bought it (says I still have 5 hours of talk time left). I was so pleased with this device, that I bought a second one for my wife who loves it just as much as me. One complaint though, is that using the FM transmitter for calls or music was terrible - but that has been my experience with every FM transmitter and could be a result of the crowded radio waves in my city.
4	1333670400	This is the greatest hands free yet.  I have purchased several that were just so much junk.  This is easy to set up right out of the box.  Works great.
4	1333411200	This is a great product.  I have used stuff like this in the past and have never came close to this kinda call quality... I am amazed... The FM mod. does not work that well, but just may be the area that i am in...
3	1333324800	Jabra Freeway is a great concept. Some of its features work wonderfully well.The three speakers make it easy to hear and be heard. Music also sounds surprisingly clear through those speakers. I like the feature that connects Freeway to my bluetooth phone upon entering the car. I like the feature that automatically turns off the unit upon leaving the car.  Jabra's customer assistance is also commendable. It's Voice Assist that has proven troublesome, and that's one of the key features that prompted my purchase. Here's my caveat:  Beware using Voice Assist to send emails/texts. I follow the voice prompts and speak slowly and clearly. I don't overcomplicate the messages.I avoid using names that might be interpreted incorrectly (e.g., Don and John, Sean and Dawn).  I even listen to the messages before I send them and, on occasion, rerecord them to make them even simpler.  Unfortunately, recipients receive messages with significant errors 90% of the time. This makes it difficult if not impossible to use Voice Assist to correspond with business associates. If you happen to view the Voice Assist promotional video, these features appear to work flawlessly. They don't. So if you are a "road warrior" and your main reason for purchasing Freeway is to use Voice Assist to send hands-free texts and emails, that feature is unfortunately unreliable, still a work in progress. FYI- I have had Freeway for a week now. I'm debating whether or not to return it. If there is a solution to my text/email dilemma, Freeway is a keeper. If not, I have a decision to make.
1	1333238400	When I first got the unit I had trouble getting it to pair up. E-mailed customer "service" with a question. Their site says they will respond within two business days. So far, five business days have passed. No response to date.Eventually I got things figured out. The unit works as advertised but the service truly stinks.
4	1333065600	The Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone works well in my car.  I have no issues talking to others and they have no issues picking up my voice - minimal background noise with windows up.  Only issue I have is when using the voice commands - not primetime!  Pretty much have to predial on handset/phone prior to using.  Even when a call comes in you may need to pick the phone up and hit answer.  But, overall, the sound is fine.  Setup is easy and I can even play Pandora over the unit and it sounds pretty good.  My hot buttons for this unit was sound quality and it met my expectations.
1	1332979200	The following is what I initially wrote:  "I must be truthful...this item did not function as advertised. Does it work? Yes, but not as satisfactorily as stated. Unable to hold onto any one FM station while in operation and drops auto's sound system function as a result, which was primary reason for purchase. Vendor was NOT quick to return numerous calls for a "Return Code," until I got involved. Not happy with this experience.""CORRECTED REVIEW"I was NOT aware the VENDOR ("alwayz-on-sale") was relocating their business and had their phone line disconnected.  The VENDOR quickly answered my email and immediately provided a return code.  The problems we encountered were with the PRODUCT, NOT THE VENDOR.I removed my unsat rating and want others to know that I corrected my feedback to hold the VENDOR harmless.  John aka "Knightsix"
5	1332633600	This product over-delivers. Not all Amazon gold box "deals" are for best products out there, sometimes the worst. This one's a home run. Thanks, Amazon. It'll streamline how you make calls, keep you way safer. Plus, it won't cause you to look like one of these obnoxious road-turds who's urgency for inane, useless conversation takes precedence over their safety, and, everyone else's.
1	1332201600	I bought this for the FM transmitter, which absolutely does not transmit a signal strong enough to reach the antenna while clipped to the visor.  So that functionality is a failure.The voice prompts are obnoxiously loud and there doesn't appear to be any way to adjust the volume.It does not seem to disconnect or reconnect properly.  Bluetooth seems to randomly disconnect and refuse to reconnect without turning off and on again, but I can't tell if that's the phone or Jabra.It comes with a service, an apparent $60 value, to let you make calls, send and respond to emails and text messages via voice commands, but beyond the first year you have to pay to use it, so no value there. The speakers are moderately terrible, but that's to be expected.  So, on a scale from 1 to 2.54, 2.54 being best... buy something else.
5	1332201600	Finally I don't need to turn on and off my Bluetooth speakerphone every time I get in and out of my car. The motion sensor works great and has made my life much easier. It connects to my phone automatically within 5-30 seconds after in get into my car and disconnects within 10-15 seconds after leaving the car.Sound quality is excellent and is high enough to continue conversation while driving my Civic on the freeway. I couldn't do this on my Motorola T505 without using the FM transmission.I have a Samsung Galaxy SII and it used get disconnected from my T505 as soon as the phone's screen turned off. I don't have that problem with Jabra FREEWAY.Didn't try voice assist. However, I can answer or reject calls with voice command (without pressing any buttons).FM transmission is same as T505. I don't think there is any Bluetooth speakerphone in the market that can perform better than this due to regulatory requirements. Since the speakers on this device are quite powerful, I don't need to use FM transmitter anyway.It's not too big or heavy, but it cannot be carried in your pocket either.Setup was pretty easy. All in all, this is an excellent product.
1	1332115200	I must start by saying overall I like this device.Pros.1. Clear laud sound; don't even have to put the volume all the way up.2. Call is clear to the person on the other end with my window down. Everyone thinks I'm holding the phone.3. Like that it sleeps when im not in the car so I don't have to power it off.4. Long battery life. (Days....) have not had to give it a second charge as yet.,unlike my HTC HD2 phone I use with it.5. Has basic voice commands.6. battery life is given in (talk time), Not (%)7. reconnects to my HD2 when I put it in the HTC car mount without me have to press anything.Cons.1. Voice commands don't understand my accent. Only commands that work for me every time is "battery" & "what can I say" My phone is in a car mount so I can live without the voice commands. But it would have been nice if it worked for me.2. it is said that the battery will not last forever so it would have bean nice if it was user replaceable.1/2 star off because the voice command are not 100% dependable. But the buttons do work. So the voice commands are not needed.2012-06-08 update that made me change it from a 4 star to a 1 star...started playing mp3s off my phone on it alot and the right speaker shorted out.Amazon gave me a replacement and would you believe after some days of playing music on the replacement both left and right speaker have just shorted out, in the middle of playing a track i was really into.this device just cant take the jamming of heavy use.
2	1332115200	After days of reading all that I could from reviews to discussion boards- I finally bought the Jabra Freeway and had so many high hopes for this as a speakerphone for my Honda Element. Here's what I have to say after owning it and using it for a week.Pros:- Great sound quality- very, very loud!- Nice and small, smaller than what you would think in relation to the photo- Nice styling, nice lighted buttons- Great battery power- Great audio promptsCons:- Terrible Noise Cancellation- to test it, I left voice messages on my work phone and each time I called (at various speeds and with windows up/down, etc.)from my car. Overall, the sound was just full of hissing- each time I spoke, hissssssss...I'm sure the DSP was increasing my voice, but along with that came road noise and hissing. My wife and colleagues really didn't appreciate my calls from the car.- Voice Assist- I would advise you not to use the one year- YMMV- I signed up online and for the next 7 days...my phone's voice mail and text were slammed with spam text from Voice Assist, actually it was from some company using Voice Assist and using people's phone numbers.I really was hoping this would have been much better, but it was not. I bought the Motorola Roadster for my wife a month earlier and went with the Jabra due to it's speaker and DSP noise cancellation- her Motorola Roadster did a much better job and no hissing sounds- so I'll be looking at purchasing the Roadster or even the new Roadster 2 but cannot get any information in terms of the difference in the two units- even tried calling Motorola- they didn't know "have you looked at our web site..." wow, really?? As of today, there's still no real information about the Roadster 2...Thanks for reading!
5	1331769600	The Jabra Freeway really exceeded my expectations. This is the third such device i have owned.(One was a Plantronics, the other a Motorola)First, I'll talk about the actual phone call handling abilities of the Freeway - (I use it paired with an iPhone 4S)Other Bluetooth speakerphones i have owned have had relatively poor quality of sound when it comes to phone calls, especially on the "other end" of a phone call. With this one, i made the requisite 4 or 5 calls to test it out while driving, and everyone i called was surprised to find out they were on a Bluetooth speaker phone. Even my wife, who verges on irrationally critical of the sound quality of a Bluetooth phone call, was impressed with the Freeway. She even asked to use it her car, and has since ordered one for herself. That was all the endorsement i needed, but i will elaborate on the strengths. The Freeway has great sound, louder than most, i think. The three speaker design really performs well. In fact, i found myself turning down the Bluetooth volume on my phone and the Freeway when i first used it. With past devices, i have had to turn the volume up on both, which results in an "echo" effect on one or both ends of a phone call. That is not the case here. Calls are clear and as loud as i want them. I drive a full sized truck, and overcoming road noise has not been an issue at all, even while driving on the highway. Everyone so far claims that they have no problems whatsoever hearing me or with the call quality.As for the "Surround Sound" 3-speaker setup of the Freeway -As mentioned above, the sound quality for voice calls is fantastic. One of the main reasons that i bought the Freeway was to take advantage of the A2DP streaming capabilities of the device. Specifically, i wanted to stream audio-books from the Audible iPhone  app to the device. I could not be happier with the results. The speakers perform very well when reproducing spoken voice. Lows are suitably low, and mids and highs are clear. Because of the Freeway, i am able to enjoy A LOT less clutter from the wires that i used to need to connect my phone to my truck stereo. (i still need the phone charging cable, of course) Now, whether or not this device is good for listening to music in the car is debatable. It is a small device. (about the size of two decks of cards laid side-by-side) As such, it does produce relatively rich sound, but by no means is it a good replacement for your car stereo in terms of the robust bass in most music. I was not expecting this at all, so don't consider it a shortcoming of the device. So far, i have streamed audio-books, baseball games, news podcasts, and internet radio from my phone to the Freeway. All work like a charm. Setup was very easy, and the Freeway always recognizes my phone by the time i have my door unlocked and the car started.FM Transmitter -I briefly activated the FM Transmitter to see how well it worked, and it instructed me to turn to an open station. I live in the suburbs, so it easily found a frequency and transmitted without a problem. The sound was clear, but i found that i needed to turn up the radio a notch or two to hear it well. I deactivated this feature after confirming that it worked as i have no plans to use it on a regular basis. I have not tested this feature in downtown Atlanta, though, where the frequencies would be more congested.So far, i have no complaints. The Freeway lives up to, and surpasses my expectations. The connectivity was a snap, the voice and call quality are excellent, the battery life, so far, is robust, and the visor clip is secure and tight. Audio-books sound great, and i have greatly reduced clutter to have a much cleaner look to the interior of my truck. I received the Freeway quickly and with no hassle from Amazon after buying it from the Gold Box Deal of the Day a couple of days ago. I paid $75 for it, but would have no qualms paying the current $100 asking price on Amazon knowing what i do now.
3	1331510400	I received the Jabra FREEWAY as a Christmas gift in 2011. I use it primarily to listen to podcasts from my iPhone as I drive around. I am not otherwise a huge "cellphone in the car" user, but have made and taken several calls with the device.  As a speakerphone, the FREEWAY works well, although it's not quite the "premium" experience I expected, nor is it a realistic music player.FORM FACTORThe FREEWAY is small, sleek, and attractive, as far as speakerphones go. Barely bigger than the palm of your hand, it clips easily to a typical car visor. (note: most visors point the leading edge toward the driver when folded; a few go the other way. If the thin edge of your visor faces the front of the car when it's not in use to shade your eyes, you may have trouble clipping the FREEWAY to it).BLUETOOTHSimply make sure the FREEWAY is on (it will announce "on") when you slide the switch. There is a pairing procedure you can use by pressing the main button, but I've never needed it since the first time, when I entered the device code into the phone. Now, the iPhone pairs as soon as Bluetooth is activated on the phone. I don't have any problem with the range or power of the transmission, even with the phone is a couple of feet away in my briefcase.CONTROLSThe volume and the main "call / hangup / redial" controls are simple and easy to find while driving. They are not tiny "chicklets," but rather large sections of the FREEWAY device itself -- pressing up on the right rear corner raises the volume, for example. There is a slide switch to turn the unit on and off, but that's also fairly easy to find, and you don't necessarily need to find it while driving, because you can leave the FREEWAY "on" all the time, and its motion detection feature will shut it off automatically when you leave the car, and re-activate upon your return. I've been using the switch to turn it on/off manually when I get in or out of the car, though, because it seems to save battery life.VOICE CONTROLSI have not signed up for the fancy subscription service that supposedly lets you dictate e-mail or what have you. That's more than I need to do in the car, and I don't want to pay for it down the line, so I didn't use the free trial. The FREEWAY also has regular, built-in voice controls though. You can ask it what commands you can use, and it will tell you. "Power on / off" works well. However, I find that in a sometimes-noisy car, the voice commands don't always work and aren't enough of a convenience to bother with. For instance, yelling "Power off" repeatedly at the visor instead of sliding your finger along the switch for one second does not seem helpful, and may make you look like a crazy person to other drivers. It is kind of useful to have the FREEWAY talk to YOU, however. A pleasant female voice will let you know when the device connects and disconnects, when the battery is low, etc.BATTERY LIFEJABRA says this unit has "up to" 14 hours talk time and 9 hours standby. I don't think I'm getting that much -- maybe as little as half. As mentioned above, I manually turn the device on and off as needed. It's cool to never touch it and rely on the motion sensor, but I think it stays on more than you need it to in that mode. One thing that's odd is that the unit will tell you "battery low," and then, when you "ask it" how much battery life is left, it will tell you that you still have a couple of hours. But you have to charge it pretty much immediately anyway, because it will keep telling you "battery low" at short intervals until you do. I use the speaker primarily to listen to podcasts, and also have a somewhat noisy car (a sporty hatchback) and find that I  have to turn the volume up quite a bit to hear. This seems to shorten the battery life. If you have a quiet car, and are just talking, your mileage may be better. The unit charges with a small cord that connects to a USB port, which keeps things compact. You can charge in the car with an adaptor.FM TRANSMITTERThis is the feature whereby, if you want, the FREEWAY will supposedly broadcast to an empty station on your car's FM radio. Does not work in my car. Not one tiny bit. We have crowded airwaves here in Orlando, but other FM trasmitters I have tried have worked at least a little. Not the FREEWAY. So I wouldn't recommend buying this product if your plan is to listen to it through  your car's stereo.SOUND QUALITYThis is what had sold me on the FREEWAY. Three speakers, crisp "surround" sound; great for music, the ad says. I have to disagree. Again, my car is a bit on the noisy side. It's a small, lightweight car that sits close to the ground, and the four-cylinder motor is louder than some. That said, I have to turn up the FREEWAY to the edge of distortion to hear podcasts over the normal sounds of the road. It's acceptable for podcasts that consist of talking or interviews, but it's not good enough for music. Maybe, in the hushed silence of a high-end luxury car, it would sound okay, but those cars have built-in phones for the most part. I think Jabra has done consumers a little wrong by suggesting this device is a competent music player. It is not. The speakers are too small, and it simply does not produce enough volume. Voice calls sound fine, but music sounds tinny. Increasing the volume just causes distortion.BOTTOM LINEA nice, compact, feature-laden aftermarket bluetooth hands-free speaker for the car. Useless FM transmitter, so-so voice command features. Fine sensitivity and clarity for handsfree calls. Will also play your voice-based podcasts well enough to get by. Not loud enough or clear enough to play music enjoyably. I'm overall pleased with the device, and use it regularly, and it's good to know I have a decent speakerphone for those rare occasions I need one, but I'm still on the lookout for a better way to play podcasts or MP3s in the car.
5	1331510400	The short version; spend the extra money and buy this unit. I bought it for my wife and we both love it. I doubt there is a better unit out there.The unit is a well constructed package that fits nicely onto your visor, even with a CD holder that I have there also.Setup and pairing phones is simple using voice commands.The Bluetooth functionality with my wife's Iphone 3GS is nothing less than great! We've got two phones paired and it automatically switches between them when a call is received.Voice commands work very well, it's not perfect technology but I haven't seen anything else that's any better than this unit. You can leave the phone in your pocket for receiving calls because you don't have to look at it or push any buttons. When making a call sometimes it doesn't recognize the name that you want to call so then you would have to use the phone itself. If both phones are in the car at the same time voice commands only work with the last phone that connected. There's really no other way that could work; its' not a problem just an observation.Sound quality is excellent both ways; in the car the built in speakers are clear and easy to hear at any speed.At the other end road and wind noise is barely noticeable and the voice is clearly heard from either front seat occupant.There is an FM transmit function so you can play it through your radio but I never like those things; if you travel a lot of miles the selected FM station doesn't remain free of outside station interference. The built in speakers sound great so you don't need the FM transmit function unless you want to stream mp3 music from your phone to the car stereo.Battery life is great. We charge it once a week or so, the talk time is at least 15 hours. It turns itself off it there is no motion for a period of time so standby time is effectively forever.
5	1331251200	The is the best speaker I have used tet.  I had the Motorola speakers and this was much better-battery life and voice.
1	1330560000	I just took this out of the box and turned it on to pair it with my iPhone 4s.  The voice command was so loud, I had to hurry to turn it off. No matter how many times you hit the Vol - button it stays on high.  And not just high, but HIGH.  You can hear it outside the house with the windows closed. I had to hold a thick foam pillow over the thing to pair it. I played music through the speakers and they didn't come anywhere near the default volume of the voice command.  Imagine driving and listening to music and suddenly a voice shrieks at you that you have a call. You'd probably crash into a tree.Jabra says they're "looking into it."  I Googled this and they've been "looking into it" for almost a year and obviously can't figure out a way to change it.Sad to say, I'm returning mine. I was looking forward to using this but it's not worth getting screamed at every time I turn it on or off.PS - There is no toll free customer service # in the US, either.
5	1330473600	Works fine and seamlessly - range is almost too good - when my wife drives up w/ the car it connects to my phone two stories above. Just have to remember to turn it off. Voice saying... "connected" gets irritating after a while...but that's nit picky stuff. It is a good, effective, user-friendly device.
2	1330041600	Outstanding dual mic background noise reduction technology? REALLY?Maybe if you were using it in a high end car with an extremely quiet ride. But not in a Chevy Cobalt and definately not in my work truck. The sound was very clear from callers and the music from my Iphone was great even through the fm transmitter.Callers could not hear a word I said with all the beackground noise.I think Jabra should do a little more homework before advertising noise cancellation.Jabra could make alot of money if they could make a GOOD noise cancelling speakerphone for truckers with the new DOT regulations for truckers being required to use hands free devices only.
5	1329955200	I tried several bluetooth speakers in my car, connecting to my iPhone 4s.  This is the best.Good sound--nice and loud if I need it.  Callers can hear me without me sounding underwater or in a big box.  Integrates perfectly with iPhone Siri.  One very nice feature is the Auto-On/Auto-Off.  I leave the car and it goes into standby, once I enter the car it goes back on.  Has some sort of motion sensor.  Standby time is measured in weeks.  Excellent!  Well worth the exta cost vis-&agrave;-vis its competitors.
3	1329868800	Today, many new vehicles offer built in bluetooth hands-free calling integrated through the audio system.  The Jabra Freeway is made to address those of us without such systems.  It is a stylish, well made unit that is probably a lot smaller than you think it is from the photos.  Its made to clip to your driver's side visor and provide a friendly, voice driven, automatic hands-free experience from the moment you enter the vehicle.  While it does work and some may find it convenient, I feel that it fails on a number of levels - the first being audio quality.I've been usingPlantronics Voyager Probluetooth headsets for a number of years (I own three) and recently I've upgraded to the latestPlantronics Voyager Pro HD.  In testing, the Voyager Pros offered superior audio quality and noise supression when compared with the Jabra Freeway, particularly when it came to what the other party was hearing - callers told me that compared with the Voyager Pros, my voice sounded distant as if I was in a tunnel when using the Jabra Freeway.  Additionally, the callers heard far more road and wind noise (you really can't use the Jabra Freeway with the windows open) - so much so that they asked me to go back to the Voyager Pro with it's extremely effective noise cancellation.  I will say that I thought the caller's voice came though loud and clear on the Jabra Freeway as it has an excellent speaker for it's size, although I felt I could not raise the volume high enough to suit my taste when driving (I have a relatively loud sports car).Another miss for the Jabra Freeway would have been its obvious dual use as a desk speakerphone.  But unfortunately, it does not work well in this role at all.  This is due to the fact there is only one, very directional microphone with a very limited pick-up range.  If you are not directly in front of it, you are not picked up well by the Freeway and the caller on the other end will not hear you well.  This is unfortunate as I previously mentioned the Freeway has an excellent speaker and it would have been great if it could have doubled as portable, home or office desk speakerphone.So overall, your decision to buy one may depend on your needs or preference.  If you want something you can leave in your car and you prefer a speakerphone arrangement, then the Jabra Freeway may work for you.  I personally prefer using the Voyager Pros over the Jabra Freeway.  I can easily carry the Voyager Pros anywhere, I don't have to stay in my vehicle while I'm on a call and they offer superior audio quality.  I just don't see any advantage to using the Freeway in comparison.
5	1329696000	Not a fan of having to plug in a hands-free and attach it to my ear every time I get into the car. I was comparing Motorola to Jabra and noticed a pattern in reviewers' comments that they had to reboot the Motorola after disconnecting a call before making another call. I was also swayed by the three speaker design of the Freeway. I spent the extra money to get what I hoped would be a superior product. After using it for a week, I can report that it operates smoothly and the speaker quality is fantastic. It fits nicely on my visor, the buttons are easy to use, though it operates by voice command most of the time. The battery life js quite generous. It will report the remaining battery time upon voice command. There are no annoying flashing lights to distract you at night. It automatically powers down after you leave the car and reactivates when you enter it with your phone. I use the iPhone 4s. The speaker quality for music streamed from my phone is good, then again I'm not expecting Bose-like quality. The FM transmitter works, but the quality isn't that great as there is alot of interference. I won't deduct a star for that, since the FCC has forced manufacturers to make FM transmitting devices significantly less powerful, so I hold Jabra harmless on that one. Overall, a great product and I would highly recommend it.
5	1329350400	After having a love-hate relationship with the BlueAnt hands-free speaker (sounded like I was in a tunnel), I decided to try the Jabra Freeway.  Much better sound and I love the FM transmitter.  Can listen to my Ipod through the car speakers and/or a phone call. Also, the unit automatically turns off when you leave the car which extends the battery time.  Overall, a very good system.
3	1328832000	If you are looking for a product that is completely hands free then this is NOT  the product you want to buy. This device is a decent bluetooth speaker set good for just calls and nothing beyond it. The FM is really Lousy and the transmission is at best AM. So listening to audio on car speakers is not a pleasent experience.The voice commands also sometimes just freeze.. prompting to pair your phone again with the device. All in all this device is good for calls and calls only.
4	1328832000	I've had my Freeway for a few weeks now and I really like how loud it is, it has 3 speakers on it and they sound pretty good. I am a trucker and it is very noisy in the cab and if the sound is turned up there is no problem at all with hearing it. The Voice Assist works fairly well - alot of times it will start playing music when I ask it to make a call and if I just try using voice commands without the voice assist it rarely works. I also am noticing that the battery life is way way less than what is stated, it says it has a 14 hour talk time but when I get to around the 7 - 8 hour mark it says low battery and shuts down maybe 10 minutes later. over-all i'm happy with it as I don't use voice commands very often and just the battery issue is my main downside.
5	1328745600	The Jabra Freeway is awesome!  It allows me to be handsfree while driving.  It syncs so easily with my iphone via bluetooth.  Great clarity on my phone calls - love that it announces who is calling.  No need to look at caller id.In addition, it has great audio - I use it play my music directly from my iphone and it has a FM transmitter that will play directly through your car speakers.What more could you ask for - Love my Jabra.  It also has a nice talk time length.  It keeps the charge for quite some time.Lastly - my sister in law saw my Jabra Freeway in use and ran out to buy one as well!It is well worth the money for this product and Amazon makes it so EASY to purchase - especially if you are a Prime Member - It cuts down on your shipping time!Enjoy your Jabra Freeway!!
5	1328227200	After a month of use, this thing is great. I do find its not easy to move between cars as I end up hitting the big button and it starts calling my last caller. Battery life is great, it charges with same cord as my DroidX phone (micro USB) and everyone I ask about sound quality reports "great". My DroidX has indicated this device is trying to access my phone book. I hit OK button yet this device does not say "brother" is calling. I don't know why it wants to read my phonebook if it won't convert. I have not tried to tell it to call brother; yet.
4	1328054400	Along with my new Iphone 4S, I decided to upgrade to the new Freeway version of the Jabra. It's a big improvement over my prior Cruiser2. The sound quality is the most noticeable leap, crisp and clear ( and I am slightly hard of hearing). Even the Jabra voice lady's diction is better, less adenoidal! I don't plan upgrading to the voice assist after the free trial, as the Siri lady  on my 4S does the job just fine for finding numbers from my contact list and dialing them. The only problem I'm having is that after the Freeway dials the number, and before it rings, the Jabra lady says "Call ended" even though it begins ringing immediately after. Guess it is just one of her little quirks.And, as others have pointed out, the connection is slow to disconnect after exiting the car, just as the Cruiser2 was.But now with the Iphone, it lets me know on the screen whether to switch to the Iphone. A minor inconvenience, but so much easier than my old set up where it so was much harder to cancel the bluetooth.
5	1327968000	Purchased after doing lots of research and wanted to have the sound quality at its best. Well, I got what I wanted ! Nobody can even tell I am using a bluetooth hands free device. The sound is awesome. Its very simple to use, sets up without even having to think about it and with the Voice Assist program ( have to purchase after one year) its more than I could of ever expected. I can speak in a soft tone without having to direct my voice to the overhead device and there is no background noice for the recepient of my calls. You dont need the car speaker option, nice to have but its so clear as is, I am not sure why anyone would ever use car speaker mode. I am very impressed and the battery life is great. It shuts off when out of range, but you can still simply shut it off to conserve battery. Its range is a little too far and someimes when using my Iphone in the house I am still connected. Just shut off in car overnite and the problem is solved and like I said you save battery. Smartphone users--you gotta try it and I promise you that you will be glad you did. I plan on purchasing two more for my kids so I dont have to worry..great job Jabra!!!
5	1327881600	The Jabra Freeway has exceeded my expectations based on product literature and other reviews. It was very easy to setup and pair with my Verizon Android phone. Despite all the input I received from Verizon "technical gurus" at my local Verizon store, from Jabra technical support, and numerous online forums, I am able to initiate, hands free calling by using the Freeway voice command rather than having to handle the phone and make calls from it as the "experts" advised. When activating FM on Freeway, music can be played through Freeway to my truck's speakers which is preferable inasmuch as the Freeway speaker system is not as good as expected based on product literature and other reviews. I would definitely recommend this product.
4	1327795200	I have purchased several cheaper Bluetooth devices, only to be disappointed with their clarity. Others say it is like talking to me face-to-face on the Jabra. Easy to use as a basic hands-free device. I have been unable to get this device to work through my car's speaker system and would like to be able to choose which phone to use when I have 2 paired with this device. It does NOT come with detailed instructions although you can get some information online.This device has a very good range; the good part being that I can get out of my car and pump gas without it disconnecting me. The bad part is that it continues to stay connected when I go into my house unless I turn the power off. Speaking of power, this device stays 'on' in my car 24/7 and maintains a charge for several weeks at a time depending on talk time. Standby seems like it lasts forever!!Would like to see more customer support from Jabra- maybe then I could figure out how to make the device do all the things advertised. I still would recommend it based on its battery life, clarity and ease of use (for the basic set-up.)
4	1327708800	For a bluetooth phone connection - it is five stars.  Sounds clear and crisp, some of my friends say it sounds better than my phone.  Have only used the text stuff a little and that is three stars.
5	1327708800	When I first received the Jabra My husband told me it sounded terrible - very distorted  I was so disappointed but then I tried different positions and found the sound improved substantially if the visor is down and the unit is toward the window side.  Now, everyone who has heard it says it sounds great!  Delivery was quick and I am very happy with this purchase.
5	1327622400	Perfect solution for car that has no aux input, no bluetooth....I wanted to be able to use 2 mobile phones phones in my very old car.  One mobile phone streams Sirius satellite radio.  The other is my main phone, so I wanted to be able to answer and make calls from it.  The problem I was trying to solve with the phone steaming Sirius was that I couldn't hear the mobile phone if I went about 10 mph.  The problem I was trying to solve with the other phone was that I wanted to make and receive calls hands free.  The challenge I had was that all of the obvious products didn't work with my car, either because they required an aux in-put (such asBelkin Bluetooth Car Hands-Free Kit for Apple iPod touch, iPhone, Blackberry and Android Smartphones, but my car does not have an aux line, or because they just would make or receive calls, but wouldn't also stream music from my mobile device.Somehow, I found this product, and I am glad I did.PROS:- Can pair two mobile devices and switches between the two easily.- Battery lasts a long time - up to 40 days standby, allegedly (I always have mine plugged into power).- Knows when I get in and leave the car !  That is amazing.- VERY loud speaker built in.  I can hear everything on Sirius very clearly now.- High quality sound - not tinny at all.- Streams music with no fading, not distortion.- Gives verbal instructions during pairing, etc. Thank you!  I don't have to read any manual!- After using this every day for 1 month, it has never failed to link up with my phone (or, phoneS if I have both with me).  This is great.CONS:- Buttons are flush, so frustrating sometimes pressing the right button (but hopefully I'll get better at this over time).  Also, buttons are hard to read unless at the right angle.- Expensive solution - but cheaper than having a stereo installed (note that I stream Sirius and music from my mobile device).- Too easy to  push the "redial" button by accident.UPDATE:Another pro - sits nicely on a dash.  The speakerphone is loud enough it can work fine from there.  Plus, you can more easily see the buttons in that position.2nd UPDATE:After 6 months, I tried to update the firmware, but due to the fact that the USB port was loose, I bricked the Freeway.  On a Saturday, I sent an e-mail to Jabra.  The next day, on a Sunday I got a response.  The next day, Monday, they sent out a replacement, which I received two days later.
4	1327363200	Its as sleek as it looks and sounds on paper, bonus battery meter display on iPhone4, double bonus devices will speak its battery level to you! Appears to work very well. Testing streaming music from phone to Jabra, it did cut out a few times but I am more concerned with phone fucntion.So I tested the multiple device (2 phones) function and it works very well. I think the sound is great but dont expect much better than previous premium handsfree devices such as Motorola etc. But it is very functional as a speaker phone and performs as advertises.More time on the road, people say they hear me very well with little road noise.Voice recognition is not perfect a few times the voice command to answer a call does not get acknowledged but more often it works very well even with the music turned up.The only BIG pet peeve I have is when my iPhone4 (iOS4), is initially linked, the other device sounds such as lock, unlock, SMS, etc do get streamed through the speakerphone, however after a period of idle time the jabra goes into standby mode, no notification sounds are played. You will not know. However I believe this is the same with OEM car bluetooth systems.Back to what I found most important, advanced multipoint. Works very well. A little cumbersome if you need to switch the primary handset device (last paired device).Im sure there are other great systems on the market. This is for sure one of them, worth the money.
5	1327276800	This is a great product. I've purchased 2 as gifts and my friends love them.  I would purchase again. It is very clear. Have not had any problems with either product.
1	1327276800	The voice activated dialing rarely works. That defeats the purpose of the unit. You can speak loudly and clearly directly into the system and it still misinterprets what you are saying. I wished that I never invested in it.
5	1327190400	This was a fantastic purchase! Once it's set up, all of it's functionality is virtually handsfree! This single best bluetooth device available right now.
5	1327190400	I highly recommend this product!!! Speakerphone quality is a 10 and the bluetooth integration is flawless. Voice dialing commands work great as well
4	1327017600	I was looking for a single "all-in-one" solution to add Bluetooth, iPod, and navigation to my car without lots of wires or complexity.I use it with an iPhone 4S.The speaker sounds pretty good most of the time although at times I wish it were louder. I drive a Hummer so the device sits probably 18" away from my face which is probably more than it was designed for. The auto on/off feature works well MOST of the time, sometimes it doesn't disconnect right away-no big deal, I simply turn Bluetooth off then on quickly on my phone. The FM function works, however you'll have mixed results in areas with lots of strong radio signals. Changing the FM broadcast frequency is a bit cumbersome (u must go one frequency at a time-I've seen other units find the best frequency for you).People seem to hear me fine. The voice commands don't always work but again in my noisy truck and the device so far away I think it works decent.I didn't pay for the device so it's easy for me to be a little more forgiving. I warned simplicity and a single device so I'm willing to compromise. I'm sure separate devices would deliver better results but I can't stand clutter.
2	1327017600	I got this unit about 10 days ago. I charged it and immediately updated it to the latest firmware. (As of Jan 10) It worked great for the first week. My only complaint was that the units voice was MUCH louder than the phone.I really didn't use the unit that much and when I did, I relied on my phone's voice dialer. So I would say "Phone Commands" and it would then use my phone. My phone is brand new and its voice recognition is fantastic. (Verizon Samsung Galaxy Nexus running 4.0.2)For the last few days, it has been acting strange. I am guessing that there may be something wrong with the microphone. It had trouble with my voice commands. Even when I was able to get it to recognize when I would say "Phone Commands" (this command makes the unit use the phone for voice) my phone could not understand what I was saying. Also, I couldn't hear my phone. Usually, after saying "Phone Commands" I would hear my phone say "Say a command". I wouldn't hear that.The problem is with this unit, as I had to revert to a bluetooth earpiece and that worked fine.Such a shame since it worked pretty well.Oh well, I am now trying a Motorola Roadster.UPDATE: I tried other devices and they were pretty bad. I went back to this device since Jabra mentioned that it should not operate as it was for me. They thought that I had a bad unit. Well the new one does seem to be much better. The speaker quality is not great but better than most all competing products out there. I am just used to my other 2 cars which have Bluetooth built in.UPDATE2: After a year of decent performance. A speaker has blown. The sound quality is horrible now. I have a nice paperweight.
5	1326844800	Works just like it's supposed to, and tells you what it's doing.  Almost like having a Bluetooth-enabled sound system built into the car, but for a small fraction of the cost.  I love it!
2	1326672000	I bought 2 as gifts and I am sorry to say I did not receive favorable opinions of these items. The description stated there would be minimal background noise which has not proven to be true. When I was on a call with one of the individuals that received the product, I could barely hear them because of static background noise. Additionally it is very hard to understand the voice announcements. I nor the receivers of these gifts are very pleased with this product.
5	1326326400	Bought this for my new to me car that has on-star but not bluetooth.  While the on-star until could have been upgraded it would have been over $300 and this unit is a 1/3 of the price.  It is absolutely perfect -- I love it!  My commute is an hour+ so driving and talking on the phone is a necessity.  However, I felt unsafe talking, holding my phone, and driving.  Now, its like the person is sitting next to me.  I can concentrate on the road -- not my conversation and phone.The unit's buttons are very accessible, easy to use, and quite intuitive.  The call clearity is amazing -- for both you and the person you are talk to.  The fm connection is a nice feature, but not needed as the sound is great right from the unit.  One thing I was worried about was the sound when the visor was in use and the units speakers/microphones were pointed away. which happens a lot living in FL.  My worries were unfounded as there is no significant difference either way.  The talk time between charges is quite long; its been up over a week and I haven't charged it yet.  It fits perfectly and is quite snug. It even looks good with my tan and black interior.  I have not been so impressed with a purchase in a long time and cannot believe how much better life is with this unit than it was before.In fact, love this unit so much told all my friends and collegues about it and am getting one for hubby for his birthday -- even though his commute is less than a mile.  It is a must have for anyone who drives --  55 miles or a single mile.
4	1326240000	I am using this speakerphone with a Motorola Android 2, in an '04 Toyota Sienna (minivan). I wanted a speakerphone because I didn't want to be driving with an earphone in (couldn't hear my kids clearly when it was blocking my ear), but didn't want to fumble and fiddle with putting the earphone on when the phone rang.  Also wanted to be hands-free for safety.  Speakerphone option on the phone itself is awkward to activate while driving.  So, bluetooth speakerphone. Although Sienna was rated quiet on the road by "a leading consumer magazine", I have not found it that way.  Especially on the highways (concrete, not in great condition), I have to raise my voice to talk to the kids, sometimes yelling to the ones in the back row.  So I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to find a speakerphone that would work.  With that in mind, I researched, and even called Jabra to ask them which was their most sensitive, yet white-noise blocking, speakerphone.  The rep said this one.So, does it work?  Kinda.  Incoming calls work well, even when on the highway.  One tap, and we're connected.  When I try to call out using voice commands, it sometimes comes up with some wacky ideas about what I want.  Especially if I'm on the highway, and the road noise is high, it can take several tries for it to understand what I'm saying.  I have, on occasion, given up. That said, I can't tell you whether the weakness is in the Jabra, or in my Android voice recognition software.  I have not tried it with another brand phone. People can hear me, I can hear them.  The kids can even talk to dad from the middle row  (and even back row if they speak up), and he can hear them and chat with them. I have taken to warning him as soon as I get on the phone with him, "I'm on the speakerphone and the kids can hear you!" ;-).The features are nice.  Automatically turning on when you enter the car, automatically connecting to my phone (that was a real pain with the earphone; having to pair it every time I wanted to use it).  Bluetooth has a long range; I get about 1.5 blocks from home before it disconnects from my phone (if I left my phone at home, which I tend to do).  It tells you when the battery is getting low, but unfortunately, I think it says it to my kids, as they are usually the first in the car (it announces its status as soon as it is activated by movement in the car).  The other day the battery was depleted, and I'd never heard it say it was low.  On the plus side, it comes with a USB charging cord, which also comes with a connector so you can plug it into your car lighter.  So, no waiting until you get home to charge it.  The cord is nice and long, but for safety's sake, I put it in my center console when it's plugged in.
5	1325980800	This system is amazing!! All you have to do is charge it, turn it on and follow the voice commmands.  The voice commands guides though connecting your phone.  This system allows you to connect 2 bluetooth phones to it.  The speaker on this system is incredibly clear!...I wanted to connect via the FM radio, which you can by pressing an FM button and the system tells you what channel to turn it to, but the speaker on this system was so clear that it worked better then the FM channel which sounded a little snowy and you can hear another radio station.  You can also click the voice button which you can say "call John" and it will call john under your contacts in your phone.  Another great feature was that if you leave the car with the connected phone the system will shut itself off after a while, in order to save the battery.  This system is a must buy for anyone needing a hands free device while driving.
4	1325548800	Small enough to fit in a jacket pocket and gives you a genuine 14 hours of audio. Sound quality is amazing for the size. Note the caveat. If you're looking for serious high fidelity, it's probably not physically possible with speakers of this size. Still, you can definitely hear stereo and the sound is surpringly full and loud. Some music sounds better than others. Jazz sounds amazing. Rock and pop can be a little shrill, but definitely listenable. It's especially great for listening to podcasts. As mentioned in other reviews, biggest downside is the robot menu voice which screams in your ear and cannot be turned down. Why Jabra? Why? It's a tragic flaw on such an otherwise fantastic device. It makes the motion detection function more annoying than useful unless you want to be constantly alarmed by the thing yelling at random about turning off and on or connecting or disconnecting or whatever other tasks it should just do silently.
5	1325203200	This is hands-down the best after-market (rather than vehicle-installed) hands-free device I've used!I have an iPhone 4s, and when I hit the voice button and say "phone commands" it then allows me to communicate with my new-found love, Siri, so I can use all of the commands that I would normally use with Siri.Bluetooth connection was a breeze, I connected my iPhone 4s, and also my iPod nano 6th gen (which I connected using a mini bluetooth transmitter from Kokkia).  What's cool is I can use both devices at the same time!  (e.g. I can be playing music from my nano, and take calls on my iPhone, when the call ends, the nano resumes playing music.  Or if I want to stream from my iPhone I can pause my nano and play content from my phone).The FM transmitter is cool too...obviously you can use it to make phone calls and play the audio to your vehicle's sound system (rather than just to the Jabra's speakers, which do sound great BTW).  What's even cooler is if you do not have an iPod dock in your vehicle you don't need one...  with this device you can either play content on the Jabra Freeway (as outlined above), or click the FM button, and transmit the audio to your vehicle's FM radio!  No more iPod dock needed!!!The one thing that I didn't find particularly helpful was the voice assist application which is free the first year, and a little under $60/year thereafter.  The main reason I opted not to use the voice assist is that I was unable to connect my work email to the service (exchange).  I tried to set-up to a separate mail account (a Register.com hosted email address) and it worked perfectly.  So, if you just need web mail it should work just fine.  The other thing that made me opt out of using voice assist is simply the fact that Siri does most of the same things as Voice Assist anyway.NOTE  I did try voice assist's chat tech support to figure out why the exchange mail wouldn't working, after outlining the problem I entered chat, didn't get an agent promptly, eventually got a window to submit an email request instead...  but it didn't keep any of the information I had previously entered into the chat window, rather than re-typing everything again I thought "bag it" and unsubscribed from the service.
5	1325116800	We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. She installed it the day after and said it was super easy to install, she asked me to call her on it to check how it was working. We could both hear each other great, it displays the number calling and she just loves it. Great gift.
5	1325030400	I have this unit and the old Motorola T505 that I've used for 5+ yrs.The Freeway beats T505 in the speaker department hands down. In fact, it's good enough for me to turn off the FM transmitter when listening to podcasts and use the built in speaker as is, not something I enjoyed while on the T505. You can seek FM frquencies manually up and down or automatically, while the T505 can only do it automatically (used to drive me crazy because it'd land on occupied FM frequencies and used it).Pros:- turns on and connect when I open the door to my car using motion detection.- speaker on the device is loud and clear, with great presence.- Mic is pretty decent- Easy setup- Can manually tune the FM transmitter frequencies- Makes for very good desktop bluetooth speaker if used as one. Clear but not overly bright, bass and with presence, but still a small speaker unit.- Don't have to manually turn unit on/off like the T505Cons:- Takes 15mins to disconnect when I leave my car at work because I'm close enough to the car to still be connected when in the office.- Mic sounds better when mounted above you on the visor not anywhere else.- Weaker FM transmitter than the T505.- The wire visor clip could be better.All in all, I love the unit.
3	1324857600	It's pretty simple, really.  After using the Jabra Freeway for a weekend, I can say that the product is great for use with the integrated speaker.  The speaker is amazing for a product like this and really works well for phone calls.  Automatic connection to the phone seems to work well.What is not so great is the FM transmitter.  We tried to use this to have passengers watch episodes of "The Office" while on a car trip.  We found that the spoken word was often difficult to hear even after maxing out the phone volume and cranking the car stereo to 40 (normally 30 is very loud with commercial FM stations).  After trying many stations that appeared to be dead air, we found that it was impossible to get clear audio that wasn't permeated by quick static interruptions every 5 to 20 seconds.  It became annoying enough that we resorted to using the built in speaker, which meant that not everyone in the car could hear while we were at highway speeds.Bottom line... this is probably the best product of its type out there if you don't bank on using the FM transmitter.  For a premium product, I would have expected all features to work flawlessly.
5	1324598400	I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT. THE DELIVERY WAS FAST AND PRODUCT IS A HOME RUN FOR SURE. HANDS ON THE WHEELS AND EYES ON THE ROAD FROM THIS DAY FOWARD.
4	1324598400	I bought this device to use with my iPhone 3G, and I'm glad I did:-) So far so good!  My phone does not support the voice assist option but if I upgrade to a newer iPhone it will so I'm glad to know the option is available.  I love that it announces most incoming calls since trying to look at my phone's display is distracting and unsafe (or so they say);-)  I tried listening to music through the device's speaker and it works fine but I prefer my current fm tuner (I have an older model vehicle); I have yet to try the FM tuner in the device but once I do I will update this review if there's something significant to report.  It is very sleek looking and well built.  I don't have trouble hearing my callers and they've reported I was very clear as well.  Set up was seamless and it connects each time I enter the vehicle with no work on my behalf, Great Job Jabra!
1	1324425600	This device could not understand my speech on any level. Every command I gave was interpretted incorrectly. I was very disappointed.
5	1324252800	Bought from: BEST BUY, Winnipegafter some research via the web, i finally bought this device a week ago (i had to test it a week before giving a review).i  had searched numerous sites but jabra freeway is the ONLY bluetooth speakerphone that is in the  apple store site so far so i ended up buying it.So here it is:PROS: great sound quality for calls and music (it can be really loud),reception to both ends during calls is phenomenal (even with my windows open during driving so my friends say and i actually listened to one of my voicemails),it works wonderfully with SIRI (just use phone commands and it will sync with your phones integrated voice app) thus making it very handy to make a call, reply or send a text message or email, weather, directions etc so you don't need to subscribe or purchase  the "voice assist feature" that comes with the device, contacts are synced to the device and caller's name will be read out,  phone connects promptly to device as soon as i get in the car,  easy to use no explanation needed.CONS:my phone gets disconnected with the device quite a  couple of times (not turning my bluetooth and/or device off) while driving so i miss a few calls, SIRI can't read text messages though if your phone is locked. (duh?). Ugly designPOINT: worth it.
4	1324080000	I relly like this item. First, the sound quality is awesome. I have used it as a wireless speaker to stream Christmas music from Pandora in my office. Everyone thought the sound was awesome considering the small size.Working with Siri/4S:It pairs fine. The call quality on the other end is superb. People usually cannot tell they are on speaker.Siri works ok, but it takes some pracice on the timing. The Freeway seems to recognize the commands better if you wait a second after hitting the voice button before speaking. Siri requires you to speak right away or it gives up. So I find I need to hit the voice button, wait a second, say "phone commands", listen to the "Activitaing phone commands" dialog, and as soon as I hear the Siri "beep" I need to speak right away.GPS sounds awesome and makes the voices sound a lot more real and full than the iphone speaker. Sending quick texts on this in combo with Siri is nice.Pros:Disconnects when you shut your door or reopen by using vibration sensor.Sound quality is good.Seems to pick up my voice ok for calls. Voice commands require waiting a second after hitting the button though.Can use as a wireless speaker which is cool for listening to music at work and such.Battery life is awasome. Listened to music all day at work 8 hrs straight and I still had 8 hours talktime left reported.Comes with a decent size cord but not really a big deal becuase the battery life is so good.Cons:The default voice is loud with no way to turn it down.The device is larger so you wouldn't put in you pocket and take it with you. Hate to leave it in the car to get stolen.If you take the device down or when putting it on the visor I find myself always hitting the phone button and redialing my last number if it the device is not shut off first.FM transmitter is useless if you have stations from 88.1 to 89 and 107.1-107.9 due to interference. I wish it allowed more options like 87.1 up. When there isn't interference (rural areas) it sounds decent, but most of the time it is pointless. Good news is the sound quality is good enough for music and gps that you don't really need it.Wish I could voice dail without relying on phones built in phone commands or a subsciption service.Follow up 3/3/12:The item is still working ok. I noticed sometimes the begiining of my directions are cut off using it with my iphone GPS program (not sure if it is the speaker or the iphones fault). I also notice my voice is not as clear when using Siri. Siri seems to be a lot more accurate using the built in Iphone 4s speakerphone. Teh speakers themselves arw amazing as portable speakers for my lapstop and lsitening to podcasts...
4	1323820800	This is a great product, but don't count on the Voice Assist program for the voice to text or e-mail.  That was not the biggest reason for my purchase, but I was hoping that it would work well.  It would have been a nice feature to have.  The voice quality and sound quality is great for phone calls.  It works well with the FM frequency also, but sometimes will "drop" the the channel while I am driving, if I drive in to an area where they use that channel.  I am able to play music from my phone through the Freeway speaker (or through the car speakers).I would definitely recommend it.
3	1323820800	Didn't even take it out of the package. This thing is enormous compared to other bluetooth devices. Sent it right back
5	1323475200	The short version; spend the extra money and buy this unit. I bought it for my wife and we both love it. I doubt there is a better unit out there.The unit is a well constructed package that fits nicely onto your visor, even with a CD holder that I have there also.Setup and pairing phones is simple using voice commands.The Bluetooth functionality with my wife's Iphone 3GS is nothing less than great! We've got two phones paired and it automatically switches between them when a call is received.Voice commands work very well, it's not perfect technology but I haven't seen anything else that's any better than this unit. You can leave the phone in your pocket for receiving calls because you don't have to look at it or push any buttons. When making a call sometimes it doesn't recognize the name that you want to call so then you would have to use the phone itself. If both phones are in the car at the same time voice commands only work with the last phone that connected. There's really no other way that could work; its' not a problem just an observation.Sound quality is excellent both ways; in the car the built in speakers are clear and easy to hear at any speed.At the other end road and wind noise is barely noticeable and the voice is clearly heard from either front seat occupant.There is an FM transmit function so you can play it through your radio but I never like those things; if you travel a lot of miles the selected FM station doesn't remain free of outside station interference. The built in speakers sound great so you don't need the FM transmit function unless you want to stream mp3 music from your phone to the car stereo.Battery life is great. We charge it once a week or so, the talk time is at least 15 hours. It turns itself off it there is no motion for a period of time so standby time is effectively forever.
1	1323388800	This speakerphone has a lot going for it, but it has one fatal flaw that Jabra has not admitted to, much less corrected.The problem is that is does not disconnect from the phone when one leaves the car as advertised.Thus one may be in one's house, or a store, and miss calls that are still ringing in the car even though the phone is in one's pocket.Jabra took a week to get back to me on this, and then only suggested that I turn of the unit manually.Bottom line: don't buy this unit until the disconnect feature is made to work as promised.
5	1322611200	I was hesitant to purchase any speakerphone because of the number of poor ratings given to any brand or type.I have an iPhone 4. It is the only "Smart Phone" I have had.Upon receiving the Freeway I:1)Plugged it into my computer and charged it for two hours.2)Upgraded the Firmware.3)Paired it to my phone and turned it off. I don't know if this was necessary.4)Paired my wife's phone.Both paired in less than 1 minute. When I turned my phone back on, the Freeway replied "connected".I placed it in my vehicle and turned it off. It replied "power off".The next morning I got in my vehicle, turned the Freeway on, it replied "power on" "connected".I left home and placed a call. To place a call I tapped the voice button of the Freeway. It replied "say a command". I said "phone command". At which point it connected to the voice commands of the iPhone. (I was impressed. I had never used this feature). I said "call Beth" it replied "two options, home or mobile" I said "home" it dialed the number. The clarity on both ends was great, very clear. My wife hung up first. The Freeway replied "ended" my phone hung up. I reached my destination, put my phone on standby, left the Freeway on and left my vehicle. I returned 1-1/2 hours later. When I got in the car the Freeway stated "connected", so it must have disconnected automatically. It has a motion sensor, when the vehicle is still for a given amount of time it turns off. When it senses movement it turns on.I tried the FM feature which I am not really interested in. The third try at an unused station was the clearest but still had static. Transmitting from a phone to the Freeway and then to the radio, there's bound to be signal loss. I have other options for listening so, for me it's not a problem. The antenna on my 12 year old vehicle is loose and may be part of the problem, not grounded properly.Others have stated it's not hands free because you have to touch a button. It would be pretty slick technology that could differentiate between a conversation and a phone command. At most, one touch to make a call and one to hang up, if the other person hangs up first it's one. How many moves does it take to set the fan and heat, intermittent wipers or cruise control? So, for me, it's about as hands free as it gets.If you want the FM feature you should arrange to use one first and if it's not what you want return it. Otherwise I am pleased with it.Update 1-31-12My wife has had two hands free speaker phones and did not like nor use either. She used my vehicle for a week. The afternoon of the first day, after using the Jabra in my vehicle, she called me to ask me to order a Freeway for her car. Same setup as above.While suffering from a head cold the Freeway ask me to repeat a command, several times, but otherwise it works very well.I set it up as numbered above.10-14-12I am still very pleased with the Freeway.I have a voice assist GPS app on my iPhone it works automatically with the Freeway.I have noticed that when then battery is at 9 hours of charge remaing, or less, it does not always connect easily.4-25-13 I washed my iPhone 4,oops, so I replaced it with an iPhone 4s. It pairs works with out a problem.
4	1322524800	So far, so good!  The sound quality is good and the few operations I've attempted have worked great.  It was easy to pair to my iPhone.  So far I've been able to answer the phone in my car, hands free, by just saying "answer".  I've been able to easily place calls by touching the "voice" button, saying "phone commands", then "call {person's name}". There's other things it will do, but I wanted it for the hands free capability and it works as advertised.
5	1322179200	Works fantastic except for the fm module which really isn't necessary anyways. Loud and clear, I almost always have to turn the volume down
1	1321920000	This product would not work unless I subscribed to it's $50 voice service. If someone knows a way to get it to work without it I am open to hearing about it and possibly changing my review.
5	1321228800	It works great and is small, the description picture makes you believe is a large item but it is not, it takes about a third of my visor. Battery seems to last for a long time but just in case I charge it once in a while or just check the batteries using the voice command. The voice of others sound clear and it can play loud, regarding how others hear me, I have not had any complaints, I'm happy with the product.
4	1321228800	I got the Freeway along with my iPhone 4S. It connected easily, and reconnects every time I get into my car. I sit down, and by the time I turn the ignition, it's reconnected (and lets you know by saying so). It works great as a speakerphone, callers sound good and I sound good to them. The volume goes up pretty high so you can still hear fine if you have a loud car. If you press and hold the big phone button for about 2 seconds, Siri will activate if you have it on your iPhone. Siri will use the Freeway's mic and speaker to talk to you. It's great to just press the button overhead and be able to have all of Siri's functions. If you're listening to music while you activate Siri, the music will fade out, and when you're done with it, the music fades back in.Playing music is fairly mediocre through the speaker. While I didn't expect amazing sound out of the tiny package, it's hardly the amazing surround sound that Jabra advertises. Most songs are going to sound fine, but if you have anything with heavy bass, it gets pretty distorted. It's good enough to listen to music on my commute, and more than enough to listen to podcasts with.The battery life is great, I seem to be getting the full 14 hours. Playing music counts as talk time, and when you check the battery status, the Freeway gives it to you in terms of talk time left. So if you have a full charge and drive a half hour with music, it'll tell you that you have 13 1/2 hours of talk time left. Since it shuts off soon after you get out of your car, it's not draining battery while idle.As a side note, the unit won't shut up if you flip your visor down. I've never had it shut off on me while I had the visor flipped down facing both the windshield and the side window. You just have to be careful not to mash buttons when you're gripping the visor.Overall it's good as a speakerphone, extension of Siri, and voice-only audio such as podcasts. Music could sound better, but I understand there's only so much you can get out of a tiny speaker. I haven't used any other Bluetooth speakerphones to compare this to, but I'm pretty happy with it.
5	1321142400	Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone (Black, Retail Packaging)I held onto my permanent mount, hands free phone in my vehicle to the very end. Finally had to make the switch to a hand held phone. Didn't like making or receiving calls on it while driving. Went to Amazon.com and searched for hands free devices. Bought the Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone. Great price, great device, totally hands free. Voice activated, make and receive calls by simply speaking to it. Works great, love it.milo57
5	1320796800	I've been using the Jabra Freeway for a while, and it works great.The volume and clarity of the calls is impeccable.One downside however is that the the Jabra voice that speaks to you is very loud. It'd be great if there were a way to adjust it.When getting into the car it says "Power on... connected" and the kids would always sigh. So if that could be turned down somehow, it'd be great to know how but still keep the call volume up.We've played music via bluetooth from the phone to the Jabra and then broadcasted that via the FM Radio feature, and that works pretty well. There's a little bit of static, but it's not too bad.The battery life is pretty good. If you're playing music through it, you'll wear it down fast however.One challenge is that if you go get something in the car in the garage and your phone is nearby, it'll auto-connect to the Jabra.It's happened a couple times where I'm on the phone inside the house and my wife gets in the car to go somewhere, and all of a sudden, my call is routed through the Jabra even though I'm not in the car. So watch out for that.Running bluetooth all the time on my phone seemed to be okay and hasn't affected the battery too bad, it just becomes a little annoying when it connects to the car when you're in the house (say like if someone gets something out of the car, shutting the door turns it on and makes it connect).One cool feature is that you can use voice commands through the Jabra to your phone, although when using it to call a contact, and you say the contact's name, it's had trouble pulling up the right contact or communicating the right action.Other than that, it's been great.
5	1320796800	My wife and I just got these and they are great! So easy to hear that we had to turn it down! And you can speak normally and be heard clearly. Really great product!
2	1320796800	Could be my phone (Samsung Fascinate), but the Freeway did not function as expected. The sound quality of calls was good but placing a call was a challenge. It uses the phone's address book and voice commands to place calls, unlike some of the other models that transfer your address book into the speakerphone. When placing a call by pressing the call button the initial prompts are loud and clear, but once it connects to the phone it was often completely inaudible, even though the phones volume was turned up all the way. I could hear a faint tick so I knew it was prompting me but couldn't be sure who I was calling. On occasion I could hear the phone prompts but it rarely understood my commands. I tried this from a parked vehicle with no ambient noise.The FM broadcasting was really a joke. I live in a fairly remote area with plenty of open channels but I couldn't get it to sound acceptable on any of them. I could barely hear it at all and reception had a lot of static.I sent it back. I plan on trying another Jabra model, one that loads the address book into the speakerphone. Hopefully it works better. I see lots of favorable reviews out there for this model so maybe I got a lemon or there's something wrong with my phone. I tried calling customer support before sending it back but couldn't get a hold of anyone (it was the weekend, so that's understandable, but it's not always convenient to call them during normal hours).
2	1320710400	The Freeway is advertised as having certain automatic features that it simply does not have. Specifically, Jabra makes the promise that as soon as you exit your vehicle, the device will turn off. This is simply not true. Instead, you must go a certain distance from your Freeway, enough for the Bluetooth signal to naturally lose strength and die, approximately 10 metres, or 30 feet.This actual behaviour is in stark contrast to how Jabra portrays the device's behaviour in its advertising.For example, in the video on the Jabra web site [..] at the 1:57 mark, the following text is displayed: "Turns off automatically when you leave the car." And demonstrated within the video, the Freeway headset turns itself off immediately after the woman closes the car door, while she's clearly still within a 10 metre range of the car and the Freeway unit.Additionally, in the "Virtual Tour" on your web site [..], and above here on the Amazon page, on the slide titled, "Turns itself on and off automatically" in the section, "Easy Control", it states: "When you leave the car it will automatically turn off."Furthermore, on the introductory web page for the device [..], and on this Amazon page, it reads: "It automatically turns on when you get into your car and off when you get out."The truth is, it doesn't turn off when you exit your vehicle.Nowhere on either the Jabra or Amazon web site is there a mention of a 10 metre range that you must exit to have the device turn actually turn itself off. According to the advertising and promotional materials, all you have to do it exit your vehicle. And that's simply not true at all; it's a misrepresentation of how the device truly behaves.Why is this a problem? If you live or work within that 10 metre range of your vehicle, as I do, the Freeway device will effectively never release the connection with your phone unless you manually break that connection. There are many other situations when this might be true, too. For example, if you park on the street and enter a nearby business or restaurant, the Freeway will retain the connection with your phone. This results in lost calls or, when you do happen to catch a call, confused calls. Even if you do manage to receive an inbound call on your phone, the audio will still be directed to the Freeway device that is locked in your car 10 metres away.A second inconvenience is battery life. Since the Freeway units remains permanently connected to your phone, the battery will generally die every day or two as it's generally never shifting into power saving mode.Personally, I'm thoroughly dissatisfied with the unit because it does not operate as advertised. I contacted Jabra's tech support about the matter and they suggested I manually turn the device on and off every time I enter and exit my vehicle. This is a ludicrous suggestion considering the automated on/off feature is so prominent in the company's marketing and promotional materials for the Freeway.If you live and/or work within close range of your vehicle, this car phone will cause significant grief and frustration as you fight it to release your phone its Bluetooth death grip, and I would not advise purchasing it.
5	1320624000	This is an excellent device for phone communication and for listening to music. Although it battery powered it connects automatically to the telephone when you bring it into the car, announcing that it has done so. It has some weaknesses and work arounds, some not listed in the guide. The main weakness is that its speech recognition is relatively weak. Particularly the BATTERY command. However, although not mentioned in the guide, if you press and hold the VOICE button it has the same effect of giving the charge status. Mentioned in the guide is the fact that you can press the answer/end button and hold it, it has the same effect of the command Phone Command when pressing once the VOICE button. I have mentioned the guide, but it is unusable unless you can enlarge it. I did so using my printer. The quality of the sound is excellent , although I use it primarily for listening to books, and have not felt the need to use the FM connection to the radio.I have used the Plantronics k100 and this device is far and above a better choice. I have also used the wired in car Motorola devices and I am more satisfied with this one. The charge time is excellent and a charger is included for the car in case you start to run low, which is announced.
4	1320364800	Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone (Black, Retail Packaging). Voice recognition is so so. Connects easily to iPhone 4, volume is easily adjustable and works well with windows up or down. Sound quality is good.
4	1320278400	I specifically purchased the Jabra FREEWAY for use as a speakerphone in my home office, not in a car. I don't have a landline phone and I only use my cell phone, so I wanted something that I could leverage as a speakerphone via bluetooth. So if you're basing your purchase on how well it works in a car, or how the voice dialing features work, please don't consider my review.The fact that I can make calls and play music over the FREEWAY was a plus in my purchase decision. In this regard, it works very well. The bluetooth pairing with my iPhone 4S was incredibly easy and iOS does a great job of allowing you to control the audio source. Sound quality is very good. The speakers produce very clear audio and music (very little base with music). The downsides are that the FREEWAY is loud and doesn't cancel-out echo caused by working in a small office. Even at the lowest volume setting, it's loud. If you work in a shared office or public area, it may be too loud.Battery life is extremely good. I've charged it once and I've been using it for days. The device will power itself off if it's not used for a period of time, even if it's currently paired with a device.  It uses a micro-USB charger and comes with a USB cable and car-charger.  So, if you use this in your office you can plug this into your laptop and let it charge.A speakerphone on my desk with no cables attached is extremely nice.  The device is so small I can store it away in my desk when not in use. I could even fit it in my laptop bag if I wanted to travel with it. So I would recommend this for people looking for something similar.  Good product.
5	1320192000	The Jabr Freeway BlueTooth Speakerphone/Speaker is a fantastic product. I spent about 2 weeeks researching various bluetooth speakerphone/speaker for my iphone and I was very surprised how few products were designed for this important niche market. I found products that ranged from about $50 to around $200. There are some highend units that are over $500 but these products were for serious audiophiles.The Jabr Freeway is the most recent version and it really is an incredible product. It is lightweight, very compact (smaller then my iphone) and it is very easy to use. When I use it as a speakerphone, the clarity of the voices on both sides of the call is excellent. Jabr put in two microphones and 3 speakers to provide high quality sound. It is very easy to attach to my visor and does not impede my driving view. When I am listening to music and a call comes in the Jabr announces the call, gives me an option to verbally accept or decline the call. If I accept, the music goes off and the call is answered; if I reject a call, the call is terminated and the music continues.The product is so versatile, compact and lightweight that I know go for a walk with my iphone playing music through the Jabr and enjoy not wearing a headset.At less than $100, this is a great product.Enjoy
5	1320105600	I just received this product and I couldn't be more thrilled.  The set-up was the easiest ever and I love that the unit connects to your phone when you enter the car and disconnects when you exit.  When I first heard the voice say "connected" I was hooked.I have experienced an issue when I'm not far away from my car and the unit is still connected.  But that's a simple solution - just deactivate the bluetooth on my phone; it will automatically reconnect when I enter the car again.I've read the previous reviews and I now know how to use the Voice Assist software.  I really couldn't be more happy with my purchase!
4	1319241600	The Jabra is very easy to set-up and use.  It's voice commands are limited, but when used the voice assist option, is an excellent device.  It does have some trouble understanding what you're saying sometimes, which becomes frustrating.  I'm not sure if this is due to sup-par phone coverage or not.  When it works tho', it is an absolutely slick, fabulous, fun and handy gadget.
5	1319068800	First and foremost, my prior Bluetooth hands free device was a built-in Parrot which I sold with my last truck. After owning and using a built-in Bluetooth hands free device I'm astonished by the quality of the Jabra FREEWAY! This isn't a comparison, I'm just amazed at the fact that I no longer need a built-in Bluetooth device.About my experience with the FREEWAY, as aforementioned it's like having a built-in hands free device. Such as, the call quality is great, answering calls is a breeze, battery life lasts for days and using the vehicles speakers via the FREEWAY's built-in FM transmitter is nice for listening to your music, podcasts or streaming talk shows from your Smartphone to any vehicle. What's more, I take the FREEWAY with me and set it on my desk and have a high quality speakerphone that I can also stream music and etc, to. The FREEWAY has been the perfect replacement for my Parrot even surpassing the abilities of the built-in device. I've even thought about taking it for a run, but thankfully I have a Jabra SPORT for running. What can I say, Jabra has done an amazing job with their latest Bluetooth devices from the actual voice on each device (female by the way) to the build quality.Don't hesitate, it's great,Chris
3	1318809600	This is my first review, so I may miss somethings.  If you want to get rid of the annoying ear piece and avoid getting a traffic citation this thing is great.When you get a call all you have to do is say "Answer" and you are connected, both sides can hear the conversation clearly.  In fulfilling this primary function, The FREEWAY is a 5 star device.The voice recognition is far from perfect.  Your Voice Assist contacts have to be filled out completely or it will not find them.  I have been able to make a few voice dialed calls, but more often than not I get a really angry cell phone customer who is not one of my contacts and who hates me to waste her minutes.  I feel bad about that, so I don't use that feature anymore.If all I wanted was a basic speakerphone, I could have purchased a less expensive one.
5	1318377600	This is a review for Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth SpeakerphoneI'm not one to take my time to write reviews, but after purchasing three of these speakerphones I thought maybe it would be helpful to tell you why this is the best speakerphone I have ever used.We live in California and, by law, have to have our Cell Phones connected by Bluetooth if we use them in the car.  I have probably used 4-5 different brands and configurations in the past 5 years - all with mixed results, until I came across the Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone.  I really dislike using in-ear Bluetooth devices (for many reasons, but mainly because they interfere with hearing and make you look like a  . . . . ).  Speakerphones I have used in the past (including the less expensive Jabra products) seemed to never clearly pick-up my voice and transmit it to the caller.  When I purchased my first Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone (after reading a glowing CNET Review) I started using it as soon as I charged it for a couple of hours.  It is the easiest, most user friendly product I have bought in a long time.Getting up and running requires:1.  Charge unit (USB)2.  Turn on Cell Phone and put in pairing mode3.  Turn on Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone - it will find the phone and announce "Connected"4.  That's it, your done.Now to use it you only have to do one thing and remember 2 words:1.  Attach the Speakerphone to your visor and turn it on.2.  Remember 2 words when it announces by name an incoming call.  a) Answer (connects you to an incoming call) or b) Cancel (phone goes straight to you voice answer message).It really is that easy.  There is a lot more that the Speakerphone will do, and there is a one year subscription to a second party company that keeps all your contacts + more so you can call one number and transfer to anyone in your contacts, send text, etc.  But you really don't need to know or use any of that.Oh, I forgot, the main reason I like the Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone is that my clients have no clue that I am even on a Bluetooth device when I talk to them in the car.  No extraneous noise, no wind noise, just a clear voice.  That, plus the ease of use is why I keep buying more of these and giving them to my wife, children, etc.Did I mention that once you turn the Jabra Freeway on you don't have to touch/recharge it for a month or more (my experience, moderate use).  It turns itself on when I get in the car, and turns itself off when I exit (motion detector).Pros:  All of the above.  Plus, iTune music sounds pretty good through the 3 speakers and podcasts are great (you can also transmit the music/podcast to you FM radio) - the Speakerphone "knows" to to stop the music/podcast if a call comes in.Cons:  It takes a couple of minutes for the speakerphone to turn-off automatically when you you leave the car. For a short time, if you are fairly close to the car (in you home or office) the unit still picks-up calls.  This has happened to me only once, and my iPhone asks if I want to not use the Bluetooth on the screen, so it really is a minor annoyance.
4	1318291200	I really like this hands free and the only issue I have found is related to the voice recognition feature for Voice Assist. One would think that saying the "Voice Assist" command would be easily recognized, but I find myself having to repeat it several times and ended up using my phone address book instead. Hopefully this will work with the new iPhone 4S and I can use the voice recognition  on it to make calls.Otherwise, those who I asked said that they did not know I was on a speaker and the sound quality was excellent.
5	1318204800	The Jabra Freeway is just what it claimed to be, the top of the line mobile link to my iPhone. It has a very long standby time on the battery, the sound quality is remarkable and the automation of linking with the phone when the phone and the Freeway are in range of each other is outstanding. The only negative that I had was the sensitivity of the various "buttons" like "phone", "FM" etc. made the device problematic for use as something I could carry around with me (it wasn't made for that in the first place). A switch to disable those "buttons" would make the device perfect for my personal use.
4	1318032000	+Good sound quality+good battery life-no so good voice recognition. Actually I can't use it. Doesn't recognize much of what I'm saying
5	1316995200	I love this thing. I have tried a few of these Bluetooth speakerphones and all of them have been weak when it comes to sound quality and, more importantly, volume. I often have to turn this thing down because it is so loud. It automatically connects to my iPhone 3GS as soon as I sit in the car...and connects to my wife's iPhone 4 when she is in the car...at the same time. High marks for this one Jabra!
3	1316476800	I really loved the clear sounds from this product and that it didn't drop calls like the standard blue tooth head piece.There were a couple of things I didn't like though. If you're going to charge in your car, the way the cord is plugged in would leave the cord hanging in front of your face. So I usually recharged only at home. The second problem is that there is no indicator on how much battery life there is left on the device. Through the menu, you can try and say "battery" to check the status, but we had problems communicating w/ the device. We had 5 different people test that feature and we only were able to check the battery life maybe 1/15 attempts, and we all spoke clear English as well. So you can't figure out the battery status even if it's fully charged.Other than the question of the verbal menu and the battery status, the product was easy to synch up and use. In addition, it was clear on both ends of the call.
4	1316304000	At first my Droid would pair but not connect to the Jabra. Then I reset the Jabra, turned off my phone, and started the process over. That worked! Now it connects when ever I enter my truck. I don't like the FM transmitter. Living in San Diego, there are not that many "empty" stations with weak frequencies. And the volume is quite lower than the speakerphone. So I don't use it. Voice Assist is interesting. It's actually a phone number you call to use its features. Overall, it's a nice product.
5	1316131200	For me, the only thing that truly mattered to me was the clarity of the call.  I have had all sorts of expensive headsets, and I've nearly always had the pure frustration of not being able to hear the person on the other end.  I could write a long review, but other people already have.  I just need to say that having used this for a month, I have not experienced a single instance where the call clarity was problematic.  In fact, it is clearer than using my phone directly.  I should also add that It took 3 weeks before I had to charge it.  That's with standby and plenty of talk time.
2	1315785600	My biggest problem is the FM transmission aspect is not as good as that on my Jabra Cruiser. I'm very disappointed that at the cost of this unit it's a step back in what for me is one of the most important features.
3	1315526400	Jabra nailed it with this product...the long battery life, the motion detector that notices when you return to your vehicle (and when you have left it for a while) so it can go onto standby mode, etc.  The call quality is clear.Unfortunately, the internal speaker is W-A-Y to loud for comfort...especially considering it sits about 6 inches from your head.  The FM transmitter I haven't found to be very great (static on FM channels) so I can't bypass the loud internal speaker unfortunately.Overall I am happy with the product but it seems such a simple fix to allow the speaker volume to get lowered - perhaps a firmware update, although the website does not have any indication of past or future updates.
5	1315353600	I absolutely adore the Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone. Sure...- it works fine as a hands free speaker phone- easily clips to a visor- has fantastic battery life- can be paired with 2 devices at a timeetc.All of that good stuff is in the specs and in other buyers' reviews but what really impressed me and why this has to be one of the top speakerphone products I've ever listened to is the sound quality. I use it more in the house and when travelling than in the car! For listening to music at low and medium volumes (from my iPhone and iPad) it's replaced my dock and my external iPhone/iPad speakers. It's great for boosting the audio when the kids watch movies. The sound is rich, deep and surprisingly balanced. Highly recommended!
4	1314835200	This visor-mounted speakerphone is an excellent device to replace your annoying earpiece headset.  Very long battery life, with verbal "low-battery" warning.  Strong speakers.  Good microphone pickup.  Interesting ability to transmit on FM station(s), so that all audio comes from your car's radio, rather than the device's speaker, although this feature often has interference in urban areas with many radio stations.  Overall: Good product, and good value.
2	1314748800	Did not work as expected. Had to pair the device every single time. So returned the product after trying it for a week
5	1314489600	I've been using the Jabra freeway for about a month now. I recommend it for the excellent sound quality of both speakers and mic.Worth the 129$ I spent on it.
5	1314316800	I've owned many Jabra's: the SP700, Cruiser, Cruiser2 and now the Freeway.  This is by far the best built and sounding of all the units yet.My main reason for upgrading was the inclusion of the Auto On/Off feature.  I always found that the power switches were way too small and I never was far enough away from my car for the bluetooth to disconnect; this was very annoying.I've read that some people are having issues with the Freeway NOT turning off, but there's a reason for that and you need to understand how it works.First off, the Motion Sensor in the Freeway is not the type of motion sensor is Sensor lights, etc., it's a vibration sensor.When the power switch is in the ON position and the unit is asleep, opening the car door (or even shaking the car) will cause the unit to power on.Unlike in the product video on the Jabra site, the Freeway does NOT turn off immediately when you exit your car.  Instead, if there is no movement or sound activity for ~5+ minutes, the Freeway will turn OFF.  ANY movement or sound through its speakers will reset the 5 minute count all over again.Here's the problem some people will have with this: If you have a phone that makes noises when you use it, such as clicks when typing on the iPhone keyboard or locking the phone, these noises are sent to the Freeway if you are still connected to it and keep resetting the power-off timer - it will never power down if you are using your phone frequently!At least on the iPhone, the quick way around this is to set the "iPhone" as the current playback device when you exit your car every time:  Simply double-click the home button to bring up the Active Apps Bar, then swipe Right until you see the Volume Slider.  If you are currently connected to the Jabra, you will also see a selector button to the Right of the volume slider.  Tap the button and deselect the Freeway by tapping the "iPhone" selection.  Now, all your clicks and noises are sent to the iPhone's speaker; the Jabra will power itself off in 5 minutes or so.
5	1314316800	I use it everyday since May. And every day I feel very happy to have it.I almost never pull my phone (Nexus One) out the pocket in the car, because I can manage it by the voice.When I sit in the car, Jabra automatically establish connection with the phone and says "connected".When I leave the car, it automatically disconnects.For example, I used T505 MOTOROKR before, and with it, when you sit in the car you have to power it ON manually.
4	1313798400	Works great. I love it! Just turn it on and relax, the sound is clear and very easy to pare.
4	1313625600	So far the quality of this device is good.  It was super easy to setup.  I have not tried the voice commands for contact dialing so not sure about that yet.
5	1313107200	I have purchased 3 different bluetooth automobile speaker phones.  This is by far and away the best.  The volume makes it easy to hear over traffic noise even with the windows open. Very easy to set up and voice dialing works very well too.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering a similar product.
4	1312416000	Overall I am very pleased with the Freeway.  I use it in my cargo van which is real noisy.  It doesn't always get my voice commands perfect as a result but in a normal vehicle or if I am not driving 70 miles an hour down the freeway it works great.  I use it all the time as I am on the road a great deal.  Glad I found it and would definitely buy it again.
5	1312329600	The Freeway is a great way to to use your phone "hands free". The voice Assist feature lets you make calls, send emails and texts verbally without taking your hands off the wheel. A great tool.
5	1312156800	We have another manufacturers bluetooth speakerphone ( search my review to find it if your curious). This unit here performs so much better. It seems that Jabra has bluetooth nailed down. With this unit it is very easy to set up. Once paired it intuitively works with any phone paired with it. Driving is SO much easier when you have a handsfree unit mounted above your head.Pros:+ Easy to pair with phone+ Nice volume+ Great sound quality+ Easy to communicate with when mounted on visorCons:- Battery life is soso, just keep it plugged in when not in driving.Overall this is a very good hands-free unit to use while driving. I find I can concentrate on the task at hand and not be fiddling around with the phone. A must get for anyone concerned with driving safely, and a great gift for your easily distracted teen driver.Thank you for reading my review.
5	1312156800	This little device is designed well.  The sound is very loud and clear if you have it attached to the visor in the car, although I'm not a fan of the wire clip, which can be a bit harsh on the visor itself.  I suppose that's the only way to make sure that it will stay put.  The built in wire clip is fairly tight and needs a bit of strength to open.  The functions all work as advertised, however, one drawback I found is that your can't really use the FM transmitter when you have the power cord attached.  For some reason, it interferes with the transmission.  The other drawback about the FM transmitter is that it can only search up but not down radio stations for a blank channel.The sound from the speaker is tinny while in the car.  As the speaker is flat and lacks volume, it's not a surprise that the sound lacks bass.  It sounds much better when you use it indoors as a speakerphone because you can hear more bass response.  Since the main function of this speakerphone is for voice I guess it's designed to do exactly that: transmit human voice, which is focused in the mid frequencies.Pairing it was a breeze and the automatic sensor to turn on the speakerphone when you enter your car works also as advertised.  Voice command is hit or miss. Sometimes it's a pain as it's inaccurate in executing commands but when it works it's great.I don't necessarily like the fact I always have to reach up to the visor to hit buttons every time I need to make a call or do something with the unit.  It's dangerous to be distracted that way.The sound heard on the receiving end of the speakerphone is so-so.  At least that's what I've ben told by those who had conversations with me on the road.  It does block out some road noise but the sound is unmistakably a car speakerphone so don't expect miracles.I find myself using this more at home as a speakerphone than in the car.  There is a mini USB port for charging as well as firmware updates.  There's also an on/off button that will announce in a female voice that it's on or off when using this button.Lastly, is this unit worth its price?  It's hard to say but I suppose it's worth it if you spend a lot of time talking in your car.  I can't see myself buying it otherwise and would chose a cheaper alternative if I only occasionally needed to have a phone conversation in my car.
5	1311811200	Purchased it for my husband as a gift.  With all the new laws about "hands free phone use" along with all the driving he does in his work, this was the ultimate " office assistant"!!  He loves it!Jabra FREEWAY Bluetooth Speakerphone (Black, Retail Packaging)
5	1311552000	I waited for two months for the release of the Jabra Freeway., it seemed to have every option I was looking for and more.I must say I'm very happy with my Jabra.I had initially given this a poor rating, but since I've been using it, I really like the FM capabilities.It has very low volume if I don't use it that way, and try using it through the Jabra speaker only.I'm perfectly happy using it through my car speakers.I really love my Jabra!
5	1311120000	My car does not have integrated bluetooth, and having had it before, I really missed it.  THIS is the answer I have been looking for.  It is incredibly simple to hook up and start using.  The sound quality on both my end and the other person's end is great.There are so many areas that are now requiring a hands free set up if you are going to use the phone in your car, you should strongly consider getting ahead of the curve and buying this speakerphone.For those concerned about installation and pairing, the instructions are very clear and concise.  You will have no trouble whatsoever, regardless of your technical levels.  Do not hesistate to make this purchase, you will love it!
5	1311120000	Bought a new car with the hands free Bluetooth option. What a piece of junk!  Phone wouldn't automatically connect and the sound quality was awful. Picked this up as a replacement and am very happy. It has great sound and folks on the other end of the line often cannot tell I'm on hands free. Definitely a winner!
3	1311033600	This is the perfect addition to any car that doesn't have built in bluetooth.  It works great as a stand alone speaker microphone, but it would not play through the radio in my 2006 Honda Ridgeline or my friends 2010 VW Jetta.  The lack of this feature doesn't hinder the operation of the speakerphone, but the fact that it wouldn't work in either vehicle suggests that Jabra knows this is a glitch but markets the device as having this feature anyway.  If it had worked through the radio I would have given it 4 stars.
2	1310601600	A few weeks ago I tried to research all the available speakerphones looking especially for ease of use. My plan was to use it for a few weeks and if I liked it I was going to buy one for each of my family members. I was not concerned about price so much as function. Right before I was ready to pull the trigger i came across the Jabra Freeway. Maybe I didn't see it before becauae it was new? It looked quite impressive. Out of the box it had a quality look and feel. Set up is fairly straight forward with voice prompts pretty much taking you through each step. The was sound quality is surprisingly good. Problems: The unit did not understand my voice commands. I had to repeat myself OFTEN. The buttons were not very intuitive and I found myself looking up at the unit to find what to button push which defeated part of the reason (safety) for purchasing the unit. But the biggest problem was having the unit "re-pair" when re-entering the vehicle. I found myself having to turn the unit off and re-pairing every time. I went to the Jabra site for troubleshooting and even downloaded an available update hoping to fix it. Bottom line is that I returned it. Very disappointed. I I think I may have bought a lemon but I'm not willing to take the chance. So the search goes on for the perfect speakerphone.BTW, the Amazon return process was seamless, easy, and prompt with good communication.
1	1310601600	The good:Excellent clarity and ergonomics, paring with 2 phones was easy,The bad:Unreliable.  Here were my issues:- When a call came in, saying "Answer" resulted in the call being picked up, but I couldn't hear anyone and they couldn't hear me.- When trying to make a call, saying "Phone Commands" many times resulted in the unit replying back with the remaining battery life.- The FM transmitter function did not work.- Skipping the voice commands and using the buttons what also hit and miss.  Sometimes pressing the Answer/End button did nothing.  (and yes, I know the difference between a `tap' and a `press')I also tried upgrading the firmware from the website (which worked well), but that did not solve any issues.Bottom line, when you are driving, you need something that works all the time, without having to take your eyes off the road.  I found myself pulling over several times try to get this thing to work!I tried two different phones with this unit and had similar results, a Samsung Intensity and a Samsung Convoy.  My wife and I both tried the voice commands with limited success.  Both my wife and I speak native English.  So the issues can't be related to a specific phone model or to phonetics.Maybe I got a defective unit, maybe not, but for the price I paid, I didn't want to take a chance on another one.  I returned the Jabra Freeway to Amazon.  (Amazon is fantastic to deal with regarding returns).
4	1310515200	I've been using this for a month and have been happy so far. I haven't bothered to activate the voice activated dialing feature as it's easy enough to quickly pick-up or make a call using the handset. Sound is loud and clear. The FM Transmitter is not that great but I have yet to find one that works well and will be hooking up an AUX jack to my older car stereo anyway to take care of that.Only reason I'm giving it four instead of five is that, as others have said, even the lowest volume setting is a bit too loud for me.The gem of this though is the cigarette lighter &lt;> USB charger that comes with the unit. A cable comes with it so you can charge your Jabra but the adapter lets you plug in any USB cable so you can use it charge your phone, iPad, or any other unit that can charge via USB. Very useful!
5	1310342400	Jabra I stand up and give you a standing ovation for the Jabra Freeway Speakerphone.  I previously was using theJabra CRUISER2 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphonebut sadly had to give it up to my dear husband who refused to use a headset.  I did not mind because this way I was able to acquire the newer model.  The Jabra Freeway is the newest model since the Cruiser 2.  It is a tad bit larger, but offers a few more features such as automatic turn on and off with the built-in motion sensor, and acoustically optimized HD quality microphones and surround sound speakers.  You pretty much give all the commands by your voice.  For example when you call comes in, you can just say "answer" or "ignore".  If you want to make a call, just hit the "Voice" button once and say "phone commands", then say "call &lt;John Doe> mobile".  It is that easy.  That is one big difference between the Cruiser 2 and the Freeway.  With the Cruiser 2 you had to hold and count the seconds on the action button to make it do certain commands such as last redial or voice dial.  With the Freeway everything is done with the touch of one button and I don't have to hold it for 1, 2 or 3 seconds!I got so excited about talking about the actual usage of the speakerphone that I almost forgot to mention the setup.  I am using it with the Verizon iPhone 4G and setup with so simple it took less than one minute.  The automated programmed voice is very clear to hear and understand.  This is the first time I have had to actually turn the volume down on a speakerphone because it was too loud! The sound is crystal clear.  I really do not know how anyone can give this item a bad review unless it does not work with their particular brand of phone.  in regards to the FM transmitter functions, it works as well as other types of transmitters I have tried.  There is NO wireless FM transmitter out there that is not going to be static free.  Think about, the only way is be able to be static free is to be directly plugged into your radio and not be "wirelessly".  This speakerphone will be primarily used for phone calls and not for my the FM transmitter.  I can hear perfectly loud and clear by the units speakers and have no need to be using it to play my iTunes music through it.  the speakers alone will be sufficient for me to hear my calls loud and clearly.Now lets get to the Voice Assist.  Forget about it.  Not worth it.  I did sign up for it since it is a free trial offer for one-year but I don't see any use for it.  I asked myself do I really need to urgently send someone a text message or post a status on Facebook?  Is it that important that I can't wait till I am out of the car and on my computer, iPad or iPhone.  I can wait - I am not that important to be posting about my life's every moment for all to know.  Also, what most might not realize is that you have to call a landline phone number that uses airtime off your cellular plan in order to use the Voice Assist.  Signing up was not as much of a hassle as some made it sound.  Just make sure to read the instructions on the Voice Assist website and you should have no problems.  You have to download the firmware upload and apply it, THEN enter your UPC code after the firmware update is applied.  This is for units purchased from Amazon ONLY.YOU WILL LOVE THIS SPEAKERPHONE.  I am curious to see what is next for Jabra since I can not imagine how something so perfect could be improved.  Well now that I think about it, maybe they will come up with "Park Assist" on their next units.  :-)EDIT:  I almost forgot to add one more thing.  This comes with a really nice long micro USB cord.  Not one of those "bungee" ones either.  It is straight and long enough to fit plugged into a 12V that is inside my center console glovebox while charging the speakerphone still clipped to my sunvisor (while parked of course).
4	1310256000	I've tried them all BlueAnt,Jawbone,Plantronics,Motorola so far the Freeway is the best thing Ive used to date even compared to Built-in car systems. To be fair the default Jabra voice control apps are totally mediocre and avg at best, however when you drop $100+ to buy this you get 1yr prepaid of VoiceAssist service, that alone makes it worth while nice partnership Jabra. :-  Sound Quality is great really does sound rich and full like surround sound, not as good as a full car stereo but cant complain, battery life is decent wish it lasted a week, I love playing music files from my phone through the device and with the Voice Assist service I can send and receive Facebook updates,txts,email all by voice without looking at or touching my phone. Who knows how many lives Ive saved including my own lol!  Biggest negative I can think of is the visor mount, it's not convenient if you need to pull your visor down to block the sun, wish it had a simple plastic folding clip that would let you rotate the freeway instead of having to remove it when you flip visor down Overall nice piece of technology!
4	1310256000	I purchased this Jabra Freeway about 1 month ago from Amazon.com.  I made this purchase decision after conducting extensive research and looking at a variety of other bluetooth devices.  Overall, I'm pleased to report that it works great, and I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars.Here's what I like:The device looks very sleek, hi-tech, and blends in well with my car.  it fits snug against the visor, very secure.  The set-up was really easy.  It also is very easy to use.  I have a Blackberry torch and it syncs easily with it.  Push the "voice" button and it says "Say a command".  Then you have to say "Phone Command", and then it says "Say a Command" through my cell phone.  Then, I say something like "Call home" or "call office" and it dials it.  My biggest gripe with other bluetooth devices has been the voice quality, both on my end hearing the other person, as well as the other person complaining about hearing me, either because of the "bathroom echoing" sound or because they can't hear me at all.  Well, I've used this numerous times, and I always ask the person how I sound.  Every one of them have said that it's crystal clear with no echoing or any other problems.  In fact, they have told me that it sounds like I'm talking on a hardline, not even a cell phone and certainly not on a speakerphone from my car!  That's what I call high sound quality!  And I hear them crystal clear as well.  Battery life is 14 hours per charge, and I had to charge it for the first time after 1 month of moderate use.What I don't like:I wish that I could just push the Voice button and say "Call home" without going through the extra steps of saying "Phone Command".  Also, when someone calls me, my cell phone rings like 3 or 4 times before they announce the caller's name and before I can say "answer."  Most of the time the voice command works, but it's not 100% accurate.  Wish Jabra could improve on that.  But overall, I'd highly recommend this device.
4	1310083200	I have used a few bluetooth headsets and speakerphones. This is by far the best. It is very convenient, can ear well, work very well as a speaker which changed my in-car behavior a lot. Only downside is the unnecessary voice activation. Since it is not controlling my phone itself and i had to call their additional service number after I upload my contacts from gmail, I decided not to use the service though I have 1 year free subscription. Also, voice recognition of this device or my iPhone4(or both) is not good enough to use it when driving. Again, the strength og this device, being very good at basic functions, made me feel it was a good decision.
3	1309996800	The Jabra Freeway came out of the box ready for use. It paired easily with my iPhone4. My single complaint is that the minimum volume is too loud. The speakers are not of enough quality to handle this sound and it comes out distorted. The Jabra, however, has a built in FM transmitter to allow conversations over your car radio.
5	1309824000	I purchased the Jabra Freeway on recommendation from a friend.  I have had it now for several weeks - it works as advertised.  I use it with an iphone 4.  It is easy to operate right out of the box.  Before you use it the first time the small instruction book asks you to match it to your phone.  As my phone was already bluetooth enabled, just seconds after I turned on the Jabra it announced this step was complete.  At this point you are ready to go.  You attach it to your visor.  To operate it you press a button on the unit - it then asks you to "say a command".  You can use voice commands to check the battery level, make a call using your phone's voice dial system, etc.  When you receive an incoming call you do not need to press a button.  It announces the incoming call and asks you what you want to do, i.e answer, ignore.  To disconnect a call you press a button on the unit. The volume is great.  Some reviewers have stated it is too loud but I do not believe this to be the case.  Mine came with a charged battery.  Each charge lasts a long time - many hours of talk time.  The battery charges fast.
4	1309824000	I had an earlier Jabra Model (two years old) and it was nearly useless in my relatively noisy cars.  The big reason I bought this thing was the promise of noise cancelling. It delivers.  The Freeway works in my convertible - top up only, but still...  I also like the automatic on/off feature.  Even though my phone is usually within the Bluetooth range, the Freeway turns off (thus releasing the phone) if the car sits undisturbed for some period I have not tried to figure out.  When I get back into the car (or someone else shakes it), it is a little disconcerting to have a disembodied voice say "connected," but you get used to it.Since my phone accepts voice commands, I haven't bothered to have the Freeway take over that function.  If I did, I would not like the fact that the "Voice Assist" feature is free for the first year only.  Then it appears to be $59.  Otherwise there is a somewhat limited set of voice commands, one of which is "phone commands" that gets me into the phone voice activation.Voice clarity of the unit is good on both ends (a lot better than the old one).  The FM output is good and playing the phone's music list works reasonably well.
3	1308787200	I have the older version of this, theJabra CRUISER2 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone, which I LOVE! So far I have not been impressed with this BIGGER version that does the same thing. From my end, this one sounds richer and clearer, but EVERYONE, and I mean everyone has been asking me to repeat everything, speak up, etc. I have tried repositioning this in my vehicle but without improvement in the sound quality being transmitted to my friends and family. The one thing I do like is the FM transmitter. I use it in my corvette, which does not have an aux input (yet) to transmit music from my ipod to this to my car stereos available fm channels. It's a nice function if you don't want to add an aux jack, upgrade your car stereo, or run wires from your iphone, ipod, or ipad. The volume buttons are easy to use and the visor clip helps it to attach securely. In my opinion, it's just way too big though. The older version was smaller and worked better.
4	1308614400	An interesting concept for those who don't want to be tethered by a headset in their car -- a high quality bluetooth speakerphone. While I try to avoid having a phone conversation in the car period (distraction), I give this device a passing grade for allowing me to do so without fumbling with a headset. However, consider that this costs two to three times more than a decent bluetooth headset.The device includes a micro-USB car/lighter charger -- however, I don't see you wanting to run this cable from your sun visor (where it is advised you install the device). No wall USB charger is included -- but you can use any standard USB power supply with the included standard micro-USB cable if you want to charge inside. There is a nice slider power on switch (that even announces when powered off) rather than many bluetooth headsets which have very user unfriendly ways of changing power state. Pairing with my iPhone 4 was a breeze with voice prompts telling me how to do so. My phone even shows me the battery status of the speakerphone in the phone's status bar.I tested first some stereo music from my iPhone since that was handy, and was pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. It's definitely better than what comes out of the iPhone, but not dedicated portable music speaker quality either -- consider this a bonus feature. Callers can hear me clearly, however, when I tell them I'm on a speakerphone, they aren't surprised as the quality is not quite up to snuff as using the handset or bluetooth headset. Incoming volume is also excellent and easy to adjust -- in fact, with slower driving, the lowest volume setting still seems to loud.I have no interested in the FM transmitter feature (which always works poorly for any device in large cities) -- my car has an AUX input that I would rather use, unfortunately, there's no way to get audio out of the device (but I of course can just plug my phone directly into my stereo.) Voice commands work OK, but I did find myself repeating myself too many times -- hooray for the big button that lets you answer and hang up phone calls and the logically placed volume controls. I wish buttons let you control more parts of the device, though I get the idea that it takes your eyes of the road. I did not try out Voice Assist -- again, for safety reasons, no interest in dictating to twitter while I am driving.If you know you don't want a headset for use in the car, this is probably one of the best alternatives out there. It also works well as just a desktop speakerphone outside of your car -- if you see the need for that type of device as well.
1	1308355200	I liked the idea of the hands free calling but it's not worth it for the listeners on the other end of the call. No clue if it's road noise but people on the other end of many calls said my voice was skipping out or they just had a hard time hearing my voice at all. I went and bought the cheaper unit at Costco and everyone raved at how well the unit sounded when I called them. So this one goes back to Amazon and I'll stick with the cheaper unit. Too bad cos it looks cool.
5	1308182400	My initial impressions after removing the Jabra Freeway from the box was that it was small/compact but had nice build quality.In terms of charging I noticed the included battery car charger had the same type of universal usb plug that my Android cellphone had so I used my home cellphone charger to successfully charge the Jabra.The bluetooth pairing with my cellphone was actually the easiest I have ever done - basically the voice commands walked me through the steps and I was paired.  I compare that experience to a few other bluetooth gadgets where I still can't even really pair to this day such as some bluetooth speakers that I have.In terms of actual usage I found the Jabra nice to use in my car.  Easy to use in synch with my cellphone.  My voice is very clear to people and I can hear them clearly.  The unit holds a good battery charge and easy to recharge with the included car charger.As a bonus, I even experimented with the additional functionality of using the Jabra as stereo speakers.  While at the local park picnic table I used my cellphone to stream Pandora music to the Jabra and it worked just fine.  Of course since the Jabra is small the sound quality is not that great but still much better than my cellphone speaker.One thing that came to my mind is how much longer the market for car standalone handsfree speakers will last.  Seems like most of the new cars have bluetooth cell link integrated as does one of my vehicles.  Reminds me of the old standalone gps units (before they became more integrated in cellphones and cars).So overall, I give this Jabra 5-stars.  Nice quality and works as advertised, better than other speakerphones I have tried in the past.  It is a bit pricey, but I guess better to pay a bit more and get a product that works well.
5	1308096000	When I got it I was surprised at how small this speaker was. I didn't really have a good idea of how small it actually was. I have attached a picture to the product page comparing it to my Droid X. I then charged the speaker up before using it. You get a USB cable and a cigarette lighter plug with a USB port to charge it in the car or on a PC. Once charged I turned it on I was shocked at how good it sounded given its diminutive size as it walked me through the pairing process. It paired with my phone very easily. Then I played some music to test it out. It not only sounds good given its size it also has quite a lot of volume to it. You can turn it up until it sounds distorted but it is already at a excessively loud volume by that point.You can press the voice button and say, "What can I say?" to the unit and it will tell you what your options are. My unit didn't say that I could say voice assist like all the directions indicated. This wasn't a big deal to me so I just set up the voice assist number as a contact in my phone. All the voice command was supposed to do was call the number to connect you to the service. A few days into things I got a call from Voice Assist telling me the factory shipped the wrong firmware on the device and they provided me with a link to update the firmware. Updating the firmware was easy and a non-issue. As far as the voice assist service goes I wasn't very impressed. It frequently misunderstood me and the few times I tried sending someone a txt using it the txt usually had a delay, one time it took 45 minutes to arrive. You aren't going to want unit for the voice assist service. Most of its functionality is done by my phone anyway, all I have to do is hit the voice button and say, "Phone Commands" and my phone will talk to me and listen using its built in software.Using the speaker in the car was great overall. I had no problems hearing people and was told that it sounds better than the speakerphone function of my Droid X. When the car isn't moving and it isn't being used the speaker will go to sleep. When you push a button or move the car it will wake up and reconnect to your phone. I also enjoy using the speaker inside as a speakerphone. It sounds much better than my phone's speaker.The only feature I wasn't impressed with was the FM transmitter. Music and voice weren't as clear or dynamic sounding as I would have thought and contained static no matter what frequency I tried. I am sure there are regulations as to how much power they can transmit but it just wasn't cutting it for me. I am sure there are many factors in play here from the stereo to antenna placement and someone else may have a different experience. This wouldn't really be a factor in my selection of the device though as it isn't a feature I require.Overall I am really impressed and if you are looking for a device like this I wouldn't hesitate to recommend one. I really like mine.
5	1308096000	Setup couldn't have been any easier with my iPhone 3GS. All automatic. Sound is excellent. Volume is more than adequate. Only drawback is the FM transmitter. If I was actually expecting to use that feature, then I would have given it 4 stars rather than 5. I think FM transmitters are a joke...they rarely work well.  The feature works very simply on the Freeway, but the entire concept of FM transmission is flawed. Feedback, static, loss of clarity.  It's all pretty bad.Back to the Freeway. I've experimented with my windows open, windows closed, driving on the freeway...it's all good. Very good quality sound at all levels.  Unbelievable battery life - like 14 hours or something.
5	1308096000	One of my pet peeves while driving (and I have quite a few) is people holding a phone up to their ear. Usually it's the left hand, which means they don't use their turn signal before cutting me off. It can't be a money thing because you can buy a bluetooth headset for fewer than twenty bucks. Even people driving cars that cost more then houses I've bought are holding the phone up to their head. It can't be because of the complexity of operation because a monkey could be trained to pair a wireless headset. I wonder how they would react in an emergency? They say 28% of all car accidents are caused by cell phone use.Okay. Now for the review.I've been using headsets while driving as soon as I started using cell phones back in the early 1990s. First it was the wired and then the wireless. The wireless was a great improvement because, of course, there was no cord but mainly because of the features a good bluetooth headset would have. Now we have hands-free units like the Jabra Freeway. Is it an improvement or just another option? My answer. I think it's a great option but it has one flaw. It's not as portable. If I go to a grocery store, for instance, I will undoubtedly have to call my wife with a question. Since I'm wearing my bluetooth I still have use of my hands so I can keep shopping. With the Jabra Freeway you can't do this. However it can do things that the in-the-ear piece can't do. Bring the Jabra in the house and use it as a hands free unit. Much louder and clearer then my Nextels internal speaker.PROS:Clear crisp sound with plenty of volumeVery easy to pair with phoneMicrophone cancels out most background soundsGreat looking style.

I'd like to improve my reviews so they can be more helpful to those who read them. Thank you.
4	1308009600	Wow, pairing was a snap. I have an iPhone 3GS, and it paired without having to put in the 0000 password. Very easy. The voice on this unit is very loud and clear.I LOVE the automatic linking. It has a motion detector, so when you get in your car the unit turns on and automatically links to your phone. That was the main reason I bought this unit instead of the lesser expensive unit.My main gripe is with the Voice Assist feature that is a separate service that you sign up for. Voice Assist for one year free is cool, saving $59. Will I go on Facebook or Twitter with it while I'm driving? Absolutely not.  I do like that you can hear text and say text while driving. What I DON'T like is how hard Voice Assist is to set up. I had read others say how hard it was, and thought, yeah, but I'm different... I can do it. No, it really is THAT difficult and at some point you will end up calling customer service for help.I also DON'T like that Voice Assist gives you a separate text phone number. Within 2 hours of setting up my Voice Assist account, I got SEVERAL junk texts. This is totally unacceptable. When I called Voice Assist customer service to tell them I never got spam texts before, they said, "Sorry, but it's not our fault." Yeah, right.  Because of this, I ended up canceling my Voice Assist account. So, I am running this unit without Voice Assist, and am still very happy with the unit.FYI .... if you buy this unit from Amazon, you MUST upgrade the software for Voice Assist. There's even a special link on the Voice Assist website that says if you bought the unit from Amazon, click here to update software. The problem is that this can only be done through a PC, because it is NOT Mac compatible! I really thought those days were gone, but I guess not.
5	1307750400	The Jabra Freeway is one of the most handy little gadgets that I have used when it comes to bluetooth and cell phones.  About the size of a half size of a paperback book, this speaker is really a handy little gizmo.The set up is really easy as the instructions are audio and integrated in the unit.  Each area of control on the unit is clearly marked and easy to access while driving.  The volume button on the unit is easy to reach and easy to use.  It is just sensitive enough so that it will work but not so easy that it is constantly being hit by mistake.The phone button (looks like a receiver of a regular phone) is a little hard to see if you are looking for it, as it curves around back of the unit, but it is easy enough to find that you don't really have to look for it.The voice commands are not always easy to use, however.  I have tested this unit with two phones- both Samsung Rugby phones.  When using the voice, you have to press the VOICE button on the unit, wait for it to tell you to "Say a Command" then say "Phone commands"  then the Rugby says, "Say a Command" through the Freeway speaker and you have to tell it what to do.  Sometimes I find that even though I am speaking clearly and saying exactly what needs to be said, the system gets messed up and I can not use the voice command again unless I reset the Jabra Unit, or sometimes I have to go back in and reset something on my phone.For instance, I told the phone (via Jabra Freeway) to dial a number that I had been using with no problem before.  Suddenly I was in some kind of research mode that I could not get out of.  I am not sure what the problem is yet- if the phone is trying to override the speaker or what, but it is frustrating.At that point, I have to shut the unit off and then turn it on again if I want to use voice commands on the Jabra Freeway unit.When leaving the vehicle, the unit connection does shut off but the speaker still is technically on.  It is best to turn it completely off at the end of the day, however, since it will stay charged longer.Also, when it gets really hot (like 120 degrees in a sun baked car) or really cold, I would not recommend leaving this in the car- it is easy enough to remove and replace, however, so it is just a matter of making a habit of removing it from the car in extreme heat or cold.Despite the frustration with having to reset on voice mode, if I just want to access the unit, I can easily press the buttons and use it that way until I turn the unit on and off again.Sound quality is fantastic- people remark that they can not hear the wind hardly at all when my windows are open, and I can also hear very clearly when the volume is not up too high.  In fact, sometimes I have to turn the volume down because people say I am talking too loud when I am barely speaking!  This is a huge change from all of my ear pieces!WHAT I LIKEThe voice commands are handy when they work.Speaker works beautifully even with windows openControls are easy to access and clearly markedLong talk timeClear soundPhone hooks up when entering car againWill tell how much battery talk time is left when askedWHAT I DON'T LIKEVoice does not always work wellSometimes have to reset phone when commands get mixed upRuns phone down faster when leaving car and coming back through a day- looking for bluetooth connection- but the unit itself holds charge really wellDespite some limitations, I still absolutely love the Freeway and compared to the Blue Ant S4, it is much easier to use, and much more handy to have in the car.  Compared to the Blue Ant S4, I find that the sound is similar, wind block is also similar, but the controls in the Blue Ant S4 frustrate me- they are hard to use and sometimes unresponsive.  The Jabra Freeway is superior in that department.  I like using it much better.  And it definitely beats any of the Plantronics ear pieces I have tried to use in the car.  I have gone through quite a few of them from the highest end to the most basic.I will be using the Jabra Freeway from now on in the car as long as it performs well.
4	1307664000	As I always do, I'll start this review with a caveat: I drive one of the loudest cars known to man, the 2009 Smart Brabus Coup.  I bought it used, and it came with some after-market mods ... a cold air induction system, a performance exhaust, etc ... suffice it to say that it grumbles like a race car, only in go-kart form.  It also has loud tires ... I'm not saying all this because I like to talk about my car (although I do) but because it's very relevant to this review.  The Jabra Freeway is a speakerphone, and as such it needs to enable communications via your cell phone.Now, because my car is loud, I've been trying to fix that with various soundproofing projects ... meaning I have interior noise readings (in decibels) at various stages.  I've also been testing the Jabra Freeway through this whole process for audio quality.  I've also  been testing other speakerphones ... including units from blueant and parrot.  The results are:Inbound Calls Quality (i.e., what you hear as the driver)==============This is the best sounding speakerphone unit fora  car I've every tested ... it sounds *beautiful*.  I never understood why anyone would want to stream music to a bluetooth speakerphone in their car when cars have stereos in them.  Well, this is still a far cry from a real stereo but it does sound nice, and incoming calls are easy to understand.Outbound Call Quality (i.e., how you sound to other people)==============This is where the testing came into play.  At every stage of my car sound-proofing project I would call my office phone during my morning commute and leave myself a voicemail (not because I'm that lonely, but because I wanted to hear what I would sound like to a caller).  I called during the same stretch of highway every time, and took dB readings.  The results: with internal decibel levels above 80, my voice could barely be heard, and when it was audible it still wasnt understandable.  It sounded like I was underwater or gargling or something.  Below 80 decibels, and the speakerphone could isolate my voice enough to be understandable, but it still wasnt clear until about 75 dB or lower.  75dB is fairly average for a normal car interior, making the Jabra Freeway a suitable car speakerphone.It should be noted that "noise peaks" (going over a bump, or coughing, or flooring the pedal to pass someone) can take a quiet car into the mid-80 dB range fairly easily.  It should also be noted that with my car, which has a rear-positioned engine, the noise cancellation sometimes got confused between my own voice and the rumble of the engine, causing it to "cancel" my voice for short blips if I was under full throttle.  This is probably because the noise cancellation is insufficient to distinguish between my voice (which is low) and an engine (which is low). I verified this by testing briefly in my wife's car -- the issue did not present itself there, because the engine noise was on the wrong side of the mic (I'm supposing).Also, at low speeds, or during normal city driving, the outbound quality was superb - many people didn't even know I was in my car.FINAL NOTE: while noise cancellation could have been better, it was MUCH better than any other speakerphone I tested.  And I tested almost every commercial model under $120.  (I did not test the dual-mic Parrot systems, which I hear are fantastic, because I wasn't looking to spend that much).Setup====One word: Easy.  Too easy to warrant much time on the subject.  With my iPhone 4, it detected and connected on its own, and was making calls with no other effort on my part.Operation=======Again: easy.  The buttons are large and well-positioned.  For my phone (iPhone 4) voice commands are passed through to the phone by pressing and holding the call button.  Incoming calls are announced clearly and loudly. I tested making and receiving calls, so I can't rate the FM transmission or other features.Battery======I've been using it off and on for about ten days, and I haven't had to charge it yet.  It goes into sleep mode on its own, and wakes up when it detects vibrations.  This means that when you open the door, the unit wakes.  It usually connects with my phone before I'm able to close the door again.Bluetooth=======Again, it connects very quickly.  And the range is ... almost too good.  With my car in the garage, standing in my kitchen, my iPhone would keep connecting and suddenly I'd lose the call ... well, not lose it -- it would simply be going through to my car.  This can be annoying, but easy enough to accommodate (turn the Freeway off manually, or turn off bluetooth on your phone).  Also, I'd rather have the range be too good than too bad.
5	1307664000	Been using this product for a week now and am very satisfied with the performance.  Very easy to setup, battery life is great, and most important, the clarity is fantastic.  People have not noticed at all that this is an in car speakerphone.  Music streaming quality is good as well, have found this unit handy on the road when using the voice guided GPS on my iphone  (Motion X) FM transmitter not really worth checking out due to the static, but that's to be expected with any FM transmitter.  I've owned quite a few other products (jabra cruiser, motorola, blue ant s4 etc) and this product is by far the best, well worth the price of admission.  Haven't activated the voice assist for emails/texts yet, but look forward to seeing what it can do!
5	1307664000	I am not typically a huge blue-tooth fan.  I have an earpiece that I use on long trips when absolutely necessary.  But other than that, I don't use on in my daily life.  When I have to make calls from my car, I tend to use my blue-tooth GPS unit which interfaces with my phone.  For me this does the job, but the FREEWAY has made me a fan!What's in the box?* The FREEWAY blue-tooth speakerphone* Mini-USB cable* "Cigarette Lighter" adapter.* Redemption code for one year of Voice Assist service.The device is very sleek looking and designed to fit nicely on your visor.  It is black modern look and curved edges blend with any car interior.  You could also sit it on your desk and use it as a hands-free speakerphone in an office setting.The button layout is minimal and easy to use.  At the top of the unit is a phone icon which is the Answer/End Call button.  This is the main button and can be uses to initiate/end calls. Also on the unit are buttons to raise/lower/mute the volume as well as FM and Voice buttons.The FM button lets you turn FM mode on or off.  FM Mode will let you pass calls/music from your smartphone through the FREEWAY and into your car radio.  I don't think there's any need to stream calls through the radio, as the whole point of a FREEWAY is that it's a speaker phone.  And the three sparkers on the device are pretty nice for their size.  However, if you ant to play music through this from your iPhone, etc and blast it through your car speakers, this feature does work.  I did find it to be slightly crackly, but that may vary depending on your location.The Voice button is used to prompt for voice commands.  Voice commands are simple to use and the unit's voice is easy to understand too.  There are several voice commands you can use: "Play Music" for playing music stored on your smartphone through the FREEWAY, "Battery" to check battery status, and of course "Answer", "Redial" and so on.  You can use your phone's voice dialing feature through the FREEWAY also, if your phone is so equipped.On the side of the unit is the On/Off slide switch and the mini-USB port.Overall, the FREEWAY is very simple to use.  It easily pairs with phones (up to two devices at a time).  After the initial pairing, as you come into range of the device with your phone, or as soon as you turn on the FREEWAY, it will announce that it is paired.Calls are clear and easy to make.  Simply press the Answer/End Call button and announce your commands.  Incoming calls are even easier as you hear the call alert and simply say `Answer' or `Ignore. The unit will also process calls through a quick tap of the answer/end button.  As far as clarity, I have been on both ends of a call using a FREEWAY and the sound is very clear and I've found the background/road noise is minimal and not disruptive of calls.  However, like any other microphone, it picks up sounds, so if there are periods of no talking, it will pick up whatever it detects.Battery life is excellent, and it gave me over 12 hours of talk time before the battery got too low, and standby time is advertised at over a month.  I care about this feature because the way I use a car phone is occasional but when I do use it, it's for several hours a day.  So I do not want to turn it on and find it needing a charge after a week or two of no use, and of course I don't want it going dead on a call.  Charging is also easy with the included mini-USB and car adapter.Voice Assist:  The Freeway comes with a free one year subscription to Voice Assist.  This is a very nice feature which transposes what you speak into the FREEWAY as a text message. You can also receive text messages and they will be read to you through the FREEWAY.Overall, a very nice product!
5	1307664000	The Freeway was so easy to set up.The voice clarity is superb.Easy to use.I have to rate this five stars. Works great with my LG enV Touch.Have it now for three days and ran it through all of the options and made many calls. Also subscribed to the free Voice Assistand that works great too. I highly recommend this unit
3	1307404800	Whether or not this device works for you will depend largely on your use of it.I do a lot of conference calls on my blackberry. The blackberry speaker and mic are good but not great, so I figured this would be a nice improvement. Since it's bluetooth, I also don;t have to deal with wires, and it becomes portable if I want to move from the car to my house of vice-versa. The bluetooth part works great, it pairs very easily and I've had no problem with that. The sound is good too, both for spoken voice and for music. The problem is the mic. As soon as I started talking people starting saying "huh? what? we can't hear you!" even in the noise-free environment of my home office. The small mic on my blackberry was far better than this speakerphone.So there you have it, and it all depends on your use. If you're mostly listening to music or podcasts in the car, then this is great. If you need to use it as a phone too, then you might want to look for something else.
3	1307318400	This is my second visor clip-on, bluetooth speaker phone and it's definitely superior, and more affordable than the last one I had. It has some features I really like and some I don't... so here's an overview of the pros and cons:Pros:-Low profile - doesn't occlude my view of anything-Firm clip - moving the visor around to protect my eyes from the sun doesn't make it start to wander-Sharp audible "Power on" and "Power off" announcements so you can flip the slider power switch w/o looking or wondering if you flipped it the wrong way-Sharp, audible "connected" announcement when it pairs with your phone-Utilizes the battery gauge display on your iPhone so you know by looking at the phone if the bluetooth visor gadget needs charging-Pair once and forget it - and it's very easy to pair the device - very-Easy-touch controls w/ audible tone as you volume up/down-Easy to answer a phone call while listening to music-Sends your music & podcasts via bluetooth from your phone to speaker - solves the problem of not having an AUX port in your car and not wanting to wear earbuds while driving-Very nice battery life - lasts during 4 hours of commute time (including both ways) daily w/o fail-When parked, or when going slowly in city traffic, callers state they can hear me clearly and I can hear them clearly.Cons:-When battery just gets a little low, audio quality gets scratchy as though phone has moved 30 feet out of range-When travelling faster than 35 mph, callers report not being able to understand everything I say and vice versa... sometimes unintelligible. No - I don't have a Rolls - you can hear road noise, but I'm in a new Beetle, not on a Vespa. After a certain speed (35 mph or faster), it becomes useless as a phone speaker - you can't understand anyone and they can't understand you - even if both parties scream-Top volume is not loud enough - even when listening to music or podcasts, I am straining to hear over road noise when going beyond 35mph. This is with volume settings on my iPhone at maximum and the visor speaker set at maximum-Doesn't retain volume settings after being turned off - have to bump the volume up from zero every time I turn it on-While other bluetooth devices allow you to voice dial on the iPhone (a built-in feature of the iPhone, supported by some devices), this Jabra FREEWAY speakerphone does not support voice dialing unless you sign up for their $59/yr plan.  The first year is free after purchase, but then you have to pay to continue to use voice dialing.-Cannot hear ringtones in speaker - all you get is "incoming call," - so you have to look at your phone (while driving!) to see who's calling (unless you subscribe to the annual service) - and when you answer the call, you hear a snippet of the custom ringtone you've assigned to that person, but too late - you've already answered-Not sure how 'virtual' the surround sound is supposed to be - but I'm not feeling/hearing anything that sounds like it's surrounding me - even when car is in Park.I did not sign up for the service (albeit free for the first year) simply because I don't want to forget about it later and start getting billed for something I won't want to use. My aux port is damaged in my car, so listening through my car speakers hasn't been happening for about a year. I prefer listening to my podcasts during my morning commute and started using my earbuds - I was hoping this would be the solution I needed - but I am so straining to make out what people are saying sometimes because of the volume limitation.I tried using the feature that allows you to answer calls via the speaker, and listen via your car speakers by tuning to an empty radio station. I called a friend to test it out and they could hear me, but I could not hear them at all. I do live in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metroplex and there is a lot of overlap - but there a couple of stations that are pretty much dead air that still weren't working. You could hear the dead air stop once the FREEWAY was connected to that station, but with my radio up all the way, I still could not hear the caller other than barely audible muffles - and my radio works just fine.If you are a city driver and are rarely taking calls on the open highway, then this device is likely what you've been looking for... but if you're typically cruising at 55-70 mph during your commute, you may find that having a phone conversation is next to impossible. This is a really nice looking product - looks and feels like it's made out of high quality stuff... but frankly, I'd rather have one that was the size of my entire visor, if needed, if it would really work where you could hear and be understood at highway speeds.
3	1306972800	First off, the sound quality is excellent and nobody I called was aware I was driving so it achieves its primary function very well. Setting up the unit is very easy - you simply pair the device with your phone in the same way as you would for a headset. It's also great how it will pair to two phone devices so both my wife and I can use it when we're driving together. The battery life is excellent too, only needing a weekly charge for reasonably heavy usage. The unit looks and feels solidly built and even the packaging is high quality and looks attractive.Then the minor problems start that begin to gnaw away at the overall usefulness of the device:- The unit frequently ignores my voice commands. For all intents and purposes, it appears to be paired successfully but nothing happens. I've even unpaired and repaired the connection and it still doesn't work. And there seems to be no pattern to whether it wants to work or not - in a single journey, it can be working when I set out and then fail later. When it's in this state it doesn't answer incoming calls either.- Having to press a button and then say "Phone Commands" only to be taken to the phone's own voice recognition system is redundant. Pressing the button should be adequate without having to say anything.- The minimum volume is *way* too loud. Given that it sits on the visor about 10 inches from your head, it means that you practically need earplugs for any caller with an above-average loud voice. Why it doesn't go lower than "very loud" is bizarre.- The FM transmission was unusable in both cars I tested in (a Yaris and a CR-V). It broadcasts to your chosen channel when parked but breaks up constantly when driving. Even when it's performing at its best, there's significant static.As some other reviewers have mentioned, Voice Assist is not easy to set up but works well once you've figured it out. As you might expect, you have to memorize a range of commands ("Send a text message", "Post to Twitter", etc.) To be honest, I'm not sure it's a great idea to be Tweeting and updating Facebook while driving but for people who are inclined to do so it's got to be better than texting while driving. You get one year of free service but it's not key to the core functionality of the unit.So I have mixed feelings about this product. I initially loved it out of the box but its flaws started to becoming annoying quickly and I've gone back to using myMotorola Oasis Bluetooth Headset (Black and Silver) [Motorola Retail Packaging].
5	1306886400	I decided to use this wireless speakerphone with my iPod Touch so that I could play live and loud music where ever I am. It is amazing and easy to set up. I just set up the bluetooth on my iPod by clicking a switch in the settings and then I turned the machine on and it connected. I then pressed play and music was playing!!!It is amazing. What a great and easy way to get a wireless speaker for my iPod Touch. However, it doesn't charge the iPod!
4	1306713600	This product has really solved my bluetooth problem in my car.  Earpieces either don't fit my ear, or let in too much noise relative to volume to be useful.  For phone calls this unit is perfect.  I can talk at my normal voice and be heard extremely well.  The sound through the unit for voice is just fine.The radio feature is nice, but suffers from what all other such devices, in my experience do, which is that there is too much static.  I think much of this is due to FCC limits on power output of these units, but the noise from this unit through the radio seems a touch worse that the others.  If you aren't looking to play music from your bluetooth device (I have my full music collection on my iPhone) then this isn't going to be a problem for you.  The sound from speaker on the unit is a bit small to really enjoy music, although it is very clear.I don't know if it just my unit or a problem with others, but the commands "battery" and "cancel" result in nothing being done.  Since "cancel" is easily done with a quick press of the phone icon on the unit, it's really only the battery command that is lacking.  All other voice commands work well, and the ability of the unit to access the phone commands on my iPhone make handsfree dialing extremely easy.
4	1306713600	This is a nice upgrade from the speaker we were using before:1.  It looks good.  Looks and feels like a quality product and fits in with the car interior.2.  Sound quality is excellent for a small speaker.3.  Instant On feature is a great.  One of the big annoyances of these car speakers is remembering to turn them on and off.  This one senses your presence.4.  Voice Activation is helpful while driving.If you don't have something built in to your car.  This Jabra is about as good as it gets.
4	1306627200	My iPhone 3GS connected instantly the first time I turned this on. Then I tried it with my wife's Panthec, likewise it was an easy process. The voice command instructs you how and what to do from the beginning, like turning on your Bluetooth, putting the 4 digit access numbers, etc. You can operate it handsfree by voice command. You just need to memorize a few basic command words to interact with the unit. The caller ID is announced through the speakers by the caller's name or the phone number if name is not available.The wire hooks at the back for attaching it to you car visor is very secured. All the buttons that you need are easily accessible. The only button that is harder to reach is the on/off button located on the right side, but there is no reason to use it as it has a 40-day standby time. Talk time is 14 hours. It charges by USB supplied cable and cigarette adapter. A home wall AC adapter is not included, but you can use your phone USB AC adapter or plug it directly to your PC.One of its best features is sound quality. For a 5" x 4.5" x 3/4" unit, it has 3 speakers that produce powerful and excellent audio. What it lacks is a physical audio input so you can attach your MP3 player directly. It can only play music via Bluetooth which may not give you the full range.As a Car Audio Transmitter:The FM function is not a radio receiver for radio stations; it is a transmitter to stream from your audio player/MP3 phone to your car radio using the FM. Just be aware, I have not found any radio transmitter that is interference free, which includes this one.The cool thing about this speakerphone is that the instant you enter your car, you will hear the speaker announce that you are connected. No need to fumble on your phone to press any buttons. This all happens in mere seconds.You can also use this inside your home if you are doing some chores; my wife used it when she prepared meal at the kitchen. As long as her phone is within the Bluetooth range (which is about 30 ft), the speakerphone works fine, loud and clear.Cons:The Bluetooth is very sensitive. It stays connected even if we go inside the house. This causes two problems:- drains the battery unnecessarily.- makes you miss calls as you don't hear the ring as it is ringing in the car.One solution is to turn off your Bluetooth on your phone.Included is a free 59$ value Voice Assist for 1 year to correspond with emails, Facebook or Twitter.
3	1306540800	I waited for a couple of months for this to become available, after I saw some on-line video reviews from the Electronics Show...when it finally came to Amazon (they're the only ones selling it), I ordered mine and it came a few days later.  I think I'm the only one to give this item a negative review (at least so far) but I'm sad to say I'm sending mine back.First off, it comes beautifully and simply packaged, and it is a gorgeous unit. It feels good, solid, and is well-designed. It rides beautifully on the visor. The buttons are clearly marked and they have a very satisfying 'click' to them (the entire cover panel is actually floating so that when you click any of the buttons, the whole cover pivots).  As you know, it comes with a USB cable so you can charge it from your computer (and get future software upgrades); the cable also plugs into an adapter plug so you can charge it in your car's accessory port (we used to call it a cigarette lighter), but remember the outlet in many vehicles is only powered when the key is on, so it will only charge while you're driving.The unit very easily paired with two cellphones, my LG Venus which is probably around 4 years old, and a friend's Droid Incredible. I was able to make calls by touching the 'Voice' button and saying 'Phone Commands' which connected the Freeway to my Venus's internal contact list. For the last couple of years, I've used a Plantronics Voyager Pro (earpiece), which almost always understands my voice commands (e.g., Call John Smith Mobile').  With the Freeway, my Venus frequently pulled up the wrong name (e.g., 'Did you say call Roger Thomas?')  I understand that it was my Venus that was getting the name wrong, but it was based upon information being relayed to it by the Freeway, which added a layer of error that I don't experience when using the Plantronics earpiece.The main reason I wanted to move from earpiece to speakerphone was so I wouldn't have to put on and take off the earpiece each time I get in or out of the car; I held out specifically for the Freeway because it's the only unit that turns on and off automatically. The auto-ON feature worked well, but the auto-OFF didn't always disconnect when arriving home. I'd park in the detached garage, and the Freeway would stay connected until I got to the far end of the house (a number of other reviews have noted this as well, and since the standard bluetooth range of 30 feet appears to sometimes be TOO much, maybe bluetooth units should come wih different range settings; at a motel or office where you park right in front of your room, the Freeway would probably never turn off.)The primary reason I'm returning my unit, however, is the loud background noise the microphones pick up. If I'm sitting at a stoplight with the windows up and no radio or fan going, it's okay, but as soon as I begin driving, or roll the window down, or turn on the fan or A/C, the person at the other end hears a lot of buffeting noise.  My friend and I switched phones AND took turns in the car with the Freeway so I could experience what the other person was hearing, and I have to say I wouldn't want to be on the other end of the Freeway for any longer than necessary.  Since my point of reference is my Plantronics earpiece, I have to compare the performance of the Freeway with the earpiece; With the Plantronics, I can be driving at full speed on the freeway with the window down, and the person at the other end hears little if any noise at all. I think they both use similar dual microphone technology, so maybe it has something to do with the fact that the Freeway is exposed on all sides to ambient noise, where an earpiece is shielded from at least some of that.My phone doesn't have a music player, so I didn't try the FM feature.All in all, the unit is very nice, the price is fair, and it is pretty user-friendly. It just didn't meet my expectations for call sound quality, so it's back to the earpiece for me.
3	1306540800	The Jabra Freeway is very sleek and comes with a free and optional one-year subscription to VoiceAssist.Setting the unit up was easy.1. Before I could use the Jabra Freeway, I charged it for two hours using the supplied USB cable with car charger.2. Next I made sure the cell phone was Bluetooth-enabled and turned on the Jabra unit.3. It immediately went into pairing mode.  As it is pairing with the phone device, the prompts on the phone needed to be followed and the supplied security code had to be entered (not everyone will have to enter a security code; it depends on the phone)4. After this I began making and answering calls using voice commands, checking the battery power of the unit, etc.  To make a call, I had to press the Voice button to wake up the unit and say "phone commands."  If I was unsure of how to speak to the unit I would say "What can I say?" and it would give me options.What I found very frustrating was:1. Once I was done with a call, ending the call is not hands free.  I couldn't say "hang-up, or cancel, or end" because that doesn't work.  Instead I had to press the "answer end button" (which is the "phone icon" on the Jabra device) or end the call via the phone end button.2. I also disliked having to press the Voice button every time I wanted to make a call because this meant it was not totally hands free.  The only hands free part is if someone is calling you, the unit then automatically awakes and you can tell it to "answer" or "ignore" the incoming call.3. Many times I asked the unit to make a call.  Twice it brought up the EZ tip calculator, once it brought up the one-minute beep "application," and another time it brought up some other application on the phone that I didn't ask for.  Another time I tried to call someone and instead it brought up the address book and rambled off both the mobile and work number without giving me the option to dial either one.What I really loved was the optional VoiceAssist package even though I had difficulty getting this set up because the code to redeem the free one-year subscription was hidden underneath a sticker either Amazon or the manufacturer put on the box.  However, VoiceAssist has the best live customer service around.  In fact we called each other almost five times to get this situation resolved in a few hours. Hopefully, new purchasers won't have this experience where the offer code is hidden between stickers and impossible to read even after being held up to the light.Below are the steps I took to get VoiceAssist to work:1. I had to first redeem the free offer code on the box by going to [....].2. Once signed in online to [....],  I imported all my Gmail contacts into the VoiceAssist application and also set up a connection to my review_maven twitter account ([....]).3. Once registered and after I cleaned up the Gmail import which had about an 85% accuracy rate, I then needed to program the number of 949-257-0923 under the name of VoiceAssist into the Bluetooth phone.4. After this I had a lot of fun:-  I used the Jabra unit to call VoiceAssist.- Once connected I used another set of VoiceAssist commands to "call" people in my contact list (they had to have a phone # in the Gmail contact listed that was imported), to "post to Twitter," to "read my e-mail" on Gmail--which it read very well (except it said it couldn't read the pictures), and to send an email, which it sent okay though some of my message was garbled.  However, since an MP3 was attached to the email, the person receiving it could play that to get the full message.- The two posts to my Twitter account were okay, buy it got VoiceAssist wrong and typed voices instead and it typed Jabra as Java. You can look on the review_maven account to see the posts for May 28. 2011.I didn't have the phone functionality to try the FM Transmitter or play music features of the Jabra device.Below are some of the key features that I liked and some things I disliked:PROS:1. The Jabra unit is pretty easy to set up2. The Jabra Freeway has a long battery life (about 14 to 17 hours)3. You can pair two Bluetooth phones to the device with the last phone paired being the primary one4. Jabra Freeway comes with a car charger for charging in your vehicle or with a 12Volt Battery Pack; the USB cable that is used to plug in the car adapter can be used without the adapter for charging with your PC5. A free one-year subscription to VoiceAssist is supplied with purchase6. Voice Assist understands commands better than the Jabra unit itself7. I could check and send email and post to Twitter with VoiceAssist (Posting to Facebook is also possible.)8. VoiceAssist provides SUPERB customer service.CONS:1. VoiceAssist setup was difficult and the instructions that came with the device did not tell you to program in the telephone number to VoiceAssist.  Instead the Jabra instructions tell you to call VoiceAssist making you assume it's already pre-programed in the device.2. Managing your contacts online in the VoiceAssist web site is somewhat cumbersome as the tool is in its infancy. For instance, every time I edited one of my 100+ contacts it kept going back to the first one after I saved the edit--then I had to scroll through the entire list again to go back to where I wanted to in the contact list.3. Answer/End button is not intuitive on the Jabra unit (it's the phone icon on the Jabra Freeway); although the instructions do tell you where it's located.4. The Jabra Freeway did not always understand my voice commands  Voice Assist understood my commands much better but  that still was not perfect)5. Jabra is from the UK and only an automated help line is provided along with a website.  Other than this you can send an email and wait for a response--no live support hereIn summary, although Jabra will work with any Bluetooth phone, I did not feel I could get it to work exceptionally well with the Verizon LG phone I tried it with.  I cannot be sure whether it was because of my or my boyfriend's voices (as we both tried it), the phone, or just the functionality of the device.  Despite this, the Jabra Freeway is a very sleek unit and I felt that it responded better the more familiar I got with the device.  In addition, the other reviewers are raving about the Freeway.  Although VoiceAssist was not perfect, I absolutely loved that optional add-on.Updated May 30, 2011 - I sent an email to Jabra with two simple questions to see how responsive their email support was and I can tell you it's great.  I sent it over the weekend and got a response this morning.  The only thing that wasn't great was that one of my simple questions was answered wrong.  I had asked where the answer/end button was and according to the manual it is the phone icon on the Jabra device; however the reponse I got was to "Slide the On/Off power switch to turn the speakerphone on or off" so the question was either misunderstood or the tech did not know the answer. I think it's the former.Updated November 7, 2011 - I recommended this to a former colleague and this is what he said about the device verbatim. "Regarding the Jabra device, it has worked very well.  I will admit, I have not used any of the advanced features much (other than initially playing with them) as honestly I have not needed them.  It has strictly been used as a straight bluetooth device and for that purpose it has worked extremely well.  The speaker quality is above and beyond competing devices and the functionality (recognizing bluetooth connections regularly, turning off when it doesn't detect a device, etc) are features that are useful and allow it to stick out from the pack of competing devices.  Overall, it has proven useful when I needed it."

It is easy to use, the buttons are flush and pretty easy to press without looking.The battery seems to last forever.The only possible criticism is that the visor clip could be a bit firmer.  The visors in my car are fairly thin and this moves around a very small amount.I like this a lot.  Highly recommend.

5	1306281600	Jabra has quickly become my go-to company for Bluetooth audio. After going through dozens of headsets, the Jabra Extreme ended up being the perfect one. Similarly, this unit doesn't disappoint.A pet-peeve for me with Bluetooth devices is the ease of connecting and disconnecting devices and this unit pulls it off flawlessly. Right out of the package it enters into pairing mode and gives you pleasant voice-instructions on how to proceed. Adding a second device is just as easy. Every time I power it on, it lets me know how many devices are connected. I connected it to both my phone and tablet computer and it intelligently knows how to prioritize audio. I was listening to music through my tablet and a voice call through my phone quickly took over the unit. As soon as I was done with the call, the music kicked back in. Simple voice controls are also included and I can command the unit to pause, play and skip through my music.As for audio quality, it's TOP NOTCH. I almost find myself wondering why Jabra doesn't market this unit as a portable boom box of sorts. I can't believe how loud it gets. And it even adds a healthy dose of bass. I couldn't be happier with the sound quality. Callers on the other end also remarked that they couldn't tell I was on a bluetooth speaker phone, another testament to the excellent audio.All in all, five stars. It's a bit on the pricier side, but that's the cost of a no-fuss unit that won't leave you in a lurch in the middle of a call. Kudos, Jabra.
4	1306195200	Upon receiving this from Amazon Vine, I was expecting something larger based on the images for the product on the web, but to my surprise, this little Bluetooth in-car speakerphone is very compact and solid ... a quality made product.I found the Jabra Freeway to be extremely easy to set up and get connected via Bluetooth.  By default the voice guidance and commands are enabled when I first turned on the unit and I was very impressed with the clarity and quality of the sound.  Speaking voices were very easy to understand.  Getting started and pairing the Jabra with my cell phone was super easy for me.  I really liked having the voice guidance to get it all going.  This, also, can be turned off if a person does not want the voice guidance.Answering and making calls worked very smoothly and the voice commands and voice recognition worked without any problems.  The included micro-USB connector cable and accessory charger charges this unit in about 2 hours.  The Jabra has an impressive talk time charge and an even more impressive standby time.I am very happy with my Jabra Freeway ... it does everything I want it to do for now. Quality, compact, and sounds great .... recommended.
5	1306108800	This is my second Jabra device. My first one was one of those devices that stick in your ear, and those are super awkward and uncomfortable, so I used it a grand total of about three times. The Jabra Freeway is in a league of its own, though. This thing is AWESOME! It's super easy to hook up to your smartphone (I have an iPhone 3GS), simple to use, and delivers great quality surround sound. I really only use this for making and receiving calls, but it also has the capability to stream GPS directions and music from your phone to your car radio (AWESOME for iPhone users). The Freeway also comes with a free one-year subscription to Voice Assist, which lets you do things like send texts, write e-mails, and post Facebook updates while using voice-activated commands. CRAZY STUFF! I am amazed this thing doesn't do your laundry for you...surely that feature will be offered with the next model, because that is seriously where this technology is headed. This is a great, high-quality product...easy to use, great battery life, and all these insanely cool bonus features that make using a speakerphone more fun than you ever imagined possible. I highly recommend this product!
5	1306108800	AS someone who often struggles with setting up electronics, I was leery of the easy directions.To start with, I have an iPhone 3G. I had never used the BlueTooth program on it and did even have an idea where it was located! However, it only took a second to find that it's under "settings" and then General.All you have to do is turn the BlueTooth from off to on, and it will automatically connect to the Jabra Freeway.That's it.You're good to go (though you do have to charge it for 2 hours in your car before using initially).It's so easy to use...simply press Voice and say "Phone Commands" and it will prompt your phone to then turn on, and that's when you say, "Call Bob, mobile" (or whoever).Since it's using BlueTooth, it automatically recognizes all your contacts.The thing to remember is to say "Phone Commands" when you hit the Voice button...when I first used it, I stopped looking at the directions and just kept saying "Call Bob, mobile."After I called a few people with testing with windows up/down/radio on - I can tell you, the speaker phone is amazing. Crisp and clear. The ONLY thing is - the volume wouldn't go any lower at a certain point, and I couldn't quiet my "loud" talking friend (so I just moved the speaker over to the other side of the car).I was excited that I could stream my iPod playlist (on my iPhone) over the speaker! All you have to do is hit Voice and say "Play" and it's good to go!You can also transmit over an FM station - the voice prompt lady will tell you what station to tune into.It was a bit fuzzy - and I don't have great speakers anyway, so I'm just as happy to listen to my music (and podcasts!) over the Jabra Freeway.Another great feature; it can sync to 2 smart phones at the same time. This is great because that means my husband can sync his iPhone to it and if he is going on a long car ride or, better yet, if we are both going on a long car ride, we can each use the speaker (we have very different music taste).Ladies, men are difficult to buy for, but I know this gift would be appreciated every single day.And men, yes, women love romantic gifts, but this gift says "I love you and what to make sure you stay safe!"I'm also thinking this would make a great gift for a new driver or an old driver.My parents are vivacious in their gray haired years, but they are not keen on electronics. It took them 3 months before they admitted they had no idea how to hook up their iPods to their computer.The first thing I thought when I set up the Jabra Freeway - was that my parents could do it.The only thing they probably would scratch their head at would be how to find their BlueTooth setting, but once they know that, it's super easy!Also, you don't HAVE to use this only in your car!I do have a home office I work out of, and hate using the speakerphone on my iPhone - the Jabra works like a charm and sounds awesome. Also, we do alot of cooking on the weekends - it's awesome to use in the kitchen because can talk hands free while still chopping veggies or stirring the spaghetti sauce.It also comes with a free trial (free for a YEAR) for Voice Assist - where you can stay linked in with social media/internet. It will read you your emails, send test messages, etc.I will be taking advantage of this and will offer feedback after I've used it for a week or 2.All in all - I'll be buying this for my parents for their anniversary AND my husband for Father's Day - because I know if we only had one,  we'll both fight over who gets to keep it in the car.
5	1306108800	They just keep cranking out improvements for Bluetooth users these days...Right up front I have to say I was very surprised to hear how clear & loud this speakerphone is, one of my main concerns was being able to hear it well in the car, but does not seem to be a problem at all.Although, I'm sure there could be times with the window open in traffic that nothing would be loud enough.Unit comes with the "help" voice turned on and will get you going even without reading the manual.  Then the built in voice will tell you what is going on when you use the Freeway... you can even ask for a list of what you can ask.  You CAN turn this feature off if you don't like it.Worked so well in the car that I don't want to leave it there and brought it in the house to use as a speakerphone inside also.  Range is the same 30ft as most all other Bluetooth items.Happy to say, Jabra is still using their dual microphone noise reduction feature to cut background noise.Had to get used to the fact that you need to speak to the "Freeway" with commands and then to your phone to use voice commands your phone has on it.  Nothing bad, but throws you at first if you are used to going directly to your phone.  Saying to the Freeway unit "Phone Commands" will have it open my phones voice command center and then my phone will ask for a command as normal.The key to hearing stereo music through the Freeway is if your music player/phone has A2DP or not.All the latest equipment has it, but some slightly older ones might not, so you might not be able to stream music and podcasts to the Freeway.Also can make connections with your GPS unit if it has A2DP.  Many combos possible, GPS, Phones, computers etc.Not sure about the need for "Voice Assist" subscription (comes with one year free) but was good to find that you still have voice commands built in to use without using the "Voice Assist".If you subscribe you can also do text and Email by voice, plus post to Facebook and Twitter if you really want this.  No download required.Good for some I guess, and much better than texting with hands while driving of course.Also, it seems your subscription is not limited to just one device and you can use any of your phones with it.  May very well be some restrictions in that regard but I am not going to subscribe to the service at this point in time.  Best to visit the Voice Assist web site for more information on their service....Be sure to read the FAQ page on the VoiceAssist web site.It has a USB connection so unit can have new firmware downloaded and installed if it ever becomes needed.  Also charges through the USB plug either with the included auto adapter, or with USB on PC.One thing I'm reading and I'm not sure about is the tech specs for max temperature of 113 degrees F and Min of 14 degrees F.  I do believe it can hit 113 degrees pretty easy in a closed car in the Summer.And for some users, 14 degrees F MIGHT be too common in the car overnight.  Not saying it's a problem, but be aware of the numbers.Wish I could say the FM transmission to your radio is greatly improved, but seems to be about the same as older releases of any brand.  Again, this could vary with radios and FM areas etc.As with other Jabra items, you can download a PDF user manual at their web site to review before purchase.Not in use all that long here yet so will be happy to report back with any additional findings, good or bad.
