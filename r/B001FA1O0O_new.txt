1	1400371200	The description did not include the fact that the ear bud jack did not work. Who wants an iPod with no ear bud jack?
1	1400284800	I purchased this for my daughter, its STUCK in connect to iTunes, did NOT come with charger or ear buds at all. This was supposed to be a birthday present.
5	1400284800	At the time, I did not have a smart phone and this iPod came in handy every single time.  Now I have an iPhone, but I really do miss the iPod touch.  It was awesome
5	1400025600	This was an excellent buy and from a good buyer who shipped it and packaged it very well. Had no complains with the iPod after getting it. Excellent condition. Brand New. The only complaint I have is getting it stolen from me at a party! Other than that it was a great buy and I recommend it to anyone else out there looking for one.
4	1399420800	Everything on this refurbished iPod works well, with the exception of the home button. I have trouble with it not responding to me pressing it on many occasions.
5	1398816000	Bought this for my girlfriend as she doesn't have a phone, but usually has wifi around her. Durability is great, especially since it's lasted her over half a year.
5	1398816000	The IPOD I purchased has been wonderful. No complaints whatsoever. Everything functions well, delivery was speedy & there were even a few &#34;extras&#34; included.
1	1398816000	This is actually a good product - i already have one. This seller is buying defective units and passing them off as new. The unit i received had the cover detached due to a bulging battery that had gone dead. Needless to say, it didn't even turn on. I am waiting for refund. Amazon has to do a better job evaluating its outside vendors.
5	1398643200	I got exactly what I ordered quickly, and have found no faults with it to this point. I would recommend this product for people looking for this type of device.
5	1398556800	The Apple Ipod touch works well, despite being refurbished, and I have had no problems with it.  My previous ipod's screen was cracked badly, and the home button stopped working, so this one is nice.
1	1398384000	The fact that you posted LIKE NEW makes me mad i am not taking down my previous review the screen is even on the ipod its just taped there and you wont give me my money back. Do not BUY
5	1397606400	Bought this a few yrs ago for my grandaughter. This has been a great ipod. She is still using it.
1	1397433600	Purchased this and didn't check charging port.  Will no longer charge.  Really frustrated that it can't be returned or fixed.
1	1397088000	Been nothing but headaches with this item.  Bought it for my grandaughter.  Usage was contolled.  Never left the house. Two cracked screens, yes, she dropped it once.  Second one just cracked.  It spent 8 months literally loading.  Support was no help.  One day recently she turned it on and it worked.  Upgraded her to a Nexus tablet for Christmas.  She loves it.  No issues so far !!
5	1397001600	She can do so much more with this one than she could have with the older Ipod Touch Gen 1 that she started out with.
4	1396828800	Works well and has many features to keep your child occupied.  The ability to facetime with other friends is important for the child.
5	1396742400	Exactly as described. No noticable scratches or nicks/dents at all. A great product for a great price. Couldn't be happier!
5	1396742400	Well-made, fun to use, very handy.  Apple does put a lot of thought into its merchandise, and that policy shows in this iPod.
4	1396483200	Working so far I don't want to give it 5 stars cuz it might be a risk buying one in case u get a faulty one
5	1396396800	All of my expectations were met & that does not often happen to me!  It waived in the time frame, the quality was as good or better than described.  Absolutely happy!!
1	1396224000	I love the iPod products but do not buy one through Universal Media Sales.  They sent me an iPod that had an old iPhone for a back.  Upon inspection at the Apple Store I was told that other parts of the iPod were pieced together from different generations.  This is why it never quite worked right.  I tried contacting them to no avail.  Do not waste your money!
5	1396224000	This is excellent, will buy two of them ..... one of 8GB and another 32GB ... arrived in perfect condition. Work great ... I love it
4	1396137600	Now with new smart phone it sits in drawer. was sort of fun when new, but I would never buy another.
5	1395964800	Received this item in a timely manor and it works great... No problems and I am glad that I use amazon... I feel like for the most part I have not been disappointed.
4	1395878400	we ordered this waning the black color paid more for the black and guess what we got white.  but its a great tool for the kids. I control the music they listen and play on it. have used to learn to use the rubber band loom
5	1395705600	This is a very good product.  My son is still using it after several years.  It has went through the washing machine and after about a month, it finally dried out.  It is working just fine now.
5	1395705600	I purchased this item for my teen-age daughter, she said she loves it and goes absolutely no where without it.
4	1395705600	Ordered this for a christmas present for my son and he loves it!! I think the 4th generation is a great way to see just how a smaller child will take care of property before buying a brand new one.  The condition was good, but the charger received with it did not work.
2	1395532800	The seller who sold me this wiped the serial number so I could not update the software through i-tunes. Also the power button stopped working after the second day of me getting the i-pod. The product sold to me is now useless and I wish i did not purchase it in the first place. If you purchase a used I-pd touch do the following:-Have low expectations-Make sure you are buying from a credible source-Make sure the i-pod has a recognizable serial number-Be careful updating software
5	1395532800	It's just what i wanted loved it came sooner than expected ................Don't no what else to say other than i enjoy having it
5	1395360000	I bought this for my grandson. He absolutely loves it. The value was excellent and I had searched all day in NYC to find one.
4	1394668800	I bought this ipod for my birthday for 85.00 and was very scared that the ipod was going to be ruined. I got the ipod in 4 days. It had absolutely no scratches at all. It is working great, the only thing wrong is it is a bit slow but other than that this is a great seller and great product. :D
5	1394582400	My Grandson bought it and loves it! He shopped around and found that one was the best for his money!!
5	1394582400	You already know everything you need to know about this... iPod Touch at a decent price. Runs all standard apps fine.
5	1394496000	it works great and got it much cheaper then the one on wall-mart site. It comes in a timely matter.
1	1394496000	I chose this rating cause the iPod don't work right and keep over heating the battery in it. I'm very unhappy with the products. I will never buy from amazon again.
5	1394064000	Bought this for my Son , He injoys it alot . He likes all the apps it has, and what he can do on it.
4	1394064000	Still learning about it but so far so good.  Alot of different things to do with this...I'm just getting started.
4	1393718400	Because it was a good price. And it was what my granddaughter wanted. And I didn't have to go to a store.
5	1393632000	For my daughter. She loves it! It came fast and it was like new! I am so happy I ordered this product through u guys
4	1393286400	Item was received in a timely manner in the condition in which was stated. Only issue, the write up stated that it had a mint green colored screen, yet it was not, something that my child was looking forward too. Just a little disappointed.
2	1393027200	I was not satified with the IPOD. The battery doesn't charge right and the charger is not in good shape. Something is loose on the charger.My son is not happy with it.
5	1392940800	It's the iPod touch with the FaceTime camera and is 8GB. It has a cleAr screen and good speakers for media.
3	1392854400	The ipod itself is in excellent shape and came a day ahead of time i would have given it 4 or 5 stars but the new metal back that they put on the ipod doesn't fit the way it supposed to and the right side sticks out of it im a little worried it might come off one day :-/
4	1392768000	I love my ipod touch it sound great and I have no problem what so ever, I recommend this product.
4	1392681600	Our new used iPod is great. We use it everyday.  It plays nice and clear and works good!Thank youAsta Fusco
4	1392681600	Everything looks good and my granddaughter will love it. It is small enough for her to use and large enough to read the icons.
5	1392681600	It for my daughter for her 16 th birthday I'm very pleased with this. So will my daughter! Thank you so much!
3	1392422400	Cannot get the apple ipod id to upload to the internet.  Maybe cause it was already in use, but tried changing it an cannot do anything with it
5	1392336000	I broke my iPod and wanted the exact iPod 4th generation to replace it. Everything works beautifully. Thank you for selling.
5	1392336000	My grandson is six, this is perfect for him. He can use it for hours when inside. He and his brother each has one.
5	1392076800	Bought as a Christmas gift for my 14-year-old son. He's still using it and loves it after 2 years. It's lasted longer than the Otterbox we bought to protect it.
5	1391817600	So above my expectations the product came and when I opened it .......amazing. product was perfect and in perfect condition. The little dent that it was talking about having you couldn't even see it if you wasn't looking for it..WILL DEFINITELY ORDER FROM YOU GUYS AGAIN Thanks a million
5	1391731200	This ipod was bought as a gift, so I haven't used it myself, but the recipient is very happy with it. It is a very nice music player, plus you can install skype and make phone calls and video calls from everywhere, provided you have a wifi connection.
5	1391644800	My 15 year old grandson is in heaven!  This has become a part of his body now like an ear or a finger.  The iPod was in excellent condition upon arrival, in fact I thought it looked new.  It works perfectly also as my grandson tells it, personally I would not know about that myself.  I would highly recommend this seller, Bravo!
5	1391472000	Could definitely tell this was a used ipod but works great. My daughter loves it and has been playing with it every second she can!
4	1391385600	ipod was just as described, gave it to my son for a christmas gift and he uses it all the time.  so glad i did not spend the extra money to get a brand new one
3	1391212800	Sometimes it is to slow and takes a while to down load games and music. I wish it was faster otherwise I am happy with it
4	1391212800	I liked the player in all fits music good but you should just put the songs you like not albums it adds up quickly it was what I expected that's all.
2	1391212800	the ipod works pretty good, however, we only had it for about three days and with a protector on it the ipod got dropped and therefore the screen cracked in the corner and had a crack across the top.  I am very unsatisfied as to the quality of material that was used for the screen.  We had another ipod for about 4 years and it has no cracks or anything on the screen.  When I contacted the supplier they was willing to replace the screen for a cost of about $58, which after buying the ipod and then replacing the screen we would have been better off to buy one brand new.  Needless to say we aren't getting the screen fixed and with a protector that hides the cracks and shatters then it makes me feel like that aren't there.
5	1391126400	what can you say about Apple products, Excellent value, great price, rapid delivery.  Who could ask for more?  A perfect choice  I could not be more pleased with  this purchase
1	1391040000	I bought it used, it last2 weeks only! No picture screen working anymore. I can hear suri but can not see a damn thing on the screen anymore it blacked out and does not work. I have brought it to repair person and they say un fixable! So I just bought another from a more reliable seller here on amazon... And new. No more refurbished!
5	1391040000	This product does as it was designed to do. I've had no problems with it performing as expected. I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a compact handy computer.
4	1391040000	its ugly and stupid i can't believe they are trying to sell this junk. what nut lug would bye this
3	1391040000	The rating would have been higher if the ipod worked better. But the ordering and returning was very easy and clear. Just waiting on the adjustment to the credit card. When the comes through the rating would go up.
5	1390953600	I can do everything on this little ipod that needs to be done when I don't want my phone on.
5	1390867200	I had shoulder surgery and my husband bought this for me to keep me entertained while I wasn't allowed to do anything. I love it & take it everywhere!
5	1390694400	Work perfectly. Minimal scratches on the back, no cracks, good speakers, I've had some trouble with the WiFi connection though.
5	1390694400	I bought this about 2 years now, and although the screen cracked (hopefully will get fixed) it is a great tool!
4	1390608000	I got this for my 14 year old brother as a birthday/christmas gift. It arrived in great condition and earlier than expected. Only issue I have is that the home button was difficult to press. We have since found a way to rig it to press it. Initially, it ran a little slow. Apps such as temple run and subway surfers would glitch alot at first But overall it'll do for a used ipod.
5	1390608000	My 9-year-old son bought this (used) with his birthday money.  It does just what he wants it to do...mainly play games and play music. Works great.
4	1390521600	My son is content with his iPod touch 4, 4G, it does have scratches on screen and it was not specified but it's doable.  After ordering new face screen's seems to be not that easy to do, now we need help on where to go to replace the face screen's. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
5	1390435200	Use it a lot as a dictionary, alarm clock, calculator, reminder, regular clock, and play games on it. The GB are a little limited but that's fine with me. It's good for snapping pictures that you would otherwise miss.
5	1390435200	I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son a few years ago and he still enjoys it now. It is a quality product and has entertained him alot.
5	1390262400	The shipment was very fast I just the the product nice condition  I would highly recommend  It was what I had expected its wonderful Thankyou.
4	1390176000	This is a very nice product, just what I need.  No problems at all.  You will need to get a case for it.
4	1390176000	Work really good until the top and home button brokeyes i would recomend this product have a goood dayyy
5	1390176000	Excellent portable music player, besides take my music as far as I want, allows me to play, process documents and communicate while possessing a wifi connection. I feel great.
5	1389916800	I got an iPad, so i gave this to my little brother. The iPod touch 4g wasn't bad at all. If you cannot afford the iPhone or the newest iPod touch, this one will do. You can use it as a phone as well using the free text apps they have!
2	1389916800	Nice, but very small reading surface.  Battery doesn't last very long.  Light weight for carrying around in a pocket. Would not recommend.
1	1389916800	this product lasted my daughter one year then just stop working.so yeah get extended warranty. that's all I can say will not buy from this company again
4	1389830400	This was a present for my daughter. It has worked just as well as one right out of the box as far as we have seen. Great purchase.
1	1389744000	This iPod was not well refurbished. It is slow and continually freezes, force quits and shuts down. It also is difficult to turn back on. It doesn't hold a charge and the wire is coming off of the charger.  I am not a very happy customer. If i ever have to buy a refurbished Apple product again then i will purchase directly through Apple.
3	1389657600	It really would have been nice to actually get the white one I ordered  not black.  Other than that its great .
5	1389571200	We purchased a new ipod 4th generation last year for our older daughter.  We thought an ipod 4 would be great for our younger daughter.  The ipod 4th generations have been discontinued, so we decided to go with a refurbished model.  it is great.  hardly any cosmetic blemishes.  It was all ready to go when we got it, all the setting were set to factory settings so it was just like getting a new ipod!!!
5	1389571200	This product is the best in the world I love to have it, I will buy it again if I have more money.
1	1389571200	I was very disappointed this item worked fine at first but then started messing up it would randomly shut off and you can not take it off the charger without it shutting off
5	1389571200	This is the perfect way to start a kid with an iPod !  Not brand new but still in great shape !!! Thank you !
5	1389484800	My daughter wanted an iPod touch really badly. She had an iPod nano and loved using it. So I purchased a used/refurbished one on Amazon. Unfortunately for me, my refurbished experience didn't work and the unit didn't charge. But the seller returned my money once I returned the item. I didn't want to disappoint my daughter for Christmas so I put a plea on Facebook and asked if anyone had a used one they were willing to sell. Luckily, I had a good friend who was willing to part with hers - for a great price! So on Christmas day, she opened it up and screamed and screamed with excitement. She has had no trouble learning to use it and has enjoyed playing apps, using the internet (with a lot of supervision) and using it as her iPod as well.It is responsive and easy to use. A great investment for us, even though it is one generation behind.
5	1389312000	Product was exactly as described, arrived when he said it would, and he kept me informed every step of the way.
5	1389225600	It was just as described. Grand daughter loved and it came quickly. Works well and she knows what she is doing with it.
4	1389225600	I ordered the 4th generation due to having a Bose sound dock that the newer generation wouldn't fit on. The case that it came in was cracked allover, immediately I was concerned that the iPod would be damaged but luckily it was fine. The reason I don't give five stars is it doesn't have the capability to listen to local radio stations. Advice though buy different earphones the ones included are big and hurt your ear, wish apple would include some decent earphones with the iPod. The front and rear cameras are a plus.
5	1389225600	I bought the Apple iPod touch primarily to play games with friends.  I also found a plethora of apps that are helpful for everyday living.  From the Weather Channel app to the AT&T UVerse app where I could set up recordings of my favorite shows, with the iPod touch you can get it all!
5	1389225600	I bought this for my 7 year old son who is very hard to keep entertained but the puschase of this item has done the trick he feels like he is a big boy with his texting app also he is able to listen to music and play lots and lots of games....
5	1389139200	I received it fast and in working condition. Only problem is home bitten is starting to not work. Other then that's it works fine.
5	1389139200	I started out with the first generation ipod touch when it first came out on the market and was blown away by the music and video capabilities.  I really didn't see where there was any room for improvement but was pleasantly surprised that it's even better now--crisp, clear, and simply amazing video and audio capabilities.  I love that you can listen to it without speakers now (unable to do this on first generation).  Safari is an exceptional browser and you can surf the internet very quickly.  There is an abundance of free apps in all categories that are high quality and entertaining.  I have begun using my laptop less because I have found the ipod touch to be faster and more portable.  I can access my bank accounts and email faster on the ipod touch than any other electronic device I've used!  This device will definitely please.  Easy to set up and use and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and from all backgrounds.
5	1389052800	this is my general comment about apple's products, well made, sturdy and robust, nice interface, and built to last. Great for pre-teens
5	1389052800	As advertised.  Works well ad is everything my son wanted for the Holidays.  Now he can use Bluettoth and send Dad texts.
5	1389052800	This was a very cheap ipod. it was as the description said-like new. it was so well preserved like it was never used. No charger though.
4	1389052800	it has not left her hands since she got it. she loves it. she has asked for nothing sice recieveing it
3	1389052800	NO WHAI I EXPECTED8 GB WAS NT ENOUGH FOR MY MUSIC AND VERY HARD TO CONTROL HAD TO VISIT THE APPLE STORE FOR IMFORMATION
5	1388966400	Product was as described and I recieved it very quick!!!! I got it for my daughter for Christmas and she hasn't put it down since she opened it :)
5	1388793600	My son's big Christmas gift and he has not put it down!  There was an issue with the mailing but I was helped immediately and the gift arrived on time!
5	1388707200	I would recommend this to anyone who listen to music all the time and plays games on your phone. Works great just make sure you get one with more MB, this one is great for my son but if you have a lot of music and games get at least the 64MB model!
5	1388707200	Purchased this item for my teenager who has had problems with electronic things breaking and no lomger working.  Before spending $$$$, decided to give a try again for what I feel is a great deal.  There have been no issues or problems - great deal!
3	1388620800	Electronically, this device is exactly what it should be and I'm pleased.  However, when the posting said it would have a refurbished screen, I expected one that would be properly refurbished.  What we got was a screen that wasn't mounted all the way in the body along the bottom of the device.  Very disappointing and sloppy work.Also, the headphones seem to be cheap Apple knock-offs.
5	1388448000	Just love this a year later it works like a charm. I would buy again over and and over! Battery life is still exceptional!~ Mark
1	1388448000	I ordered this for my daughter for xmas. It is broken. the piece that you plug in & charge is missing & small teeth inside are bent! I have contacted the seller with no reply.I expect A full refund or at the very least A replacment Ipod. This is absolutly unexceptable! I will not be A return customer.
5	1388448000	They arrived looking brand new with all the promised accessories. I was very pleased and my grandsons love them (6 yr & 7 yr).
5	1388361600	When I bought this, it was a replacement product due to the fact that my other one cracked. I wasn't really looking for the newest generation of Apple product, so I found this one online and bought immediately. Needless to say, it held up as always, this time with a screen protector and hard case, and it's design and functionality remained untainted by Apple's string of most recent iOS updates. Absolutely loved it.
4	1388361600	Works great a little disappointed in all the scratches I thought in the discription it was minor but it was a little more beat up than I thought it would be but it works great and was for a child so I will still give them four stars and they had great follow up
2	1388361600	I chose this rating because I think that the ipod wasn't refurbished because it is very slow it cuts off at times, some times I loose my wifi signal.and when I get ready to type something im typing but the letters will not show up if im trying to play a game its moving in slow motion and all these things were not happening when I first got it they just gradually begin to happen so im really not satisfied with it
5	1388361600	Gift for grandson & he loved it.  He plays games on the darn thing which is what kids do now a days.  He was happy with it.
4	1388275200	The iPod was better than I expected!  No scratches or wear of any kind.  The only con I have is that the battery does not last very long.  This is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.
4	1388188800	i got this for my son for a late birthday present. he wanted it mainly because it had a camera and can do more on it than his kindle fire. the battery life(bought used) isn't anything like we would like it,but not really a surprise or complaint. it came quickly in the mail and wasn't damaged or other issues that weren't  listed by the seller.
4	1388102400	Bought this for my daughter for Christmas with fear it would come with something wrong with it..so far, so good. Was used, but the scratched and scuffs that it said it could have, were minimal and you can't tell at all. Came as stated and works great.
4	1388016000	Works well would recommend a 16 or 32 GB though because this one doesn't have much storage, BUT if you plan to only use it for like music and not have many apps it would be perfect for you. Hope this helped you decide whether you want to buy this product.
5	1388016000	Perfect condition. Delivered fast too. Charger was included which was very nice. Packaging wasn't original  box but was still very nice and kept it safe.
5	1388016000	Looks great.my 10 year old was thrilled.best present that she got for Christmas she said.front screen was without a blemish as promised.we are pleased.
4	1387929600	My daughter wanted this for her birthday.  Me not being tech smart bought a used one from a great buyer.  Showed up with a defective USB adapter for charging the thing from a wall socket.  Immediately they sent a new one.  Great product, great service.
5	1387843200	3 years later I still have these iPods. I bought 2 of them for my daughters and they love them. They play them daily and can sometimes be pretty rough with them, even leaving them outside and in the car as well as dropping them, spilling things on them, etc.  They were 3 & 6 when I bought these and now so you can imagine what they have been though.  These are extremely easy to use and learn for kids and adults. They are full of fun and educational games as well as very functional apps, a lot of them free!  These I pods are 3 years old and still work great. They are not as fast as our iPad 4 or iPad Air, but they're older and have much less memory as well.  I know there are other tablets out there, but the iPods and iPads are really easy for kids to use and learn on, which is really important for a homeschool family. I really, really recommend this for anyone!
4	1387756800	All was good. My expectations we're met and some. My daughter will have a big surprise for Christmas. Thank you.
5	1387584000	I BOUGHT THIS FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT AND SO FAR FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN, THE PRODUCT IS IN GOOD CONDITION, ITEM WAS DESCRIBED WELL.
5	1386892800	First off I am a senior citizen who really likes my 8gb 4th generation IPod touch.My first introduction to Apple products a while back was the Itouch 3rd generation Ipod touch.  I still have it.But now my 4th gen Itouch gets most of my attention.It's just a very well made electronic device that does so many things for me.For instance:  Last week as I did my daily 3 mile walk I listened to an audiobook. I also like to listen songs from my Itune collection too. I then plopped down at a Starbucks where I played Words With Friends and Scrabble for an hour or so while listening to sports talk radio on Tune In Radio and IHeart Radio.  That night I  Skyped my son in California (via Facetime) Imessaged free texts to some other Iphone/Ipod owners among my friends and family, read and sent email messages.  The next morning I got the current temp and weather forecast and then read a half a dozen online newspapers and favorite blogs.  I watched a You Tube video.  I then phoned my daughter in Illinois using the Text Me free app that turned my Itouch into a wifi phone.  That app also allows free texting anywhere in the U.S. and canada and some 40 countries.  The Itouch has been darn good  ereader too.  I download probably 3 or 4 books a month from my public library via the free Kindle and Overdrive Media Console apps.The Itouch is so portable.  I put it my pocket and I'm good to go.I have had it for almost a year now.  I bought this 8gb model online  for 129 dollars refurbished from Apple.  It arrived in a sealed,brand new box, the Itouch was sealed in plastic just as if I had bought it brand new from the Apple Store..only it was shipped from the Apple refurb factory in Hong Kong and arrived within a week after ordering with free shipping included in the price.  i went over the Itouch carefully and couldn't dectect a single scratch or dent.  The thing looks brand new.The Apple refurb factory completely goes through the device and puts in a brand new battery and puts a one year warranty on it.What's nice about that is if something goes wrong during the warranty you don't go through the hassle of having to mail it back from where it came from....no...because it's warranted by the manufacturer (instead of somebody operating a business out of their garage) you can take it to your nearest Apple store for service.I have dropped the Itouch a couple of times on concrete.  It survived both landings thanks to one of those silicone (rubbery) type cases I got on ebay for $2.99 and am glad I did. The case also came with one of those protective screens that I applied and it does keep the screen from scratches. The silicone case gives me a much better hold of the device and it isn't apt to accidently slide or be knocked  a table so easily because it has more traction to it.In that the the 4th gen Itouch has been discontinued by the manufacturer I would certainly recommend looking into an Apple refurbished one.I have never been dissapointed with my Apple products. (I also own a mac mini).Very good investments in well designed and constructed electronic devices.
5	1386806400	Eight GB are all you need. Since the price has dropped and the fourth generation still isn't obsolete I would recommend this ipod to anyone who wants an ipod touch.
3	1386633600	The product itself was great! But, the accuracy of te item, not so much. I did not purchase a &#34;white&#34; iPod. I purchased 2 black, which I wrote great reviews on. This would be an Amazon error, the the company selling (I'd imagine). Again, the iPod itself was great-just wasn't white!
5	1386633600	This product was much better than I expected. The description said it had few noticeable scratches. This Ipod can be claimed as brand new, because it was in excellent condition. I would buy from this seller again, and recommend it to other people too.
5	1386547200	My grand daughter loved it and used it daily.  She dropped it and the front glass cover broke.  She still continued to use it.
5	1386547200	perfect, what he wanted workes great, well did untill he dropped it for the 10 th time and it broke for good
5	1386460800	My kid loves this thing and so do I.  It's held up with being taken everywhere....and I mean everywhere.  I totally recommend.
5	1386460800	it works great back gets a little smugi  but works fine it does not run  ios 7 so it was a bummer
4	1386374400	It locks up and i dropped the screen(which was my fault) but Overall I love it. I can play games on it and listen to music. When at home, i can get online. I love the facebook app.I ordered it on a tuesday evening and i got it Friday morning. The only problem was that it's easy to break. i tripped over a shoe laying in the hallway at 4am and dropped it. the top of the screen was cracked
5	1386374400	It is for my 7yr olIt is for my 7yr old and have had no problems with it so far.
5	1386374400	Works great for the cost Apple products last it seems forever. Still use it today even thou there are more recent products
3	1386115200	little disapointed it didnt come with a charger or head phones. It did however come with a case and stand.
5	1386028800	I've had my Ipodtouch 4th generation for over a year, It was my first....my first electronic like this anyways, I had a Ipod nano that I liked alot because it could play movies/music and came with games (very limited) but when I first got my Ipod touch I spent all week figuring it out and finding my favorite apps. Reading through the manual was love at first sight. I spent the first minute always keeping it on hand and even today that has not changed. The resolution isn't as good as my computer/laptop, mobile sites can be confusing at times, the apps are wonderful, camera isn't very good for taking far away pictures and its a bit slow at times but I love it and to this day It still can surprise me with hidden features. Good choice if you haven't had electronics like this but I wouldn't recommend it to someone that has had electronics with better quality because it would just be a let down.
5	1386028800	iPod looks and works like a brand new one.  Recieved one day later than promised but otherwise super product.  Would recommend to anyone.
5	1386028800	Purchased for my granddaughter and she loves it, doesn't go anywhere without it. Well worth the money to see the smiles.
5	1385942400	It is easy to carry and use. I am sorry to see the model has been discontinued. It is difficult to use sometimes as it keeps losing the program I am using.
4	1385856000	I bought this for my daughter at her request.  She used it a lot at first but then she got an ipad and she doesn't really use it now, but while she had it she used it a lot.
5	1385856000	LOVE THIS IPOD! I bought my Hubby the Apple iPod touch 8 GB 4th Gen. because he is a physician and through an Epocrates app it allows him to have a wealth of medical information at his finger tips. He has also become addicted to Free Cell so he uses it for fun as well!
3	1385769600	I love it! It's still working came with no scratches or anything...but after like 2 monthes the camera stops..but once in a while i cane use it still..WHATS UP WITH THAT? :P
4	1385769600	Nice features but the 8 gig was used up rapidly. The iOS 7 upgrade dumbed it down. Love the WiFi capability
5	1385683200	Excellent gift for kids.  They love it.  You can do anything with this except make cell phone calls.  And if you have wifi you can even make calls using that.
5	1385424000	Love it well worth it 10+ lil scratches no big deal doesnt effect the device im going to put a case on it good price for ipod 4 gen but wish it had charger
5	1385337600	got this with a square trade warranty haven't had a single problem with the ipod i still use it to this day and this was over a year ago
1	1385337600	Well now i know why it is discontinued....had all sorts of issues. internet connection, the screen cracked way easier than it should have, trouble running apps, ect
5	1385337600	The ipod came in perfect working condition, in fact I'm using it to type this review. I love it so much
5	1385337600	Works great, looks great. Very happy with this purchase. My son loves it. Making this purchase was a good decision.
5	1385337600	Still working after a lot of abuse.  Love apple products since they work so well together. This model is discontinued, but the itouch is perfect for kids who don't need a phone.  Honestly, my son has an ipad mini now so this doesn't get so much use anymore.
4	1385337600	All Apple products are well made.  What else can be said.  My son loves this Apple iPod Touch.  All good.
5	1385164800	Very good product!!Since I bought it never problems!!My Fiancee is using it almost every dayBattery lasts a lot
5	1385078400	Absolutely no problems at all. Does it's job well. Front and back camera, plays music, plays games and other apps. Might not be the mainstream generation but it's affordable and gets the job done.
5	1385078400	works great with our system, does have the older style connection but we knew that going in.  thanks for offering this.
5	1384732800	love it! came fast and undamaged. everything was in place. was stolen a few weeks later but enjoyed the most of it
5	1384732800	Great deal my daughter has wanted one for a long time and finally were able to get one. Unfortunately not enough memory
4	1384560000	it was exactly what i was looking for and i would recommend it to any one needing a great i pod touch
4	1384387200	Good quality and comes in handy when at the gym or on the run, excellent sound quality and headphones as well
4	1384387200	it is a great system!!!!!!! I love it!!!!!!! it sometimes has a hard time going home but that does not happen too often. it charges really well and fast. it once only took 20 minutes to be from full dead to fully charged. Now, I know that all these other versions that SEEM fancier but they actually are not. The 4th ipod has great games great apps and it is not slow. If you get this I really bet that you will be satisfied!!!!!!!!!! thanks for reading!!!!!!!  -anonymous
5	1384300800	I got this for my niece for her b-day. Im a huge fan of apple so not sure if my opinion counts.
5	1384300800	great item for my daughter...speedy service and good price...glad I got it when I could...thanks for making it available...Excelsior and exeunt!
5	1384300800	I am thrilled with my Apple iPod. I have wanted one forever and purchased this one for a great price. Now I can walk and listen to books on tape or music.
5	1384214400	Bought for my daughter. She uses it every single day and has never been disappointed. The price point was great!!
5	1384128000	Bought this as part of Thanksgiving deal. Amazon please bring that deal back!This iPod is still going strong even after going through all the iOS upgrades: 5, 6, 7. Performance hasn't degraded.Normal scratches are visible in the back on the chrome face but otherwise its a great product and hasnt malfunctioned at all.
5	1383868800	Still going strong after a couple of years. There really isn't any need to continually update electronics like this, so if it works, keep it.
5	1383868800	The product was what I ordered and in perfect condition, and works perfectly without any issues whatsoever. I love my product. :)
3	1383868800	Home button doesn't work  - didn't expect it to be perfect - Otherwise no complaints since it is discontinued model
5	1383782400	Love the Apple products and this one I use when I walk outside to music and also use the Nike fit program to check my miles.  Also play games while waiting at the doctors office.
5	1383782400	Fast shipping and great product. It is great to have, the screen is readable and it is not to heavy for when you go running.
5	1383782400	This STILL is the most amazing gadget our grandson has. I does everything...text, phone,musi games, it is awesome. Amazon when you tell me how many words I have to use to leave a review, I quit leaving reiews.
5	1383696000	In love with my Ipod! Got it a few months ago & it worked terrifically!!! I would buy another one another time :)
5	1383696000	My kid still has this 2+ years later. If you buy a case to protect it the ipod will last alot longer especially with kids dropping it. Great product
5	1383609600	I am using the iPod to submit this review. It it working perfectly. Looks like new and does the assigned tasks.
5	1383523200	Came in great shape -- My son says it does not hold a charge long - but that may be because he is on it so much already!
4	1383436800	I'm satisfied with the purchase. As you may know, buying outdated electronic device is risky. It doesn't support most of the newly developed apps due to the limitations of hardware. Anyway, it is good for regular use.
3	1383350400	It was good no headphone no charger an the camera don't work the battery is not good it's say 100 the 20 second later it's 15 percent
5	1383177600	you can do a lot of things with this, not only a mp3 player, i like it, is an easy way to entertain
5	1383091200	My daughter loved it! It looked new! No scratches or marks! Amazing! I bought another one too and am not regretful! Buy it!
3	1383091200	We had a little trouble with this device.  It still had someone else's data, contacts, etc on it when it arrived and we had to do some research to get it set up.  We paid a bit more as this was advertised as &#34;refurbished&#34; and we expected it to be ready to go.  After that hiccup it's been ok.
5	1383004800	easy and quick item arrived in perfect condidion and i am very pleased!!!!! i will have to reconsider doing reviews this is not worth doing i should be able to say that i am pleased and thats it.
4	1382918400	I really like my Ipod It does relax I am glad  8 got this one very easy to use glad I chose it
5	1382745600	When I ordered this j was skeptical at first because used electronics aren't always as it seems. I have had the iPod touch 4 brand new when it first came out and was very happy so I have certain standards, but I ordered it and paid a good price for it and ended up a very happy customer. It arrived on time and was in better condition than I thought it would be. Easy setup no problems at all with anything. I am very satisfied with it and wouldn't have any problems buying from this seller again.
5	1382486400	It worked great. Nothing was wrong with it and it was in really good condition. It was way better than buying a new one for more money.
5	1382486400	This was a suitable for my daughter as a first 'smart'electronic device for her age group.  But it was difficult to control content and that might be more for Apple Co. To address.
4	1382400000	i've been using my ipod touch for 2 and a half years... the overall performance is still good in shape! though it becomes a bit lagging lately but i think it's because i didn't update the iOS. i have a friend who has his ipod touch for close to... 5years and it's not performing well... i'm looking forward till that point and see how it goes. hopefully it won't be too bad? hahawith the price, it's not a bad choice to make.
5	1381968000	i like my ipod because it was a resonable price it works fine and is durable.I strongly recomend getting it
5	1381881600	Got this for a gift for a very special kid who makes me happy and proud every day of her life. She deserves this and lots more.
5	1381881600	I use all the time, very rugged, great double layered protection...an must have for outdoor or heavy use. Great IPOD!!
5	1381795200	Came early and exactly how it was described, thank you. It was in perfect condition, but the charger it came with was old. Nut still okay (:
4	1381708800	So the reason I bought another touch was because my old iPod died. But then, I got an iPhone upgrade so this was just completely useless. Yes, please indulge in my first world problem.Seriously though, iPods were the go-to tech item only a few years ago but I remember there were so many issues with mine. When it did work, it was awesome. The apps were great and there were countless useful features. When it didn't work, it wreaked havoc on my life. Examples:- Battery life is atrocious to the point where my iPod would die after 1 hour- Back scratches so easily. I had the iPod for a day without a case and there a million scratches in the back. I was extremely careful, placing it on my bed, but to no avail.- iPod randomly shuts down- Camera was nearly non-existent, unless blurry pictures are your thing
4	1381449600	The lock button broke about two years after I purchased it but other than that It was a nice product and served me well.
1	1381449600	Purchased this Ipod recently and has already gone to black screen. tried everything to fix it but nothing. Everything else is working as far as being able to hear music but with a black screen you can't control it or use apps. Learned my lesson on buying electronics from here
1	1381363200	It sucks. When I got it i found that the screen was taken off when sent. :-( I was pretty upset.
4	1381363200	Good qualityWorked for a yearNo scratchesSound button screwed up.Screen clearGood sound effectsWorth the money
5	1381363200	Was received timely.  I tested and found that it seems to be very good condition..  I  am also positive that my teenager will enjoy it.
1	1381363200	Apple Store broke my iPod while doing diagnostics and asked me then to buy replacement at $99 or kind enough to "give" me $10 discount on new one? - Not likely - Samsung, here I come - If it ain't iPhone, go to the back of the line
5	1381276800	These were perfect and came with a computer wire charger, but no manual. I had a relative explain a few things to me since I was more or less new to using an Apple product. The main problem is that when they get wet, there's no way to remove the battery and try to dry it out as much as possible. If Apple could work out that little bug, I'd buy more products.
4	1381276800	Item received in good condition, with prompt delivery. Why should I have to express my satisfaction or dissatisfaction in a minimum of words? Is this enough words,..or do I need to add more? We can always be redundant, if that's what you're looking for. Or are you looking for rave reviews? Shouldn't one set of ratings be enough, or do you feel more is better? Maybe if you explain why you need &#34;so much feedback&#34;,.. I might be able to give it more freely. Some of us have more things to do than to write a 500 word essay on why we like to order online, & what we like or dislike about the process. But one thing I dislike is when I &#34;have to&#34; or am &#34;required to&#34; type a response with a minimum of words, & for whatever reason lose the page before sending it, & or typing it all in, then have to do it all over again. Maybe the less you have to do, the more reviews you can type, or the more redundant you are able to be. I hope this meets your &#34;requirements&#34;!!!
4	1381276800	iPod is in great working order but no power cord and ear plugs. I bought this for 12 years old daughter for her birthday..
5	1381276800	No longer for sale, but it was an outstanding product.  The new touch is just as nice, but not as cheap :P  You can't really go wrong with anything apple!
5	1381190400	Product is as advertised, works flawlessly, battery holds a charge for even playing music through an 8 hour bike ride.
3	1381017600	The iPod works fine but the USB cord and headphones broke the very next day! So-so rating from this mom!
4	1380844800	My son really loved his. No need to buy the 5th generation. Loved face time and playing games on it and the camera. Helped me because he quit stealing my phone.  However, it breaks very easily.  I drop my Android phone all the time and it never breaks. He had his for 1 month and it shattered the glass and quit working. Repair shop said costs 100 dollars to fix it. I can buy another used one for that price, but not sure if an Android would be a better deal and more sturdy.
4	1380844800	I love my ipod, use it nearly every day to listen to my podcast during my commute. great quality too
5	1380758400	when i opened the box was not expecting the dr.dre beats that took me by surprise ipod is in awesome condition ty ty ty ty ty
1	1380672000	It had a broken screen.  I opened the package and saw that the screen was barely holding on and within secods, it just shattered into pieces.  I'd like to return it.  Can you please give me information on how to do that?
5	1380672000	I bought this for my granddaughter and she is loving it, loving it, loving it!!!!!!!!!!!! will definitely check back when I decide to get myself one!!
1	1380672000	Very dissatisfied with the IPod 4 generation. It was blocked and had someone else's information. I called contact person no one answered so left message. No one returned call! Had to pay to unblock the ipod. Also USB cable fell apart couple of days later.Should have bought Apple store refurbished items would have cheaper and also had warranty.
5	1380672000	Was very pleased with the product. Looked like new. Buffed out all scratches on back.Brand new screen, works great. Fast shipping was another plus. Would do business with them again.
5	1380672000	Fantastic piece of hardware. Slim, slick, light and fast. Alas! does not have a phone in it. Low cost to enjoy many apple store apps and games.
5	1380672000	Apple Ipod touch 8gb black....great product!  My son recently shattered the screen - because he threw it down!  going to see if i can get the screen replaced.
4	1380672000	For what I wanted for it works. It's ok it has cam and I can do face time with my family
5	1380240000	because i love this cover because the cover can pritect my sreen phone that why i choose this cover i love it
5	1380153600	I have owned this product (Ipod Touch 4G), since December of 2010. This device has lasted throughout use and abuse. It has suffered numerous drops and has been able to play the most graphically intense IOS games available. It has served me well throughout the past few years. I have loved this device but it is time to upgrade since it is slowly becoming obsolete due to IOS 7 and the new Ipod touch 5G. I will soon be getting an Iphone 5S due to the fact this was my first apple product and have been VERY impressed and pleased with my purchase. I still believe even though it is outdated now, it looks better than the new Ipod touch 5G but i don't recommend buying this generation due to the fact you will be spending almost $200 on an outdated version. I have owned tablets and 2 android phones and i feel like IOS is such a more "polished" and refined operating system. The only flaw's i have observed with this device is how extremely easy it is to scratch the polished aluminum back cover, the battery life, and the grainy video. I was never expecting a huge battery life, but this one's is extremely short. The camera is VERY decent in good lighting but in low light situations is bad. The video is grainy and the sound quality is not amazing, but it's not an Iphone either.. Other than that, it has been an AMAZING device. Once again, DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT IOS 7.
5	1379980800	Love it ! I can Facetime my son and c my grand daughter from LA ! I can check the weather and my E mails from it !
5	1379894400	it was exactly what is wanted but it does not update to ios 7 and the iphone 4 is exactly the same thing but it can update. that's because the iphone 4 has 512mb and the ipod touch 4th gen only has 256mb of ram so it would lag so bad if it could update.  I think i am going to get a iphone 4 or 4s. or maybe a samsung galaxy s4. it is a good budget but still good ios device. i would recommend this to someone on a low budget and wants a apple product.
5	1379894400	gave this to my son he loves it plays it all the time never has had any problem with so far
1	1379894400	You cannot FaceTime with people who have iOS7 systems when you have a iPOD Touch 4th gen.  Buyer beware.  This product has become obsolete.
5	1379894400	This product met every expectation I had and was delivered just as said, on time, in proper packaging and in awesome shape. Could not be happier with what I received.
5	1379635200	i absolutely love it and haven't had any problems from it yet!!! i think everyone should try this if you're low on money :D
4	1379376000	Apple is the best, it works great, its the 2nd one I've had broke 1st one. drive a truck so I use it everyday
5	1379376000	I needed a simple device for my small children to have facetime with their dad who lives out of state.  This was a perfect solution and I am very happy with it.
5	1379289600	This was a gift to my grandson last Christmas. He loves it and it has worked very well for him.
1	1379289600	Sucks needs iOS 7 like a boss a Siri and lightning charger for drizzle rizzle my nizzle old iPod sucks
4	1379289600	it's pretty good but there's not much space.I would suggest u buy a 16gb or larger. this one does not hold much
5	1379289600	Bought this as a gift for my grandson.  It was &#34;Love At First Sight&#34;, something all teenagers crave for.  This is a status symbol that tells his peers &#34;I have arrived!&#34;  The first thing he did was go out and purchase a protective case for it.  The gel case provided gives little protection to the iPod when in the hands of a teenager.
2	1379116800	I misplaced my iPod and thought it might've been stolen. Before the item even arrived I filed an order return bc I found my iPod. I received an email from this seller stating that I would receive a "FULL refund minus the price of shipping". After they got it they could only refund me $10 less than what I paid bc since 2 weeks they said the "value has dropped significantly". I never even opened the package!!! Not even the shipping pack. Only thing I did was switch the label and ship it back!!! Do NOT order ANYTHING from "New Video News" bc they have bad customer service. I should have received the FULL refund for what I PAID not what everyone else is paying for the item now. S&H was $20 and they charged me this new "restocking fee" bc the "value dropped"? What a load of crap!!! So technichally out of $98(tax included) I only got $60 of my money back. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!
5	1379030400	I bought this ipod for my boyfriend for his birthday & he lovesss it , he dnn go nowhere without it !!
3	1379030400	the i pod i recived is slow&#62; like there is a virus on it from the day i got its been running really slow. like a delayed lock sound and it freezes up every now and then other than that the ipod is great
4	1378771200	Product came in before estimated arrival date. Was very clean without any scratches. However it doesnt have the apple symbol on the back like most apple products do. When ordering it, it stated the back would not be replaced so not sure on why it would be located somewhere on the device. But overall great product. My 8 year old loves it.
1	1378598400	It is a piece of junk!!!!!Does not work can't down load games or music!!! I have nothing good to say about this worthless piece of junk!!!!!
5	1378425600	This ipod is in great condition, super fast shipping. Was a great price. Works like new. Will make the perfect Christmas present for my son!
5	1378425600	GREAT item! I have had this for 3 years now & will purchase another one if something happens to this one..in fact I DID purchased another one as a gift! Lots of fun! Great entrainment! Easy to use!
5	1378339200	Bought from EZCORP for only 80$ and it arrived in good time and included a warranty from defects all in all it was a good deal.
3	1378339200	We purchased the Ipod and it was shipped great.  We could not use it due to some portions of the touch screen not working with letters to type.  Returned it for a full refund.  The company was wonderful and worked with us to get this taken care of.  I would use them again due to their customer service and quick refund.
1	1378339200	Ordered new I-pod . The one I received was not new, Had no charger or other components . Just not as advertised very disappointed.
5	1378339200	A good ipod touch. No problems, been happy with it. It was in good condition as stated. A good buy.
2	1378252800	The item itself would be amazing if the battery didnt stop working. I cannot charge it, or even turn it on. I was very unsatisfied.
1	1378166400	So this is the second iPod 4g I have bought from electronic Florida and both have problems. The first I bought just stopped working around the 60 day warranty. They refused to even look at it and I am sending the second back as it shuts off for no reason and has no battery life. You get what you pay for....
4	1378080000	I brought this one as a replacement and it worked like a brand new one out of the box. should have bought two for the price.
5	1378080000	Perfect! Same as the picture, very recomended. The quality is good; I bought it a year ago and havent had any problem!
5	1377993600	I give this product 5 stars because it is still in very good working condition! What I like about it is all functions work perfectly! The only thing I didn't like is the battery drains a little faster than normal when I'm online I recommend this product to anyone who don't have a lot of money to spend on a new ipod touch. The seller seems to take good care of her items.
5	1377907200	We were pleased with the ipod, it looks perfect and works great. My granddaughter had one and dropped it too many times and it could no longer be repaired, so this was a great find. The shipping was quick also. Now the button has stuck but she still can use it and is very pleased and that's what matters. So thank you and keep up the good work... d senior
5	1377820800	We jumped into the digital world with our child's first IPod purchase. We were reluctant to pay full price new, so we went with this. We are so happy we did. My child loves it.
4	1377734400	This product is great.  It helped the kids learn ABC, improved eye-hand coordination, and talked to distant relatives via video phone apps.
4	1377734400	My son used this to store his music. He can text other iPod or iPhone or iPad users with this device.
5	1377648000	I love this!! The price was good. And the ipod still works amazing.A great great great buy for sure
5	1377475200	I absolutely &lt;3 this device. This is my 2nd device (8gb) coming in a week or so. My first (32gb) one burnt up after about a year using it, but I think I had it too close to my laptop that produces too much heat. I definitely suggest plugging into a surge protector instead of just wall or connecting to laptop longer than a few hours. I have a Kindle Fire, an iRulu (Android tablet), and my dad has the Nook. I had many videos, free books, pictures, and apps. I went absolutely nuts since it burnt up 3 months ago. I saved up $50 worth of giftcards ($10 from Plink & $40 from Swagbucks) and paid $15 out of pocket for this device $60 + $5 s&h.; It has a dual cameras that is easy to use and is clearer compared to my iRulu's grainy dual cameras. Kindle Fire does not have a camera. The iPod Touch 4 is extremely fast compared to my other tablets. I will be saving giftcards again for an iPad 2 since it has a bigger screen to read magazines on and can update to iOS 7. I LOVE how I can put the iPod Touch 4 in my pocket. I have bought a Gameboy soft case for it and have gotten many compliments! I played Mino Monsters all the time. Definitely backup everything because in my case I will have to restart Mino Monsters from scratch especially when I had beat everything. They have added new Fire Lord and Spirit since my device went out of commission.To add SD card, USB, A/V out go here--->Camera Connection Adapter MicroSD ReaderIf you want HDMI, go here--->SANOXY%C2%AE Adapter Camera Connection iPhone
5	1377129600	it works great and no cracks on it to so if you are thinging of geting one get one today
5	1377129600	Apple makes great products. They are functional, user-friendly and elegant. What's not to like? Even used, they still retain value. With 8 gigs of memory, this iPod will hold a lot of songs, videos, games, apps, etc.
5	1377043200	I purchased this on a whim to use primarily as a music storage device and was extremely pleased with its performance. Very portable and easy to use, no problems setting it up. I only wish it came with glue or maybe a thick rope so as to attach it to myself somehow. I had it for two weeks and then drunkenly lost it on the highway, I probably peed on it. Replaced it with the iPhone 4S, cheers.
5	1376870400	I bought this for my 2 year old because it's cheaper than buying some of the other products out there for the kids to learn with & has good battery life. Rather than spend a lot of money on different learning disc/apps that your child will grow out of, I find different learning apps in the apple store that are free & can grow with her as she grows. She loves it.
4	1376784000	It was very frustrating at first to get connected to iTunes with my computer, I had to have my son help. I am older generation but not so old that I didn't use the first computers that came out and am still using them as well as other electronic &#34;toys&#34;. Over all once we got it going with that, I found that there are things I really like however the free app games I have, I already play on FB and can't get connected with it to play the levels I'm already on. They started me on 1. That's ok as it's not that big of a deal either way, but would like to be able to play against my friends still.
5	1376784000	I love it because it has a lot of cool features on it Like: checking e-mails  Download music  Download Apps and other cool stuff with that said
1	1376784000	spots in the screen shows up a day after warranty was up! So I was not satisfied with my purchase from this seller at all.
5	1376784000	This is a great team, has arrived on time and very fast.Although there are other more updated, this team is a great classic: I recorded about 1200 songs .. and is the best.is very effective, and does very good work, the super stack yields
5	1376611200	Plays music! Takes pictures!That is all I wanted and this delivers.This has also really helped me with school because of the camera.
5	1376611200	This is a great ipod. I love the white color and the camera and all the features are great as well!
5	1376611200	My daughter is very happy. She can't live without it. We are very happy with the quality of the Ipod. It works great and it's fast to pick up internet.It also takes great pictures.
5	1376611200	This is a wonderful unit, easy to operate, and works as expected. There is nothing more to say Apple rocks!
5	1376524800	I bought this solely to use this for iPhone development, and frankly, there's no need to buy an iPhone for development. If your child wants to go into development give an iPod Touch, and don't waste your money.
5	1376438400	Excellent condition and great, great buy for your money! I recommend this to any interested in a used ipod!! If your looking for something used this is the buy for you!
5	1376352000	Hello me nice idid give my second son love it if happened let u know ipod touch good my second so worry ipod touch the better
5	1376265600	This IPod shipped very fast and it came it perfect condition!! i am just typing more so i can put this review up, by the way perfect product!!!!!!!!!
5	1376265600	It is what all apple products are in my eyes. Almost flawless. I know this is an older iPod but we still enjoy it to this day
5	1376179200	Got this as a xmas gift for my neighbors daughter. She loves it and of course its made by apple so its a quality product
5	1376006400	Great product. I should have bought a 32GB version as OS and Apps tend to eat through storage space rather quickly. The display colors and processor speed are great. Wi-Fi support is flawless. Buying a silicon protective case and a screen protector is definitely a good idea.
5	1375833600	THIS ITEM WAS JUST AS THE SELLER DESCRIBED!! IT FREEZES HERE AND THERE, SOMETIMES SLOW BUT I GUESS THATS WHY ITS DISCONTINUED.. OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS JUST GREAT.
4	1375833600	well it did not come on time exactly, but I still got it within a reasonable time, also I have a little blame on my side because I put in the wrong address but other than that I liked it. Also the device itself was exactly what the description said on there page. I plan on shopping here again.Oh "p.s." it took me a while to get the thing open, which is great, nice to know they keep their stuff safe & secure!
5	1375747200	so far really good I just had a chance to use it on a trip to Uxbridge Ont Canada Thanx
4	1375488000	it was just what I need. work great. Deliver in time for the price was just right not complains it works for me.
5	1375401600	My iPod touch came early!  it works perfectly.  it came brand new with no scratches or nicks, and it was still in the box, complete with earphones and charger!
5	1375401600	What more can I say the rating speaks fori it's self greeeeeeeat product I would recommend this to everyone I know
5	1375401600	This was one of the smartest and best purchases I have ever made. I have always bought my iPods brand new and this was the first used one I have decided to purchase. I did a ton of comparing and this was the seller I chose due to approval from other customers and product review. I would gladly recommend this seller to friends and family and order another product with assurance. GREAT ITEM AND FAST SHIPPING!!!
5	1375315200	What can I say... I really enjoy my IPOD touch. It has enough capacity for my needs (although if you want a ton of apps and music I would recommend a 16GB version). I love that it can connect to WiFi and stream music and video, too.
5	1375228800	I love this. I use it most everyday. Have not had a single problem with it. Other than i would consider buying one with more memory.
2	1375142400	The one that I received was not what I was expecting I looking for a little bit more updated one but when I got it the home button stuck and so I had to turn on assistive touch which got in the way a lot
5	1375056000	Gave this to my granddaughter she loves it!  But for me----it takes to much of her time away from me'!!!!!!!!!
5	1375056000	Perfect gift for my 6 year old, i didn't want to spend the money for a brand new one as this is her first major device, all others have been kid friendly products like vtech etc. But she has two older siblings and begged for this. It's awesome, can't even tell it's it was previously used. Perfect Perfect for first time users.
5	1375056000	I have had this iPod for ever now and it's still going strong! It holds quite a bit of music and was a great buy!
5	1374883200	An the receiver uses it daily... wish I had brought one for myself too, but oh well hindsight is 20/20.
5	1374796800	I liked this product very much, the ipod is the same condition as described, the quality of the touch is very good, thanks!
5	1374796800	My daughter uses this and we have a hard time getting her to put it down. If it were anything else it would be worn out. Apple has great products that are very user friendly.
5	1374624000	I ordered this for my boyfriend's 12 year old daughter.  I went with the used 4th gen instead of a brand new one because from what I saw, this older model did everything we were looking for.  We added music, downloaded a texting app, and she can download the games that she wants.  I ordered a used one, but it's still in great condition.  Great buy!
4	1374537600	I just love this Ipod. The whole family uses this for music, games, and movies. We will soon be getting another.
3	1374192000	I was looking for an iPod 8GB (4th) for my son, as his sister already had one. After looking at inventory, reading reviews, shipping methods, extras provided (charger, etc...), and customer satisfaction with this supplier (forget their name) I chose to buy it. It arrived in a timely manner, but was by far not &#34;excellent&#34; as indicated in the review. It was pretty scratched up and had a small crack (chip) on the left side of the screen. Rather than returning (because timing for son's birthday) we set it up and gave it to him. He proceeded to crack the screen completely in less than a week...boys will be boys. In summary &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; I'll definitely buy new next time of give myself a few more weeks to make sure a &#34;like new - refurbished&#34; or what ever it was called is as stated.
5	1374192000	I love this ipod touch. Some people say it was not a good decision to buy it, but it was, because i love it.
5	1374105600	My kids take it everywhere, we have 2 kids so we needed a second iPod, the price point and the description were exactly as mentioned, very pleased.
5	1374019200	I'm not a tech savvy person. However, for someone not familiar with technology, I expect the product to be &#34;easy-to-use&#34; at the least.I'm already impressed because of the following:- Clean picture- Camera on back and front- Able to face time- I get to the apps I need with ease and no crashes- A lot of room still after I transferred my music (About 400+ songs) and pictures (1,500+) from the desktop.-
5	1374019200	my granddaughter loves this had been after me for  long time to buy one so was lucky I found this one at a price I could afford
5	1373932800	Bought this item for my young brother and now he lives on this thing, great item and great price. He surfs the web at night and plays all his games.
5	1373760000	Extremely pleased with this purchase. I have had so much fun with my iPod, it's awesome! I'm addicted to apps and love playing games like Candy Crush, Angry Birds, etc. I highly recommend this if you want to add alittle fun to your life. Portable enjoyment!
2	1373587200	It will not stay charged, when playing music it will only last a hour or so game shorter. Mothers day gift gone bad!
1	1373587200	I was not happy I returned it and still have not got my money back what do I do now am I just out 149.00 or what
3	1373500800	This came as a 2nd generation instead of a 4th generation. But I was reimbursed when I returned it and the seller contacted me to make sure I was satisfied.
3	1373328000	it did not come with a charger other wise it was great after buying charger could have bought new one bad deal id have to say
5	1373241600	was just what i wanted as a gift for my son was in as good a shape as i anticipated
3	1373241600	it was ok but I found cracks and scratches inn the front but in all it's all perfect and awesome I love it
5	1373155200	Came in great condition. It had no scratches on it, and it came with an unexpected screen cover. Battery lasts a while, and the itouch is easy to use. Thanks!
1	1373155200	My son used his Christmas money and we blight this only to have itjust quit working 4 months after he got it.  So I went to best buy and got one at least ar have a warranty now.  What a waste of money.
5	1373068800	We were looking for this particular iPod in a large amount and luckily we were able to find it on Amazon's website with ease.
5	1372896000	I ordered this Ipod for my daughter, and so far it has been the perfect gift! The seller shipped it out extremely quickly, and it arrived in perfect condition! I am extremely satisfied with this purchase, and my daughter is so happy with it as well! Everything was reset to factory settings, so it was like getting a brand new Ipod touch!
3	1372809600	it was in good condition as promised the camera is a little weak but all in all cant beat the savings
5	1372809600	We got this iPod for our six year old son after the one we got on eBay overheated and stopped working!! Sure wish we would have found this deal first!! The iPod works great, shipping was fast and we couldn't be happier!!
5	1372636800	Worked brand new everyday, took it every where I went!! Still working like new til this day! I recomend this product to everyone.
2	1372550400	When I received my iPod I opened it up and it wouldn't turn on. I looked at the inside and noticed there were several screws missing and the inside was destroyed. Not very good if you ask me.
5	1372377600	As much as garbage as I talk about Apple products (just not trendy or refined enough to appreciate them, I guess), I absolutely love the iPod products. I've had several and every one of them has far exceeded my expectations with regard to reliability, even after abuse.I have yet to have a problem with these that didn't have a discreet and obvious explanation (like leaving in the Alabama sun for hours). Even that one still works a little.
5	1372118400	My daughter asked for this for her birthday. We got it for her, and she used it constantly. My only complaint was that she dropped it and cracked the screen. We were able to get it fixed and we bought a case for it. We've had no problems since then.
5	1372032000	I got it a day sooner than they told me :)The Ipod looks brand new and is working great so far and he battery has no problems :)
5	1372032000	I bought this for my sister about 2 years ago. I got this for her when she went to Asia. When I lived there, my iPod was a heaven send with all of the mandarin translation tools that they offer and wanted my sister to have the same great experience. She loved it and it was very durable. It took her a full 1 1/2 years to break it (and if you know her, that is actually a record). This is definitely recommended!
5	1372032000	I have never had a problem with this device.  My daughter uses it responsibly.  Get a good case to protect it.  Oh, some iPhone earphones (the high quality ones) may not fit properly as the jack is at an angle (makes no sense) and the iPhone jack is square.
5	1371772800	Ordered this for our daughter since hers was broken.  This was just what we were looking for in a replacement.  Price was great and it was in great condition.  Also if we didn't like it we had seven days to send it back.  Shipping was fast.  Thanks
5	1371686400	My now 12yrs old daughter has been begging to get this item for a very long time.  She was finally able to buy it after her 12th birthday.  She loves this thing.  I have to make her put it away so she can eat and go outside and get some fresh air.  After enabling the parental blocks, she has download games and apps and taken numerous useless pictures of herself and our pets.  I play on it too after she goes to sleep (with her permission of course lol).  She bought it refurbished, so it was relatively cheap.  The only down fall is that you can't load music on it like an mp3 player (without a fee), which kind of defeats the purpose of buying it - it is supposed to play music (someone please let me know if there is a way to do this).  After spending so much money on the ipod touch, I don't see how Apple can force customers to then pay to upload your own music to the device from cds you already have at home or buy iTunes.  But other than that the Ipod touch has a lot of great functions.  I'm considering buying the 5th generation one for myself when Apple stops hiding money from the government.  I guess that will be awhile. LOL
5	1371600000	The white ipod looks amazing. my brother has had an ipod for two years and had no problems, so i figured i should get one too. it is a lot of fun and worth the money
4	1371600000	Meets all my expectations ... I enjoy having it, easy to use and nice piece to own.  Too bad it is discontinued.
3	1371427200	So pretty! Make sure not to drop it too much, it's really slippery & fragile as are most itouch/iphones.It came nicely wrapped in a bubble wrap
5	1371340800	what can you say?  everybody loves these.  still going strong after a long time.  its an ipod touch.  first one(third generation) got soaked in powerade to ruin it.
5	1371340800	Great condition.  Was exactly as promised. The description stated it was like new with no scratches and it was perfect!  My 8 year old daughter loves and thinks it's new!
4	1371340800	The IPod Touch I purchased works very well and is actually more than I expected. We took it of our trip to Greece and found the ability to talk to people back in the US through its video capability was really fun to be able to share where we were with our friends. The seller delivered on time and double checked it to make sure it was in working order. He found the battery to be substandard and replaced it before shipping. The seller had already replaced to screen and sent along a protector and USB cord as part of the deal.
5	1371340800	im surprised to find such a low price for a GOOD condition ipod touch not a acceptable where it kinda looks too used the seller was great there definitely great people to offer such an item in good condish at such low prices thanks! WOODSTOCK
1	1371254400	The iPod was ok but they said it doesn't have scratches and scuffles but when I saw It there was scratches everywhere and there was a sticker on the back ._. And the ear phones aren't even working so I think there effort is Very poor! If I was you don't order it from them
1	1370995200	please ensure the Gb size beforehand to avoid the disappointmentWill. Have to buy the 16GB soon and dell the other
5	1370995200	Great unit - it's still going strong - was handed down to my youngest child from the oldest.I wish we had another one for just music.
4	1370995200	Overall the ipod has been great for app use and music playing. The slim design is nice, screen works well, and iOS is pretty good. I do wish it had more multi-task ease like newer versions of Android, and more customizing ability of HTC Sense, and it looks like Apple is finally going that direction with the next gen of iOS. It's a good solid quality piece and the software works fairly consistently with minimal force closing. It's fairly fast to load, within current expectations, graphic quality is pretty good, and screen backlight is fairly warm which makes for less eye fatigue, if only colors that are more accurate too. Sound quality is ok, though I could wish for more custom control of the EQ as well for music. In general, the hardware is high quality and the software is good for what it is, despite niggles here and there with iOS and apple or iStore protocols. It is simple and easy to use for the most part. The stainless back gives a solid feel, but don't hold it over the toilet, it is slippery which can be annoying.
4	1370908800	Was in great shape and my son was very pleased!!!  A good value for a 13yr old saving his money.
2	1370822400	Bought this for my teenage grandaughter,and according to her it only worked well for a few months.Glad they discontinued it.
5	1370736000	After about 2 years of daily use, my iPod is still full of life in terms of storage capacity, battery life, and overall functionality. I never experienced any problems with it, so I'd buy a new one in a second as soon as this one comes to an end.
5	1370563200	Bought this after reading the reviews and love it. Does everything you need. has 2 cameras that I use with Skype application to talk to my friends and family when I am not around the computer.
5	1370476800	This was for my grandson.  He love it and used it quite a bit.  It has great features others may not have.
1	1370390400	THis was not the generation 4 ipod, it was the 3rd generation. I dont know why would they lie like that so I had to go head and give it to my daughter cause another wouldnt be back in time for her birthday.
3	1370390400	The iPod works well, but the battery is slow to charge (even using a quick charger) and does not hold the charge for long at all.  For instance, a 30% charge battery will be totally drained by being on stand-by  overnight.
4	1370390400	Kids love it. They spend a lot of time with it. They watch a lot of Dr. Who etc on it. Netflix etc. plus games, text each other.
5	1370304000	Turns out buying a used one is cheaper than replacing a cracked screen.  This one arrived very quickly and has worked very well.  No issues at all.  Great for a 10 year old.
3	1370304000	it doesn't work really good or stay charged that long but i ok i guess. i just had thoseclittle minor problems
5	1370131200	This item is great orderd it last month and awsome looked brand new never had any trouble with ... i order off this site every vchance i get never once complained bout there items ..
5	1369958400	I think these are the best IPODs available because they are so versatile and store a lot as well.  Apple came up with a great one on this device and with WIFI available, you can text with it too!
1	1369872000	So i recived this &#34;item&#34; today and it was the wrong ipod ! this just killed my whole mood. I hope they will send me the CORRECT ONE this TIME.
4	1369872000	Bought for my son he has never had a ipod, so he loves it. It keeps him busy, and off of my phone. I didn't realize how much it does.
5	1369785600	well since my daughter got it i see less of her she does every thing with it. so i guess it was made just for her. love it.
2	1369699200	Broke less than 6 months after I bought it new. The home button got stuck and made the iPod unusable. I expected better from an Apple product.
5	1369699200	The ipod works prefectly, just like new. My neice could not tell that it was used.  She loves it. Thank you.
5	1369612800	Ordered for my 12 yr old daughter. Only wanted the 8 GB b/c that is what her older brother has. Did not want the competition of mine is better than yours scenario. Found this iPod touch 8 GB and ordered it and received it before scheduled arrival date. B/c my two kids have the same iPod touch (one white & one black) they will spend hours sitting side by side messing around with their iPods. Only arguing now is which on looks better the white or the black. Lol.
5	1369612800	I gave it five out of five for it arrived a week after shipping so that was pretty quick considering where I'm at. It was exactly like described so that's always a plus. The price wasn't that bad for the item, condition and gen of Ipod. I would definitely recommend this seller to others. I was thrown off by the name but overall I'm pretty satisfied by the service and quality.
5	1369612800	I still use this thing to this day, really great iPod touch. Very durable and reliable and it last a long time battery life wise.
4	1369526400	I bought this for my 12 year old sister and she loves this. There are so many apps to chose from and she filled the entire thing with games. More games than music actually. She's had it for a year and it is lagging more frequently. She deleted 90% of her apps but no luck, it is still lagging. I also recommend getting a screen protector because it tends to get small scratches here and there, especially on the back!
4	1369353600	Bought it 4 my kid 4 Christmas  It is what it is  Its an Apple so it does what its suppose 2 do
5	1369267200	bought for grandson for christmas and he is loving it.  plays with it every day and uses it when wifi is around to call mom and dad.  Everything it said it was.  thanks
5	1369008000	It came on time and was purchased for a childs birthday gift. It ended up arriving the day of the party which was awesome! Procuct was said to be in very good condition!!! It was better than very good! It looked  brand new! Very pleased with the product.
5	1368921600	I bought this as a Christmas gift a few years ago...It came well pacakged...At the time it was the newest on the market...
5	1368835200	I love my IPOD Touch! I waited so long to purchase this product and now that I finally have it, I can kick myself for waiting so long! Great product!
5	1368662400	I made an attempt to repair my god-daughter's ipod touch 4. What a mistake! You need itty-bitty hands to fix these things. This item was by far the least expensive, worked perfectly and maintained my image of the magical fix-it man to an impressionable little girl. What more could you want from life.
3	1368662400	had thought the item also came with a charger as well as headphonees it arrived with neither product was in good condition but felr as if it was inaccuretly decribed.
5	1368576000	I am so happy with this buy. Perfect. Absolutely. Great price. Functions perfectly and comes with the warrenty. I love this baby and i would buy again!
5	1368403200	The product came practically next day and was very well protected! It helped me save a lot of money vs buying one from Apple.
5	1368403200	fully functional with intact battery.  Jaklbroken would have been noice, as tnewer software can run on these nicely.  Overall good
5	1368403200	What can I say? It's PERFECT! It's design is AWESOME, is slim, low weight, and it's beautiful. It has worked perfectly and I don't have any complain about it... I would buy it on 64GB...:)
4	1368230400	It was everything I was looking for. It works great. I will get another one when this one quits. If it ever does.
5	1368230400	REALLY THE IPOD TOUCH IS IN MY HANDBAG ALWAYS . I WORK A LOT WITH IT .I LOVE AL PRODUCTS  APPLE
5	1368144000	Very happy to have an ipod for my son again. This product came in great working condition. I wasn't fully cleaned out and restored. The previous owners information was still on it included aps and songs but we cleaned it all out.
4	1368144000	It's way too thin and the power button broke within 3 days, but I have no other problem with it
4	1368057600	This was a great iPod but being older it is a lot slower than the new ones. This is great for a child or someone who really doesn't care about speed.
5	1368057600	I bought this refurbished iPod along with Belkin's Tunecast RM Transmitter.  Hardly a scratch on the back side and the screen is free on any imperfections.  A great combo for a great price.
5	1368057600	I bought it for my wife and she loves it because it does everything.  She kinda wants another one but we cant afford it
4	1368057600	What you can say about IPod.... Well Ipod is definitely the best music player out there. What i dont like is the picture camera, so low resolution  I just  thought it could be better and for some reason sometimes It iwill stop when playing songs and I have to start over the songs. But well , Ipod is Ipod.
5	1367884800	I still use this device with iOS 6 jailbroken...works great and does everything you would want short of being a phone.
5	1367798400	This was a birthday gift for the granddaughter. She is extremely happy with the IPod  and said she would choose this item for a birthday present again.
5	1367798400	I love my old model iPod touch, it does the same thing that the new generations do, and it is just as great as the iPhone, only difference is siri and you can download something just like her!
4	1367712000	I like the Ipod but wish I could navigate all it's functions more easily.  Takes a lot of studying and knowledge to operate but then it has lots of functions.  Nice to be able to get on-line with it and also read my email while sitting in the Dr's waiting room.  I listen to audiobooks a lot on it.
5	1367539200	i have bought a lot of refurbished ones before and this one is by far the best one yet. i would recommend it
1	1367366400	Bought this for our granddaughter in august or september for a christmas gift for our granddaughter when she went to use it on christmas it blew up....contacted the seller and he said it was past the date to return it.....so i spent $175.00 and she had to throw it away.........Merry Christmas to a ten year old..........
3	1367280000	idk how to change my first review. so ipod wasnt as expected, more scratches and dings than i thought there would be but over all function is perfect.
5	1367193600	Works great. Bought it to use as my new CC machine with Square Up.Getting rid of the old merchant machine and all those extra fees.
5	1367193600	I absolutely love my iPod.  I hated the fact of how much money I spent on something that holds music, but I guess I've learned to love it.  I'm always on it, whether its for some apps or the music.  It's worth it if you don't have a andriod or iphone to hold music.  But there's no point in buying this if you have a phone that can hold your songs
5	1367107200	I got this for the music, now use it for so much more. I love my touch. I wish I would have gotten one sooner.
5	1367107200	I bought this iPod for my 11 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it! It was in great condition and came just as described. We hardly noticed the minor scratches and it works great! We are very satisfied with product. I've never owned an apple product before so I didn't know what to expect. Needless to say, my daughter is happy so am I!
5	1367020800	My granddaughter absolutely loves her i pod. It was late arriving because it was sent to the wrong address, but after the post office caught up, I received it in good order
3	1366934400	Some people love it but a believe that it is a ordinary equipment maybe the newest model give me more quality
5	1366761600	I had absolutely no problems, it updates, and its a great electronic to have. I even got my mother addicted to it. For it to be refurbished it was perfect. It looks and works like its brand new.
5	1366675200	I brought this phone my sis and boy I tell u its clue at her hip and in her face and boy I tell you for the price I feel like a winner
5	1366675200	Great price & product all packaged up from store.  works like a charm, needed it for dance recital music practice as well as school concerts music (downloaded teachers cd to it)
5	1366588800	this guy is soo awesome. his product is high quality and good. i recommend him to anyone and  to everyone!
5	1366243200	bought this for my daughter for Christmas..She Loves this..This item is very attractive in white. would highly recommend for anyone who has teenagers...As for adult for me the screen is too small for me
4	1366156800	At first, I thought that the iPod should have been cleaned up a little better.  But, after giving it to my daughter and hearing her praise how much she loved it, I was pleased with the purchase.
5	1365724800	Very satisfied with the product. My daughter loves her IPod touch! She is constantly on it as all teens are.
1	1365638400	DONT BYE THISthe screen broke within 2 weeks, literally just took it out of my pocket and screen cracked.
5	1365465600	he loves it, he always listening to it on the road, wether its on the way to walmart or just to walk around the block with my little sister.
4	1365292800	This product is juist as good as the new one of course minus the newer features.  But other than that it is a great product and is cheaper than the newer version.
4	1365120000	As expected from Apple. The quality of the hardware and software are well-built. It syncs seamlessly with my old MacBook. Glad to see that Apple continues to make backward-compatible products.
1	1365033600	i  ordered this  item early  february and  its  april it  never  showed  this  sellers  a  rip off. i  hope  to get  my  money  back  then  ill  right a good review
5	1364774400	This ipod is look like new and there is no scratch or nothings on the screen and it work great just like new.
5	1364774400	Siempre apple brindando la mejor tecnologia del mundo. Lo llevo a todas partes y es super practico, full recomendado a todos
5	1364688000	A great product, an IPhone without the phone. Loved it as soon as I got it. But get the 5th Generation, even better.
4	1364601600	I received fast shipping and signature required for the product. There are a few things wrong with the product, such as the bottom of the screen flickers ,and the camera is scratched and it is blurry. Overall it is a great IPod at a fair price and I thank you very much for it.
1	1364515200	This ipod lasted me maybe 3 weeks. The screen cracked a lil and this cause the entire ipod to go white or blue. I was disappointed and I will not be ordering from the seller again because they didnt want to assist me in getting a replacement.
5	1364428800	I like this i pod, i have not get any problem, and it works perfectly, besides it looked like new when i bought and still does.
5	1364428800	bought this last year. now it is on 6.1.2 jailbroken with virtually no problems. i use it as a phone, a network analyzer. i watch movies through netflix, music through grooveshark, and much more. better then iphones i think.
5	1364428800	Worked great, was a great price. Saved $ buying it on amazon vs in a store. My now 5 year old loves playing with it. We have had it over a year now-and had NO trouble with it! :)
3	1364428800	I have purchased 3 ipod touches from amazon and the battery life gets worse with each one.Also the price keeps going up.  Amazon is going down hill fast.
5	1364256000	Was nervous to order a refurbished product, due to the old saying you get what you pay for.But this item is like new, and we are very happy with it. and it shipped so fast.. we got it in time to surprise daughterfor a trip
4	1364169600	The front screen is very good lookingThe product was exactly as described.Only problem I am having is the touch screen sometimes stops. I can swipe to unlock and it wont catch the full swipe so I'll have to do it several times. I'll have to click on icons several times. But its not unliveable. Good for the price.
3	1364169600	I select that raking, because the Ipod It's ok, but the screen got a little crack.I like the ipod, and the cover. I dislike the crack.Thanks anyway, I like my new ipod touch.
3	1364169600	My son and daughter went in together, combining their money, to purchase this and it has held up for the last two months. The only issue is part of the screen will not work when touched.  I know it is advertised as being a new screen, so you would think it would all work just fine. My son never said anything because he didn't want me to send it back so he is just dealing with it.  I will be more careful next time in checking it out first.
3	1364169600	One of the down falls to purchasing a product before you have held it in your hand is knowing what my version of wear and tear, vs. say the sellers version of wear and tear.The Ipod description did say it was scratched. But upon receiving the item it was more than just normal wear and tear. Someone at some point purposely scratched it repeatedly in the same motion with sharp object. It did NOT effect the performance of the Ipod, however I did have to drop more money on a cover so that Christmas morning wasn't a big bust.Thank you for the timely shipment, much appreciated.
5	1364169600	I bought this for my 11 yo nephew. Although it was not brand new it worked perfectly and with a decent case it is still working with no problems or breaks,
5	1363910400	My old ipod was stolen at school.  This one is much better and arrived quickly.  Good price and good service.  I am really enjoying this one.
5	1363910400	I love the price i paid got it for my daughters 10 birthday she love it and so do i ....
5	1363910400	Got this model after much debate, I love it. I have plenty of room for movies, music and apps. Would highly recommend this for anyone looking to get an iPod. Ive had no problems with it, the software updates easily to keep your iPod up to date.
5	1363824000	I bought this item when it was first released and it still works great. I love it! iPods are very convenient and pretty much fit everywhere! I also love that there are so many cases I can buy at a low cost on Amazon! I definitely recommend this iPod
5	1363824000	When I was looking for an iPod after my 2nd gen started stop working all of a sudden, I immediately thought buying used. I'm a cash strapped student so I couldn't afford those new gen 5 iPods even though I wanted one really bad. I started looking around here and found one for a great price, $115. When I received it, I was expecting it to be banged up and have major scratches to the back. But to my surprise, it looked relatively new, no major dings or scratches, just the average marks on the back. People can't believe I bought it used and it works great! The battery life drains a bit quick, but that's only when I play games or watch videos. But as far as listening to music it last about 10 to 12 hours on a full charge. Highly recommend to buy used.
5	1363737600	Got this for a gift and they loved it! I am true to any Apple products and they are work every penny!
5	1363737600	Got this for a gift and they loved it! I am true to any Apple products and they are work every penny!
5	1363737600	I had to contact Ezcorp about this product not because I had problems with it (it is exactly as described, scratches on the back and brand new screen) but because I wasnt sure if I wanted it. The seller was very helpful and dealt with me to make the process easier. I ended up keeping the ipod and I'm glad I did.
3	1363737600	The recipient seemed to love it.  It worked well until she dropped it once on tile.  She now needs a screen replacement.
5	1363651200	I bought this for my son.  He specifically wanted this one because of the ability to video.  He's been extremely happy with it!
5	1363564800	I purchased this for my daughter and she enjoys it everyday. &#34;It is a good iPod all around!&#34; from my daughter. Shipping was reasonable and packaging was good. I highly recommend it to all music and game lovers!
5	1363478400	I purchased this device to connect to my surround sound in my home.  Worked for my purpose.....great tool to use
4	1363478400	slightly scratched but other then that good i still use it but it cant charge unless its turned off .
4	1363392000	It arrived one day before the estimated delivery. It had no cracks in the screen, though just a few smudges, but it still looks like new with a cover and a wiping.
5	1363392000	I lost it and in a movie theather. this is a great product and wih i had it. I would hightly recommend it
5	1363305600	Bought it for a friend and he loved it so much that when his finally broke, he bought another one.
4	1363305600	I'm giving this 4 stars because over all it's sort of out dated compared to the newer versions. But I still think it's great for music videos and more. Plus the new Ipods are also more money.
4	1363219200	I bought this for my daughter and it arrived promptly and from her perspective, everything works great.  The only thing we saw was that it seemed to have some water in the screen because she pressed down on the edge of it and some came out.  However, that was the only issue about and everything else is working great and there has been no problems with her downloading music or apps and using the other features.  All in all, this was a great buy!
3	1363219200	I got it, and i had to turn on Assistive Touch because the home button was broken. I then broke the screen a few weeks later.
5	1363219200	Bought this for my daughter and she uses it everyday for almost a year now. There were no issues and she never grew bored with it.
5	1363132800	came in fast. It does all the things I want it to do and more. I have sooo many downloads lol
5	1363132800	My daughter loves it. She hasn't put it down. Great product. Cool apps. Good for long car rides. Love it.
5	1363046400	I got my Ipod ahead of the expected time.  So far so good I am still in the process of learning how to use it.  It was in good condition.
5	1363046400	el producto cumplio con mis requerimientos y lo recomiendo a todo el publico en general. muy satisfecho en pocas palabras
2	1363046400	This iPod touch looked great. But, it didn't work.  I was so disappointed because I bought it as a gift for my 12 year old daughter.  As soon as I received it, I plugged it in to be charged.  After two or more hours of allowing it to charge, there was no indication that it was charging.  I waited until I got home and used a different charger and the results were the same.  I had to return it.  I am still waiting for a refund on this item.
3	1362960000	The ipod was very cheap and it was ideal for my 10 year old. the only problem with the ipod is that it must have had the screen replaced and it was &#34;super glued&#34; back on. when i got it, the screen was lifting up on one side and you could look inside the ipod. i ended up taking it to a cell phone repair center and they had to try to get all of the super glue off and add andhesive to it to keep it closed. i was fully aware it was used, but the description said it had several scratches on the back and sides, it never mentioned they had super glued the screen and it was barely on.
5	1362960000	It is in good shape thank you, you said it will have a lot of scratches in the back but it really doesn't which makes it better
5	1362960000	I hate apple don't like it one bit. but Loved this Ipad for workouts and when you are boored out of your mind. Don't know exactly how many songs it holds, haven't maxed it out. i had about 2k songs on there. its duriable. been through alot on deployments.
5	1362960000	This product arrived and was exactly as described. It was in excellent condition and seemed very well made. Was very happy with this purchase.
5	1362787200	BUY THIS WONDERFUL MAGICAL PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY ITS WONDERFUL. GREAT QUALITY. DROP IT ALL TIME BOUGHT IT OVT A YEAR AGO STILL HAVEIT AFTER IT WENT THROUGH THE WASh!!!And fell in sinkRice&#60;333
3	1362787200	phone was in good condition but when the screen was replace  you can see the edges and it feels like is going to brake other than that this  is a good ipod for a fair price
5	1362787200	I like the Cameras on both sides.  I like the new apps & Functionality.Picture quality is awesome.  Kids love to make their own action movies.  It is a kick.Action Movie app - Try it.  Pretty cool!!  Fast processing and easy to use.Touch functionality is awesome.
4	1362787200	Just bought this to replace someone else's that my granddaughter broke. She won't be getting one to replace her's for quite a while!
5	1362700800	But seriously.. she took it! She loved the iHeart app to keep track of her blood pressure, music, weather, and internet stuff all in one place. Has held up great. If it can survive a 65 year old woman - it can survive anything.
5	1362700800	Mi hijo adolescente esta muy contento con el producto por la cantidad de aplicaciones disponibles. Esperamos renovarlo pronto con la compra de un nuevo modelo
4	1362700800	work in the medical field and to look up drugs and side effects fast and easy and can't beat for the price.
5	1362528000	I wanted an I Touch to play with but did not want to pay full price. My I- Touch is a great &#34;toy&#34; which /i use to read my e-mail and listen to music. For those more tech savvy than myself, there are many games to play and apps to download. It is a great item!
5	1362528000	I bought this item used from Go-Auction.  Was amazed at the like new condition, the incredible professionalism of their staff and the speedy delivery. Very proud to give this item as a gift to my 12 yr old daughter who has used it every day since valentines day, games , apps, and facetiming with friends, it works beautifully without so much as a hiccup.  I Absolutely recommend Go-Auction as place for affordable used Apple products.
5	1362528000	muy buen productotodos debirian de comprar estose los recomiendo, es completamente excelente en tama&ntilde;o y calidadenvi&oacute; r&aacute;pido....
4	1362528000	Can't really complain about the device. It arrived as stated, with a brand new screen and scratches on the back. A rubber cover on it fixed the issue with the scratches as I had original intended to do.The screen was a little bit lifted by a milimeter or less on one corner but that was fixed by the same rubber cover. My daughter is happy and i'm happy that I didn't have to buy a new ipod or iphone.It is not a issue with the seller, but I did not know that ipods didn't have some features like indicating battery percentage remaining as opposed to just the more imprecise battery icon. No biggie just pointing it out.
1	1362441600	Threwout this items ENTIRE description, the information CLEARLY states REPEATADLY that the ipod is installed with ios 5.1, Even in the picture, the ipod is running ios 5.1. However, when the item arrived, I discovered that it was actually running ios 6.0. The only reason I oredered from here is because I had been looking everywhere for an ipod 4g running ios 5.1 & this item clearly indicated that it was running 5.1. I feel completely ripped off! (Its like recieveng Vista on a computer that was supposed to have 7)I dont even want this Garbage & if I try & sell it, I wont even get half of what I paid.
5	1362441600	I love it I love it I love it I love it that is all I can say is that I love it
5	1362355200	My son is really enjoying this product. He hasn't put it down yet. I recommend this one to others. This will make a great gift for a birthday or graduation.
5	1362355200	Ipod 8gb item came quickly and looks great! almost brand new shape!  very happy with the quality of this item.
5	1362268800	Got this in great shape and after a year or so it still works great! My mistake was not buying a case for it right away. It took me cracking the screen on concrete to realize I needed a case and screen protector! Ever since doing that, it's really help maintain the health of the device. Apple makes great products, but they're not exactly durable.
1	1362268800	Battery won't hold a charge, company says they will replace, just try and explain to a 5 year old why she can have her iPod for a few weeks
5	1362182400	I don't remember when I bought this for my daughter but she uses it every single day. You can go on line if you have a wi fi connection.  With apps, you can text your friends and even call them. No need for a cell phone with the wi fi. After about 1 year, it stops holding a charge.  She charges it and it starts to die within an hour.
5	1362182400	I bought this for my son for a birthday present. Since receiving this he has essentially mothballed his Nintendo DSi XL. It does exactly what we want it to do. My only gripe is with Apple for making it very difficult to set up an account for a child. I basically had to lie about his age in order to pull it off and set up an e-mail address under his name. There may be another way to do this but I wasn't able to find it. Either way, product works great, son loves it, shipping was reasonably timed. Definitely recommend buying this product.
5	1362096000	Recieved my Ipod yesterday.  Works perfectly and looks great.  I would recommend this supplier through Amazon to everyone.  Really look forward to using it and understanding all it's features.  I would purchase another one without any concerns.  Great product Amazon.
5	1362096000	just what i needed! perfect and i love apple products!haha, i just wish they could allow me to put an SD card into it:) thanks i DO recommend this item for anyone looking for an MP3
3	1362096000	This is a pretty neat little gadget, but I wish it had some of the additional features found on the iPhone, e.g., built in gyro so it could use compass aps; flash for camera that also makes a bright flashlight; better camera resolution; real GPS functionality.
4	1361923200	its in great shape but it freezes sometimes. it is worth it though because I got it for such a low price.
5	1361923200	I bought this a year or so ago and still use it! I mainly use it for apps and movies, and save other stuff(like music) for my normal iPod, and save my smartphone for more important stuff! Great buy!
5	1361836800	I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it because it has a camera. She has the 1st generation one and it broke.
5	1361750400	I bought this for my sister a year ago and its still works perfectly. I went and bought a 32gb model a year ago as well and mine also continues to work fine. Mine did freeze up at one point but its okay now. I only buy apple mp3 players because I love itunes so much and I recommended this to her. My mom wants to get an ipod as well but hers will be the nano. They are very easy to use and all you have to do is plug 'em in and drag your songs over to your ipod and you're done. Very simple. Besides lots of products work quite well with apple products.
5	1361750400	Was priced right!!  Does everything I want!!!  Of course after I bought the 8 gb the 16's went on sale!!!
5	1361750400	Perfect ipod 4th generation white i am happy  !, i am from venezuela and happy for my ipod  jajajaa i love ipod
5	1361664000	My child is &#34;hard&#34; on electronics. Was glad to find this at half the price of a new one. Received in the mail and was well packaged. Works great!
3	1361664000	the quality is okay, but not pefect.. The product frezzes at times... The ipod touch is a durable and easy to understand..
5	1361577600	My son saved up and bought this for himself in November of 2011.The price was good, and he really enjoys using it.  Not a day goes by that he isn't on it playing games or watching youtube. It's still going strong, no glitches or problems.  Easy to figure out and well worth the money spent.
2	1361577600	I bought this Ipod from Amazon instead of from Apple, I saved 8 whole dollars! it was a mistake. It works fine but I downloaded an App that tells you how to get the most out of the battery. So far, it is impossible to get a full charge, even when it says its done charging it never has accepted a full charge which is suppose to get the most life out of the battery. I wondered why Apple would let someone else sell their product cheaper than they would, now I think I know...I'm fixin to get an iPad, it will be from Apple ONLY!! And I'm mad at Apple too for unloading their less than perfect products to China.
5	1361577600	This is amazing i don't regret buying it at all! way better than the kindle if you ask me! ....Sure  a lot of tablets are cheaper but you really can never go wrong with an apple product!
5	1361577600	Another product bought as a refurb, this works really great and my daughter loves it and uses it all the time
1	1361491200	The article is wrong, the iPod is rebuilt, the Ipod is rebuilt and put it as if it were new. Do not buy this iPod is shoddy rebuilt. My screen was damaged, and drive you to see it and told me that the screen is false, not genuine, I regret having bought this.
5	1361491200	We have purchased 2 i pods from Go- Auction.  The products arrived on time. This company has great integrity. If there is an issue, they handle it quickly and well. If you want a great deal on a refurbished i Pod-  this is the place to go!
1	1361491200	The iPod was damaged after we received it and it had to be taken apart in order to repair it and this was done professionally.  It was found that not only was the iPod repaired previously but they used super glue to fix it.  Needless to say scraping the glu off was not easy.
1	1361491200	the product was junk.the battery was already shot.otherwise the return process went rather well.i.d never buy a used product.again.i
5	1361404800	I bought this ipod because i need a separate mp3 player since my cellphone battery dies immediately and i love it!; games web, social media, music, videos, skype... i can do anything with this iPod!, is an iPhone with no GSM/CDMA network. You can even use Magic Jack to call US numbers for free!The battery life is amazing, even when playing hardcore-great-graphics games.The only complain from this ipod will be the need of a flash for the camera. The photos are always noisy.
5	1361404800	I was skeptical about buying the ipod.  I didn't think it would be able to do that much.  It was our first apple product.  I was amazed that the apps they have out can do EVERYTHING.  My daughter found an app that made it to where she could text and use it as a phone without being charged.  Of course she would have to be using a hotspot, but who doesn't.  I am an avid android user, but I love the fact that no matter where you buy your apple product from if you have problems the apple store doesn't ask where you bought it!
5	1361404800	I got the Apple IPod Touch 8GB on time as promised.  So far I did not find any defect on the product as I have with many items.  It was well worth it.
5	1361404800	This ipod tough is just like the iphone without wifi. Once I put skype on there, it was a phone. The button in the center has gotten stuck the longer I have had it. It may be because I am heavy handed though. Love this ipod. I am so satisfied that I may not even upgrade because it has worked perfectly.
5	1361404800	muy buen producto. rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega. sin contratiempos en todo el proceso. lo recomiendo a a
5	1361232000	excellent product, I really liked'm very pleased with the purchase. . . . . . . . . . .
5	1361232000	It is great and works fine. It's quick and works like a computer. Very fast and like an cell phone.
5	1361232000	Great product!  Too bad my daughter has already dropped it and cracked the screen.  :-(.................... ............... ............ ............ ................ ...
5	1361145600	I love my iPOD Touch. I bought it for the size and convenience for when I travel. It got a lot of use when I traveled through Europe. Was able to use it at any cafe, restaurant, hostel, hotel, etc. that had wi-fI available.
4	1361145600	Im so happy I made this purchase. It arrived on time and with the items that it was supposed to bring.  For a refurbished IPod it works magnificently. I didn't really care for the headphones though.  The usb Charger is kind of weird.  It wont let my Ipod Connect to my Mac Computer.  When I insert the Usb into the port (while connected to the ipod) it says that it's unable to connect to the mac because it's pulling a lot of power from the mac and therefore disabling it to prevent damage to the laptop.  But when I connect it to an outlet or my mother's windows 7 PC, it works just fine.  Weird.  Over all the Ipod works fine looks as described and I am a satisfied customer.
5	1361145600	Love the product and all of its functionality.  In hindsight, it would be nice to have more memory so if there is a need to store a lot of music, pictures or apps on this, you can.  You will find yourself needing to delete some which are still available to put back through iTunes but can't all be stored on the iPod.
5	1361059200	Very good as every product from Apple. Very handy to listen music, to browse the internet, to watch videos in you-tube  and even to use Skype and Facebook, no regrets whatsoever.
4	1361059200	bought this one for a grand kid so that he would have an ipod himself so far he has not  tried to destory it
4	1360972800	was told in description the screen was cracked and it was scattered, but did work, My grandson had screen replaced.. Also had to purchase new charger as no cords came with it and that was as also noted in description..
4	1360886400	Amazing device. If all you need is an iPhone without the phone, this is the ONLY choice :)Apple maybe expensive, but we agree in something: There products have and amazing quality.
1	1360886400	Well I received my product today and sorry to say I was highly disappointed. I actually feel bad leaving a bad review somewhat. I ordered two of these iPod touch 4th generations, I got my products on time as promised but unfortunately only 1 was a 4th gen. The second one was a 2nd gen. This should not have even been possible seeing as I ordered 2 of the same product at the same time in the same transaction as in quantity 2. The difference in the two models is substantial and very noticeable at first glance, especially when you have two side by side.!!!! The older one is larger, heavier, and it has not even one camera! The newer model is smaller, thinner, lighter and has TWO cameras!!! When I got on chat with customer service I was told basically I could return the product and be issued a refund. When I checked the price had risen by $55 in a matter of 2 days!!! It is now even higher than new (not refurbished) iPod 4g on Amazon!!! I am so not happy!!!!!!
5	1360886400	this is your IPod Touch if you are looking to purchase a music player.. The IPod touch is the best music player on the market at this point in time..
1	1360886400	Was so disappointed. Purchased this and it has overheated and extremely hot to hold. It has never kept a charge for more than 2 hrs. Yuk!
4	1360800000	This Ipod arrived before scheduled delivery dates. I cannot rate the product since it has no earpiece, charger, and no manual.  So I paid for an ipod that i cannot use right now.
5	1360713600	This ipod touch was very good. But when i got it, it was like new. Except the back, of course. the back was roughly scratched up
3	1360713600	Don't know.  This was a gift I purchased for my granddaughter in California.  I'm sure she is enjoying it, we do play draw free on it together.
5	1360713600	This item was just as it was described- I gave this item as a gift and the recipient loved it!
5	1360713600	Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing. This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people.
5	1360627200	Excelente art&iacute;culo, en perfectas condiciones. Vendedor muy responsable, en comparaci&oacute;n con la l&iacute;nea de productos est&aacute; muy acorde a los requerimientos
5	1360540800	Although my husband was loath to give up his 32gb 3gs, he is so happy to have this new iphone 4 with faster speed and his son is enjoying the 3gs in Ukraine!
5	1360540800	It was a good iPod that he sold to me and I thank him a lot for it and again thank u
5	1360540800	Even though it has already came a newer model from this Ipod, and now it's called &#34;OLD MODEL&#34;, i still love it! it has many apps, and wi fi works very well. Battery for playing music is awsome, it last for lots and lots of hours, and battery its intact, no to say about playng games, or watching videos, that realy kills it. This little issue apart, it's amazing.
5	1360540800	this was bought to have as an extra music devie to use on our Bose wave radio to run sound/sleep machine and for music.
3	1360454400	The feature set and usability of the iPod are well known and highly respectable, so I won't review the line here. That said, while my friends report days of battery life under light-use conditions, my battery dies in less than 24 hours while idle. Also, the HOME button is very flaky. You have to really press down on it (compared to my other four iOS products) , and then you sometimes get a double-click effect, bringing up the task manager. This is clearly a defective unit in these two areas.
4	1360454400	Overall this product works great but I have to admit I wasn't familiar with Apple products at all.  When we plug this item into the computer, it comes up saying that the Ipod is too hot and won't work.  Otherwise when we plug the item into the wall it charges and works fine.  I did not complain to the seller about this because other than plugging the item into the computer it is working fine.  It appears that plugging it into a laptop that has Windows 8 on it, it works fine but on a laptop running another Windows Program or a desk top, it comes up with the running hot message.  Overall this is a good product.
5	1360454400	I ordered this for my neice and the day it arrived, someone stole it out of the box on her porch and left the box there for her to find. She was devastated!!! But, I called Amazon and made them aware of what happened and they shipped her a new one within 2 days. Thank Heavens for businesses like Amazon, who really helped save a poor little girl's broken heart!
5	1360368000	I bought this for my granddaughter and she did like it.  At first I thought it was an ipad when I first looked at the picture that is why I thought I didn't purchase it.  Sorry!
2	1360281600	This ipod was dropped from a height of about 2 feet onto carpet, and the screen shattered- only three weeks after purchase.
5	1360195200	how long though does it take to deliver and how big is the package because no one is usually home when the mail comes and i dont want the mail people to keep coming and no one is home to get my ipod thanks if any1 could get back to me that would be awesome thanks.
3	1360108800	Can't rate this fairly as I don't use it. It is my son's iPod and was used to help me with other downloads.
5	1360022400	very easy to use, had no problems. My son loves it and it nice and small to fit in a game bag and nice for traveling.
5	1360022400	if 100% recommend this product as it is very efficient, safe, easy to acquire, is an excellent phone with unique acquisition
5	1360022400	todo bien gracias, r&aacute;pido, excelente, vendedor buena la oferta espero volver a  comprales otra ves  sin mas nada que decir.
5	1359936000	I got it for a friend and she is very pleased with it. I mean, it's an iPod, we all know how good they are.
5	1359849600	Arrived on time, it works like new, this is a great iPod besides the little scratches on the back its great.
5	1359849600	I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! i got it and it had absolutely no scratches, it works perfectly!
5	1359849600	Everything works great and it got to my home super fast! Like literally 2 days after ordering. The screen is brand new and the back does have scratches but I'm putting a cover over it anyway. I love it.
5	1359849600	this is a great product and my son really loves this, just as described and works excellent.  thank you for this.
1	1359849600	Not sure why my ipod only has 5GB when there should be 8GB since I bought it. Thought I was doing something wrong so I reset my ipod twice to factory settings and it still says I only have 5GB on it. Feel ripped off... DO NOT BUY unless you do not mind having to delete things all the time.
5	1359849600	Bought this for my grandson's ninth birthday and he loves it.  This old fogey is dumb as a dinosaur about smart phones and the like, but he had no trouble mastering it--the only problem now is that his parents can barely get him to put the thing down!  No problems whatsoever with the I-Touch or the seller, highly recommend.
2	1359849600	I bought three iPods (for my kids) in March that friends were to bring to me (I live in Brazil).  I had them turn them on and make sure they were all working.  When I got the iPods in June I decided to save them for Christmas gifts for my kids.  So I got them all ready & Dec. finally arrived.  The kids were crazy excited.  Now it's Feb. 2nd and one of the iPods is no longer working.  The screen is totally white & I can't get it to work any more.  Even from purchase date, it's only been 8 months.  I'm so disappointed!  I've been so happy with Apple most other times, but this time it just stinks!  We can't get another one or even go to an Apple Store for support because of where we live...and that's why I picked Apple, because I thought it would last.  Ugh!
5	1359763200	Excellent service! I love my ipod. It got lost in the mail, But they quickly replaced the one I never got & I'm happy with what I got.
2	1359763200	this item took 13 days to get which scared me mostly because there was no star reviews plus when i order an item i always track where its located and follow it but u couldnt track this.I got it yesterday and was very disappointed because when it was ordered i picked it because it said like new but nothing is like new about it.the back looks like it has been dropped at least 30 or 40 times its scratched and scraped up badly on the back and the front has scratches.it was a gift for my daughter and i had to tell her it was used because it looked so bad.there was no charger with it i had to buy one .also i paid 110.00 dollars for it so i expected like new met just what it says like new.I gave it a 2 star rating because it seems to play good so far but its only been 2 days.I thought about returning it but not sure at this point.will most likely not use this seller again.
5	1359763200	I love my iPad so much. I stay on it all the time. Twenty four hours if I had the time.
5	1359763200	Purchase years ago and is still a good product. Screen is not a clear as new product but it serves it's purpose.
5	1359590400	I bought it for my husban son. He made a life around that ipod. Photos, games, calendar, of course, music. recommended for youngs, not less than 12yrs.
5	1359590400	Me llego el producto tal cual se ve en la imagen, excelente super r&aacute;pido en perfecto estado, muy responsable recomendado 100%
1	1359590400	Ordered an ipod4  it said it was used in good condition used it for awhile for about 8 months then the power button breaks them it just shuts off and it's done took it to a repair shop they opened it and it looks like some body took it a part and messed with it there were no screws holding it together like some tried to fix it put one or to screws in it and called it good, do not buy used iPods used from this company
5	1359590400	This iPod is very good. Quite durable as well and a lot like my iPhone. I really like it a lot
5	1359590400	I had asked my mom for 2 years to get an ipod touch and she always said no. so i bought one myself. When i bought it it was only $164.00 so its gone up a little.But this was a GREAT purchase! I have had my Ipod for Over 8 months now! Its in great shape and its everything they said it was! the only disappointment was that they said there would only be a few hairline scratches on the back! But when i got it the back was all scratched up! :( But other than that the screen is amazingly clear! I know its a lot of money, but trust me its worth it!!!!!!! :) P.S Get the 32gb instead of the 8gb because it dose'nt fit much. I Love my ipod i play with it all the time! &lt;3
5	1359504000	My daughter loves it. Much better. Received it very quikely.. She is having lots of fun playing her games.MUCH BETTER THAN THE 2ND GENERATION...
5	1359504000	I never really wanted an ipod but I got this for nursing school and it has been a lifesaver! Small and easy to carry in your pocket but all of your reference materials are right there. As I said I never wanted one before but now, I can't imagine doing clinicals without it!
5	1359504000	Love this ipod. I recommend this item to anyone. you will not be disappointed with it. I am thinking about purchasing another.
3	1359504000	I read the info on this item and it said it had never even been out of its case.  But when I received it, it had numerous scratches on the ipod itself.
5	1359504000	Works great does everything i expected! have never had a problem with it. updates fast and holds a charge for a long time
5	1359504000	Apple does it again. I got this for a birthday last year and my little boy loves it. He constantly plays games on it and enjoys it with all of his other toys. I would recommend this item but perhaps not for anyone under 10 years.Albert
5	1359417600	practically flawless awesome value I wish I had gone through you guys instead of buying new on my other two ipods
1	1359417600	Bought this 6 months ago and its garbage. For 1 its been dropped once and the screen has cracked but thats not my main problem with this ipod. I use it in a bose sounddock which this item doesnt work in anymore. It doesnt work because of the cheap wire harness ill call it in the bottom where you slide it onto the sounddock. Unlike the iphone 3 i now have in the sounddock which has a soild harness in it to slide in and out this ipod touch has some cheap wires in it that bend somehow, i just noticed this week 4 or 5 of these wires bent, now i know why it doesnt work anymore. For the price you would think a little better construction would go into it but its actually a downgrade from an iphone 3.  Buy yourself a used ipod or better yet i used an old iphone
5	1359417600	We love the iPod.  Music sounds so true.  use it all the time.  I would recommend it to young and old and inbetween.
5	1359417600	This product was a good buy.  Even though it is now outdated it is a necessary part of &#34;must take&#34; items daily!
5	1359331200	This will go down as one of the best purchases I have ever made. It is not very often that this Ipod leaves the hands of my daughter, well worth the money!
5	1359331200	Product is excellent but hardly any use in real life now as smart phones replacing it completely. Good for kids though. Had some hiccups with amazon customer service but taken care by them at the end.
4	1359331200	pod is working,all is well but after some time passed it stop working i am so sad but nothing is made to last forever
5	1359331200	Same as all the other Ipods, which are the best mp3 players anyway.  I don't use facetime much, but the option is nice to have.  If you have small ears though, scrap the headphones. You can't lie down on your side with them on, and they hurt to wear. I ditched those and bought some in-ear buds made for Apple Ipod by Sony.
1	1359331200	Dissapointed send me a check or a new iPod please you were suppose to and it was my old card that's expired now and my bank can't do anything about it my son and I are very upset and dissapointed or I will be taking my business elsewhere thanks Pamela turner
4	1359244800	I bought this for my grandson. I was a little worried about buying used by it was in very good shape and he was thrilled.
4	1359244800	so my sister in law has had hers for a few years, my wife liked  it and so we finally decided to get it.  One of the main things she wanted to do was to be able to take pictures where ever (her phone doesn't have a great camera) and play games and keep music and such but the camera on my wifes (the one listed here) doesn't take good pictures at all. they come out grainy and almost like there isn't enough light for them or something, but we were pretty disappointed in that.  Guess all the attention that it got was just hype.  any way we like it over all for games and passing the time every so often, the wife also like to watch netflix on it in bed while I am finishing my work in the evenings.  All in all good, but not great.
5	1359244800	This was a great use of my Christmas money and I my IPod. A++++++++ this is an awesome choice. Buy It!!!!!
5	1359072000	This was a Christmas present and our daughter hasn't put it down since. Will most likely order more in future.
5	1359072000	I bought this for my 38-year old son for Christmas. He uses it constantly. It allows him to communicate with FaceTime and also allows him to play some of his Facebook games. He has had no problems at all with it and is really very happy about the product. His daughter, 14 years old, also has one, and she spends more time on hers than he does. This is a great product. Also, would like to touch on the delivery of the product. We weren't expecting it until after Christmas. I think, the first day of delivery was stated as 12/28, we received it on 12/23 which really made for a Merry Christmas!!!
5	1358985600	I like this item it's great!! I got it for my son for christmas and he loves it, takes it everywhere.
5	1358985600	I gave this product as a bday present and so far everyone seems to be happy with it. I will recommend this to anyone.
5	1358985600	I am very pleased with the way this iPod works, no issues with it so far! It works very fast and takes excellent pictures. It sounds great when I play music! Very satisfied over all.
5	1358985600	Came on time and was in perfect condition. The screen was not cracked (i have seen other reviews complaining that theirs was). All in all, perfect product
5	1358985600	My kids love their ipods. The wifi access is great so they can listen to music, download games, text & call for free as well as video calling.
2	1358899200	el producto llego con el solo detalle de una salida quemada, parecen productos reconstruidos. soy de venezuela. lo mas cumbre de la cuestion fue que lo compre con la tienda [*amazon]*.. esto creo que es cuestion de suerte comprar por aqui.
4	1358812800	I was very happy with this product, being used it was not cleaned very well before delivery and had other people information on it so I had to delete it.  Arrived in a very timely manor, I would refer friends to this..  DD is very very happy with it.
1	1358812800	I know I bought the cheapest one on the list but it came with no USB cord and the screen was cracked. The people I bought it for were worried that it might have been a stolen iPod. I'm sure it wasn't but still very unsatisfactory.
5	1358726400	Got this for my granddaughter and she loves it. Her parents liked it so much they got one for the other girl
4	1358640000	My loving wife and daughter are both happy with their gifts because the units are very handy and fit perfectly with thier life styles
5	1358553600	The price was perfect for me when I bought this, I got my mom the same one for mothers day came in a clean brand new box and everything with headphones I just love it!
5	1358467200	Love this Take it golfing and to the doctorsClean and came exactly as described not disappointed at allWould recommend again
5	1358467200	love the size of this unit. use it mostly for music use it sometimes for the internet. which it came with a manual.
5	1358467200	This was an awesome purchase for the price, and it also worked out fine as a graduation gift for my son...
4	1358380800	I like very much this iPod, the technology is just outstanding. It moves so smoothly. And there are so many choices for apps in the appstore. It has so many things. The only thing I don't like is the lack of a memory expansion slot. With 8GB (that are in fact only 6,5 because of the operating system and other technical issues) I replenished it with some songs and some apps. There is no more memory, if you want to put another app or song, you have to delete some of the apps you already have, which anyway remains in your apple ID and you can re-download it whenever you want.
5	1358380800	This was bought for an 8yo who wanted an &#34;I phone&#34; for the holidays. She got this instead and LOVES it. . . and WOW - she figured out how to make a call on it!!!! This was a &#34;used&#34; product, but looked to be in great shape. It came with all accessories and after a quick wipedown, it looked as good as new. And, it runs flawlesssly. We are thrilled with this item.
5	1358380800	just the right ipod touch for the enjoyment of my 9 and 11 y.o. sons. they have so many games that are free or cheap for them to purchase compared to 3ds. they can also face time each other, send email. great toy for travelling.
5	1358380800	This came as they said it would. We thought we had lost it when delivered. I e-mailed them right away theu were working on it with the post office . And after looking online at the tracking. We realized that it was not put in the mailbox it was put in there porch. My Grandson is very excited and happywith his new IPOD.  I never lost faith. I knew you would have made it right for all what you did to help sove this.So for me a 5 for great customer servicra 5 carring for your customersAnd a 5 for sticking through until the end because you came off as a person that would make it right. I would buy from you anytime. Thanks Again for all your help.
4	1358380800	I would like it more if Apple had not changed the Itunes web site.  The previous web site was much easier to navigate and I still have to find out how to authorize my new laptop.  I called Apple and they told me to look for the &#34;authorize computer&#34; on the upper left side of the site but there is no &#34;authorize computer&#34; command there.
5	1358380800	Best Xmas gift still using it today!  Great way to play mindcraft when bored.  Love it, I would recommend it to everyone.
5	1358294400	I have been very pleased with this purchase.  I bought this to download books to and it has been great.I am still learning.
5	1358294400	Hard to go wrong with an ipod.  Price was same here as everywhere else, and I didn't have to go out to shop for it.  The 8 GB is plenty of space for an elementary school aged owner, and it is working beautifully.
5	1358294400	i love ipods! this is same apple store condition! i still use it and have had it for three years! back gets scratched easily so buy a case too.
5	1358294400	It was worth every penny.  I've downloaded games, music and takem many pics with my iPod and loving the convenience and how much fun I'm having with it!
5	1358294400	This in a strange way is one of the my favorite purchases I have ever made. It does just about everything I want out of it and so...SO much more.Honestly it isn't just a music player. Its also a phone now in my life, I have cut a $40.00 cell phone bill to $0.00 with this! I can play fun games with it and capture memories using its camera.With the app store an IPod is a device I use everyday for just about everything. Even research for me and my customers.In short if you want an IPod...Buy one and don't think twice, but considering the 5th gen. is currently out if you can afford that I would highly recommend doing the upgrade because of the power, speed, LED flash, and size.
5	1358208000	I bought this as one of my first Amazon purchases and have been very pleased with product.  My daughter has not gone a day without using it since we purchased it.  Great for pre-teens.
5	1358208000	It is awsome only thing wrong with it is it has a little black scratch at the top of chrome.
3	1358208000	I bought this for my daughter in like new condition, to save money. The good is that we saved a little money. It was in like new condition except we didn't receive any of the papers that come with an iPod. Like how to set it up and how it works. Also the speaker was very fuzzy and quite worker a few days ago. Luckily the sound still works with earbuds.
5	1358208000	I BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE LOVES IT. SHE HAD A 2ND GENERATIONS BUT WANTED ONE A NEWER ONE.
5	1358121600	A replacement for a broken Itouch...the quality and price are right!  It works perfectly and has all the same accessories as a new one.
5	1358121600	The IPOD is not an unknown product so I will not waste time talking about how it worked great. Instead I just want to mention that it was delivered very rapidly and in tip top shape.

5	1358035200	when i got the ipod it was in perfect condition.  It had all the accessories.  It runs very fast.  Everyone should have one.Kay & Kevin Meredith
5	1358035200	I am very happy with this item and it works as you said and have no problems at all with it,
5	1358035200	I purchased this item for my grandson for Christmas, and he is delighted with it. It is a staple of his wardrobe now, like wearing socks or shoes. He spends hours chatting with his friends, playing games, and taking pictures. I don't think I have ever bought him a Christmas present that he has enjoyed more.
3	1357948800	the product works good, just was scuffed up on the back. overall it works good. it updated on the first power up. the camera works good too.
5	1357948800	In great condition! So worth the wait and the cost! there is light scratching on the back, that you can only see when reflected in the light, and it comes with a screen protecter. :D
5	1357948800	Bought as a gift for 17-year-old teen who loves it. It's served many uses from listening to music, playing games, texting friends, keeping schedules and more.  Additional purchase of inexpensive attachment for listening to music through car radio recommended.
5	1357948800	They look and work like new. Perfect for a budget or someone that is giving them to kids as I did.
5	1357862400	Apple has great products and this is one of them. I ordered this for my nephew and he really enjoys it.
5	1357776000	Very surprised at the price and quality of this product. I would purchase again from this webb site.  Great product!
5	1357776000	We are very happy with the ipod. Thank you so much. This was a Christmas gift to our daughter and we are glad that we made our purchase through Amazon.
4	1357689600	came on time as showed in the estimated time. and the product came like brand new. still enjoying the iPod. no problems at all
3	1357689600	I bought it as a used model, and it worked well for what I wanted. It was a little bit slow at a couple of the functions, but no biggie.
5	1357689600	I was concerned about buying an older model, but I had a budget.  I have been thrilled with the performance of this and would recommend it heartily for anyone who might be looking for a first IPod.
5	1357689600	My daughter loves this ipod.  It has all the bells and whistles, although it looks like technology never ends so I expect a better version to come out soon, if it hasn't already!
5	1357603200	Brought these items for my two  grand childern as a Xmas gift and they will not be visiting until mid january.
5	1357603200	Great product, offers the use of apps and wifi which is incredibly useful nowadays. I recommend this product to anyone who needs a way to keep in touch with social media on the go without a smart phone.
1	1357603200	I bought this item new and it came with no headphones also it only came with a charget to the computer via usb? It did'nt have any instuctions or anything it didn't seem like it was in a new condition.
5	1357603200	My iTouch came in the condition exactly as described, and came sooner than expected. It was packaged with plenty of bubble wrap and came with everything I expected. This was a great price to get it at so I was a little leery, but now I know that this is a trusted seller on Amazon.
5	1357516800	I was hesitant on ordering this iPod because I've been screwed over in the past. The iPod came in good condition and works perfectly fine. Thank you.
5	1357516800	This device is an absolut an excellent experience for listening music and watching videos. So, i wonder why its doesn' come with better earphones.
5	1357430400	Shipped quick and works like a charm. My daughter loves it! Item was as described with minor scratches, etc. Everything works perfectly.
5	1357430400	i love my ipod this is so fun to play with it is really cool and i can keep in touch with old friends as well
5	1357430400	This is a really great technology gadget to have. I have taken so many pictures with it and I love how you can send pictures to anyone. The apps are really cool and the music is crystal clear. Best investment yet.
3	1357430400	But why not just get an iphone, seems to be another product thats not needed, but if you dont need the phone, its a good product that does everything it supposed to, but then again its apple so you have to live by their rules.
2	1357430400	ipod, was broken the charger cord and the ear phones stop working by sevan days.need to send back to amozon.
5	1357430400	I bought this Apple iPod touch for my grandson. I thought he was too young for it; he is 9 years old; but his parents said it was okay. He wanted it mainly to download music since his big brother had one and he liked listening to it. I was with him one evening and he had to read a book for homework for school. He had to read for 15 minutes. He used the timer on his iPod touch and if we had to take a break he could pause it and start up again. He pulled up the Google map and showed me where I live. I know he really loves it.
2	1357344000	i bought an iphone right after i got this so sorry this is not a good idea to get this if you are going to get an iPhone
2	1357344000	My son bought this product brand new, about 2 years ago. He never liked it, and recently he handed it down to me.  I have to say it does not live up to all the hype. The most annoying problem among many, is the fact that I have to constantly charge this ipod. The battery goes down very quickly whether you are using it or not. If you are leaving it to sit for a few days, or you are using it for 45 minutes at a time, it does not matter either way. It just does not hold a charge for a long time. Even in airplane mode the battery depletes quickly and again....whether you are using it or not. I have an ipod classic that I have had much longer (over 4 years)and I practically never have to charge it. The charge lasts for months even with heavy music listening, and for a reasonable length of time with heavy movie watching. Also if I don't use it for several days, the battery is still charged and ready to go. Unlike the Touch it does not just die even if I haven't used it.  So if you want an ipod, in my experience the Classic is the best choice. No the Classic has no WiFi capabilities, but what good is WiFi if the device is dead most of the time and needs to be charged, with even the most delicate use? In fact last night I charged the ipod Touch, and I decided to just leave it plugged in. That's the only way it will stay charged. This problem was apparent immediatly so it is not due to anything we did during the time we've had it. Anyway if you want a hand held device with WiFi, the Kindle Fires look really nice and they are priced much more reasonably than Apple ipads. I have a Kindle e ink with WiFi which I love...and it holds a charge forever even with constant use....but now I'm getting off topic.The second problem with the Touch is, when you are on a web sight, the page takes forever to load, and sometimes it just never loads. I sit there watching that little wheel going around and around and... nothing. So for web surfing it is pretty useless. Plus, lately I've noticed that whenever the battery depletes which is all the time, as I've noted above, after you charge the ipod, the settings are messed up. Last night I noticed the date that spontaneously appeared and began trying to remember what I was doing on December 31st 1969. Because that's the date that appeared. When I tried to fix this, it would not let me! It was as if the ipod was possessed by the devil. It refused to leave December 31st 1969 so I guess that is the new date on my ipod for eternity.More problems: He bought the 8gb which was a big mistake, and it seems Apple doesn't even make that size anymore. Which is a good thing because of course it holds nothing. I might as well dig up my carrying case filled with my old 45s and just walk around with that. At least I'll get to hear more music. Or... perhaps a Sony Walkman! Again your best bet is the ipod Classic. With 140 gbs (my 4 year old one has 80 which is still A LOT) you can download every song that's ever been recorded if you want to. Not that you would want to, but I'm just saying that you can. Plus it has great sound...which leads me to the sound on the ipod Touch. Ok no complaints there. The sound on the Touch is great. But what good is that if the darn thing is dead all the time? Lastly, what's going on with the price of this old version?? My son didn't pay over 200 bucks for it. Like I said he bought it brand new on Amazon and I believe at the time, it was only about 159 dollars. So the price is ridiculous for an old version that only has 8gbs. The newest generation 16gb ipod Touch is much more reasonable. So if you must have an ipod Touch it's obvious that the newest version with twice the storage and a low price, is a better choice. Again, for the amount of storage you recieve, the Classic priced at only 245 dollars is also a better choice.
1	1357344000	everything works nice except when your kid runs out of memory since apple doesnt want to let you expand the memory on their products now you have to buy a newer one until that one runs out and so on and so on! save your money buy a toshiba
5	1357344000	My daughter loves it. It works great. She has had not problems with it. It was so worth the price.
4	1357344000	it is awesome but it should have come with instructions.  It would be easier to program if it had them
5	1357344000	i cant say enough about this item.my daughter used the life out of it until we got her the ipad.. then she passed this on the her younger sister. and its still going strong
5	1357344000	Best iPod ever! Great sound good screen doesn't get damaged easily good for songs not games. Good for travel good
1	1357344000	i recieved my ipod today and then i tried connecting to wifi and said unable to connect to the wifi i need message back to know if the ipod is damaged or something because whose going to buy an ipod that has no wifi in it.
5	1357344000	I would recommend this product and seller to anyone. Not only was the price right but they also threw in a few cases for it for free. It just so happens to be that the cases were for girls and it was a gift for my daughter. Thanks so much!!
4	1357257600	I bought this for one of my children to use at college for internet access since the campus is totally wifi-ed.  Works good for it's intended purpose as well as the entertainment features of an ipod.
4	1357257600	got this for granddaughter for xmas gift 2 years ago and she had used it daily until it fell out of her  pocket on the school bus last January.  highly recommend the product but read fine print on the insurance before getting that insurance.
5	1357257600	Only issue I have is I wish I had gotten my daughter the 16GB iPod.  I was thinking she would use it more for music as I was upgrading her from just an MP3 player.  But with all the Apps she has quickly run out of space.
3	1357171200	im glad it came ive had it for like 2 months it works but the home button gets stuck a lot i have to click it like 3 times for it to work
5	1357171200	My daughter loves her ipod and plays it all the time. It is a awesome little device. Great job Apple!
2	1357171200	I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and didn't open it until Christmas morning. When we did, it did not work. When I contacted the seller they would do nothing about it because it had pasted the two weeks return policy by amazon. I do understand this policy, but with it being a Christmas gift, I would have appreciated some better customer service for such an expensive item.
5	1357171200	These screen protectors work very well. They don't scratch easily and when they get a little smudged a quick wipe makes them new again
1	1357171200	i actualy did not receave what the add said of a white ipod touch 8gb i got a black ipod
5	1357084800	I have had it for a year now and it still works well even after being dropped in water, on the ground, and down the stairs 2x. Opps !! I would buy another one any day
4	1357084800	I gave this as a Christmas gift and they loved it. No scratches or breakage and everything was included even the Apple logo sticker!
1	1357084800	paying for this ipod i could of got it from the store for the same price and it would of came with a usb cord and headphones..never again i will order electronics from them.  A total rip off
4	1357084800	This is a reconditioned ipod I bought for my son for Christmas.  It's newer than the one he broke and works with the new apps.  He loves it and it works great!!!
5	1357084800	Good product for what I payed.  Its the old model but does not matter for what I do with it.  Pandora and wed surfing.
5	1356998400	Bought for my wife to use while running so she can listen to music. She uses it everytime she runs and it helps keep her motivated. A plus is I bought a little external speaker that plugs into the headphone port and we listen to Pandora in the house using it.
5	1356912000	This was a great Christmas gift for a 13yr old. It was in perfect condition! He was over the top happy
5	1356912000	We love our iPods.  I can't believe we waited so long to get them (mostly because we didn't understand all these electronic products).  But this investment was WELL worth our money - the kids play with them constantly.
4	1356912000	My brother is disabled and we have been racking our brains to find something he could use safely. This fit the bill! He only needs the pictures and camera apps for now. He loves to take pictures and videos but more he likes to swipe through them. It is the size he can handle and just large enough to see. An iPad mini would be too big for him to hold and take a photo with one hand. Being able to control all the settings and make the device secure from all the people that handle my brother (and from my brother) was the other selling point. Used, it was in our price range. It's really the only device with true swipe technology!
4	1356825600	The condition of this Ipod Touch was nearly perfect.  Only minor scratches on the back that are covered by a skin anyways. The only problem is it was running IOS 4.3.  When I attempted to wipe and reinstall a new IOS I found out this particular Ipod had ben jailbroken and would not allow me to upgrade the software.  It took me about an hour to find a work around and get it running the latest version.  Over all I am pleased but had I not been able to update the software I would have returned it.
3	1356825600	This was my second IPod touh and I am seriously displeased. My screen is so glitchy.  You can't go on some apps without it crashing and sometimes the screen just freezes. It is a huge pain when I am playing a game like Temple Run. I just ordered a new IPod nano with a touch screen and I am dreading that the screen is going to glitch and I will have to start biying the shuffles so I can have an IPod last me more than a couple years. Apple needs to stop making new IPods because they are just getting worse and worse.
3	1356825600	Should have purchased larger 16 GB unit, otherwise all ok.  Just don't load tons of pictures and apps it cannot handle it.
5	1356825600	It came so fast in the mail I couldn't believe it! Excellent little gadget and durable. My son is extremely happy with it!
5	1356825600	I get this out when I have to wait somewhere such as a ball game movie or other places. It makes the time pass faster and you don't mind the wait if yhou have something to do.
4	1356739200	I bought this ipod and everything is great just one doubt why is this 8gb ipod the same price as the 16gb?
5	1356739200	I love this product, and use it every day. It even came with a bonus case to protect it from scratches.  Highly recommended !
5	1356652800	This is a good iPod. Good battery and you can do all the apps that your want. Ive had it for years.
2	1356652800	OK I tried the Ipod, it is a great tool, but unless you want to buy the overpriced Apple apps, music etc, stay away. It is a portable jukebox, that is it's main function. Better values to be found elswhere. Your buying the name and cool factor
5	1356652800	In July of 2012 I bought myself a 4 generation 8GB Ipod Touch and i was so excited to open it. After that I was setting it all up and it was really easy and simple. I soon found myself in the app store buying tons of apps that i had heard about. The downloads where fast and didn't take very long unless it was something really big. I got all the apps i needed and i tried them all out and they worked great.It was nice to get updates for them too.There is calender, camera, videos, clock, facetime, safari, music, app store, itunes store, calculator, weather, maps, game center, newsstand, contacts, voice memos, imessage, passbook, mail, reminders nike+ipod, and stocks. They all come already downloaded to your ipod. The imessage comes with free texting (as long as you have wifi) and you can video chat with people with facetime (also needs wifi).It's also really nice because you can customize it with different settings and all that good stuff.The only real problems I had were that I got the one with only 8GB because it was the cheapest but I thought have just got the 16GB or the 32GB. It's because I like to get a lot of apps and I already have 49 apps and I still have 414MB left but I guess it depends on how big the apps are.The another problem was when you are updating the software it takes along time. The one update I did took 3 hours but it was totally worth it.The last problem is that you have to have wifi to do things that need internet. But you can easily fix that by turning your phones hotspot on or being in a place with wifi.Overall this is a really good product and I would definitely recommend buying this Ipod Touch. It is definitely worth the money.
3	1356652800	The IPod came in good condition. The charging cord that came with it doesn't work. Debating on going through the trouble returning the cord.
5	1356652800	I chose this rating because I am pleased with the product and recommend the product to those interested in something like
5	1356652800	My grandson was so happy to receive this ipod and that makes me happy.  It was bran new condition with a 90 day warranty
2	1356652800	this was i nice unit how ever there was not ear phones in this order and loker to me as if this was a used unit sold as new
5	1356566400	My kids though I had lost my mind buying this. I only wish I had ordered with more memory I did not realize your can't add a SD card for more.
4	1356566400	i absolutely love apple! this itouch was in great shape! it looks nice! just great for everything! since its used the camera is okay not the best tho
4	1356480000	Excellent choice - these have appropriate settings and ability for my children.  Wonderful opener for them into the Apple world.  Kids and I just love them.
5	1356480000	Bought this item for myself and love it. Use it for my music and to read ebooks on. works great but I should have bought the 16 gig.
2	1356480000	This was advertised as being like new but it arrived dented with sticky stuff all over the back of it. This was a Christmas gift. It took awhile to clean it up but I never did get all the sticky stuff off.
5	1356480000	Very good ipod touch 4th, and have an excellent design.yes, i am. This product is very interesting.This product is shipped to Quito-Ecuador.
5	1356480000	Granddaughter loved it and it was worth a million dollars to see her so excited!  I would recommend to anyone!
5	1356393600	I bought this as a birthday present for my boyfriend. It works really well. The button doesn't always work immediately, but other than that it works great!
4	1356393600	it was just what I ordered! It was packaged well, but there were chips around the edge of the glass screen that i wasn't very happy about
5	1356393600	I was looking for a slightly older model for my 10 year old who had been using his older brother's iPod touch, which no longer charged. This purchase was a great Christmas present.
1	1356393600	not worth buying a refurbished item.  should have bought new. Both of the i Pods coame to me with the old owners stuff still on it.  Then when trying to creat an account at the app store it would not allow me to do it, something about me not being old enough at the age of 40.
5	1356393600	So I purchased this for my father, and it was everything I expected. The product worked efficiently, and came fast enough for me to wrap.
5	1356393600	My son Ramsey is 14, the 2 things he wanted most for Christmas this year were #1: A pair of custom shoes with RIP on the left heel & Luke on the right heel (in memory of his best friend that passed away in April) & #2: An iPod Touch 4th generation in white. I placed an order for 7 items on Amazon December 21st that included the very iPod my son wanted, We got home from my mother's Christmas Eve Night & the iPod was in the mailbox!!!! Mr. Richins, my son Ramsey said tell you he loves you...lol. :) We will definitely look for more items we need or want from you! The iPod was refurbished & in PERFECT condition!!!! Can't tell the difference in this one & a brand new one & almost half the price. Thank you Mr. Dean &#34;Santa Claus&#34; Richins! Out of everything I ordered from Amazon & a certain shoe company, THE ONLY present that came in before Christmas Day is the one you sold! His Shox didn't even come in & I paid extra for expedited shipping! You are awesome!
4	1356307200	I received my product and could not be happier. i knew I did not want to pay for a high priced brand new one for my 7 year old so I took a chance and bought used. It was in like new condition. Very pleased!
5	1356307200	This has been a God send. It keeps my granddaughter busy on some long drives. It came in great time for a gift as well.
5	1356307200	Bought this item refurbished and there was no way of knowing it was not brand new. Durable while providing excellent quality.
2	1356220800	it looks cool but its a older model of the ipod touch so its looks like theyre only in one color.
5	1356220800	Apple iPod touch 8 GB Black (4th Generation) [OLD MODEL]  works great. Apple iPod touch 8 GB Black (4th Generation) [OLD MODEL]  works great.
5	1356134400	These arrives in good working order.  I went ahead and got them set up for my girls as I ordered 3 of these for Christmas presents.  They were easy to set up.  They are in great shape and I would order from this retailer again
3	1356134400	Apple products are superb and to me, it's apples to oranges versus other products. I bought this for my daughter's birthday so she could iMessage and FaceTime with friends and family who own iPhones. It's great in that respect and my daughter loves it. No complaints from her whatsoever.I though, think it's sub-par. I have an iPhone 4 with the A4 chip. The iPod performs nothing like my iPhone 4 regarding speed. It's a turtle in comparison. I've been so disappointed. Thankfully, my daughter doesn't know otherwise.I thought iPod touches were geared for playing games and such. It's no where near the speed it should be. I can't say I wouldn't have bought it had I known, as the intention was for her to be able to iMessage and FaceTime. I've disappointed with it ever since it was purchased. I've gotten to the point where I cannot stand playing anything on it because of the lag. It's VERY frustrating.Like I said, thankfully, my daughter hasn't complained or made the connection as to how much faster the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s we have in our household is. I'm also disappointed that eight months later, the newest iPod touch came out with an A5 chip. I wonder how much slower it is in comparison to the iPhone 4s though.Added 9/01/2013:I'm going to take this into an Apple store to see if it's always been defective. We literally can't do much on this without a long lag time. My daughter has taken to playing her games on my iPhone. She is very frustrated. Apps crash a lot too that do not crash on my iPhone. It took me 10 minutes to do a task on her iPod that took me one minute to do on mine.
4	1356048000	Pros:I have the 8gb black version, and I must say that I'm pleased. It's a beautiful piece of technology, runs fast, and it does A LOT. Its pocket size makes it really convenient as well. whether I'm storing and sharing files via dropbox, surfing the internet, reading books on kindle, using it as a camera/Facetime, dictionary, or just listening to music as it originally was intended, it executes all things very well. the battery life is also fairly good. The wifi connection is also powerful as well. It's not even a music player anymore - it's an entire computer in your pocket!Cons:Hard drive space. it's not actually 8gb as advertised. Mine comes out to be only 6.43, and that's WITHOUT iOs5 onboard. Come on Apple, you can at least be honest and tell me it's going to be less than that!price for peripherals and accessories. $200 is actually a fair price for what you pay to have a pocket computer in your hand, but all of its peripherals & accessories begin to add up over time.fragility. It slipped out of my pocket and the screen cracked. Fortunately everything still works minus the aesthetics, but man, for the price you pay, i'd at least hope that Apple would have researched & developed a tougher body.Bottom line: get it. but make sure you invest in a GOOD, STURDY case.
5	1356048000	As I said in the title... I love Apple products.  Bought this one for my daughter's birthday.  She was very happy with it.
5	1356048000	My son is so happy with this iPod. It arrived in perfect condition with the exception of a small scratch on the back. The screen was perfect and the scratch doesn't matter because he keeps a case on it at all times.I am very happy with this.
4	1356048000	I love the iPod touch. This one was indeed new, in the proper packaging.  Unfortunately the home button started to malfunction after 3 months. But true to reputation, Apple store associates (Columbia, MD) honored the warranty by giving a replacement within minutes of seeing the malfunction in action.  Thank you Apple!
4	1355961600	This is a nice iPod.  It is fast and has a good camera and video camera, plus a music recorder.  My son is not allowed to use it yet, however, because it has the ability to go online.
1	1355961600	It took almost a month to receive this ipod when I finally got it it was covered in scratches it didn't come with a charger or head phone so after buying those I could of bought a brand new one! Very disappointed.
5	1355961600	I love this iPod touch so much that I bought one for my husband and one for my two year old son. We all have our noses buried in our iPods.
5	1355875200	what a great product! so much to do on it. Lots of entertainment with lots to do with it. excellent!
5	1355875200	Love it, I steal it from my son all the time! I definitely wish I bought one for myself.  I suggest a hard shell case for it.
5	1355875200	The iPod is in great condition and compares nicely against brand new iPods. The iPod is quick and easy to use. My son loves it!
5	1355875200	Well this is what my Grandson wanted I hope everything is working when he opens it I just wish you will ship the case for it that I bought
5	1355788800	perfect gift idea for my teenagers - kept them busy and out of my hair so i could cook on christmas morning
3	1355788800	its an apple product, works fine. thing i dont like about it is that you cant use it as a storage device like you could with the nano nor can you use it as an FM radio like the older ipods. i got the white one because it was cheaper. works fine though
5	1355788800	Brand new and works as expected, daughter loved it. The packaging could have been a bit better, but no harm was done.
4	1355788800	No real issues. It came as described and works fine. It was a Christmas gift for a 10 year old girl so haven't got to see it used too much yet. It did work fine when I was testing it after receiving. It arrived on time as well. I think it is a great little device. I do wish it was a little cheaper and was sad when I saw same item brand new advertised at same price on a Black Friday sale, but overall I am satisfied.
1	1355788800	WAS A BDAY GIFT FOR MY 16 YEAR OLD, THE DAY HE RECIEVED IT HE DROPPED IT AND SHATTERED THE FRONT.WE HAD CASE ON IT, BUT IT DIDNT STOP THE DAMAGE.. THE PRICE TO REPAIR WAS CRAZY, CHEAPER TO BUT NEW ONE WITH PLASTIC COVER.
5	1355788800	Came in a secure case and as described. I unfortunately had to return it but not due to any defects or misdescribed features by the seller. The return was very easy and the seller immediately refunded my account after receiving the product. Very happy with the seller and would def buy from them again.
1	1355788800	The bottom of the screen is broken and I wasn't notified of that problem.  It was a gift for my nephew who lives far away and I can't understand if there is a return process or how to do it.  This is the first time I've bought something used from the internet.  Bad experience and won't be doing that again.
4	1355702400	Not sure what we would get with a re-conditioned model.Ipod has very small scratches from normal wear.A case will cover and it will look new. Arrived on time.
5	1355702400	This is a great devise.  We got it for our son for Christmas.  It is something that he can use to communicate with friends and family, use for entertainment, and connect to the internet to find things to help him with his school work.
5	1355702400	I am happy with customer service they were very helpful with getting the issue corrected promptly. I will purchase from the company again.
1	1355702400	I bought it used they said it was in excellent conditions but it's. The. Worst electronic device. I have ever bought it only worked for three. Months
4	1355702400	So far so good.... The item was just as described.  I set it up through Apple and wrapped it as a gift.  It seems to work just fine.
5	1355616000	This iPod came on time and I like that it worked and I was able to get it set up quick and easy.
4	1355616000	I really love the inherent quality of anything Apple, and the ipod is no exception. However, these newer models of ipod have SIGNIFICANTLY less memory than the original versions.  Only about 6.4 GB is available for music (about 200 songs per GB).
5	1355616000	Does what it is suppose to do!! Good price and works great for my ipod. Reasonable price and it is a good product.
5	1355616000	I have been wanting one for a long time and finaly got one and I am glad I did.  if you are looking get one
4	1355529600	It does exactly what you expect it to do. Now, if only it could do it cheaper. The hardware is great, but I stil think iTunes is a bloated complicated mess.
5	1355529600	Purchased the black model as a gift for my brother.  He was ecstatic after receiving this.  So I am very well satisfied with this product
5	1355529600	nice way to venture into the world of Apple without breaking the bank - probably will want to upgrade -
5	1355529600	In a day and age of youth and electronics, this was the perfect gift at a resonable price for young grandchildren.
5	1355529600	In a day and age of youth and electronics, this was the perfect gift at a resonable price for young grandchildren.
5	1355443200	I purchased two of these for my two younger children.  They love them.  Games are usually free or 99 cents and they can get tons of games for the price of one PS3 game.  They mostly listen to music and play games (and text) on these.  I highly recommend any Apple product.  Very easy to use, high quality item.
1	1355443200	Not happy. Will not order again, if fact I will not refer either. It's depressing money that was spent for a product that doesn't work
2	1355356800	I only download free apps on my ipod and my iPad . apple charged my credit card for some old FREE apps . I contested the charges and won. The credit card removed the charges.  Now,that Jobs is gone ,this is what they did,disabled my id,so i cannot get updates for my iPad.ipod touch,nor my macbook air.--Like a four year child would do they block ever attempt to reset my id. So,i am paid up on my iCloud service .but i am not allowed to use it.  All because i would not let them steal my money.
5	1355270400	Typical Apple product, well made.  Very decent gifts for teenagers.I would like to see the company made more color and bigger size for choices.
5	1355184000	It is a great product. good packaging, good price,absolutely, I recommend it. . . . . . . . .
4	1355184000	unable to watch netflix on this device. The head phones did not work. everything else was fine. take great pictures
5	1355184000	I had an issue where my son's iPod was lost in the mail and they took care of it and resent another one.
3	1355184000	Just what was listed. Great. In the future I would probably opt for more memory as he has to delete apps to load new ones at this point but he uses it to play mostly games.
3	1355184000	BLah Blah Blah.....This is a good Ipod that my daughter loves..alot of good apps and features. again Blah Blah Blah
5	1355184000	I chose this rating because I think it really deserves the item and the seller. I really liked the article, was what I saw and what is written in such. Yes, I recommend it because it really is very good article
3	1355097600	But if you are a pc user, you will havesome headaches traying to share archivesbetween devices.I use it for recording interviews, but theni couldn't savi the recording files tu my pc.(i think it hace the same behavior on mac)
4	1355097600	This is an adequate item.First, it was very good but after a while, this lags a lot and keeps crashing on the programs such as some of the apps, picture, texting, and safari.
5	1355011200	Came in original package in great codition with all the parts dexcribed. She loves it. Has added all the apps
5	1355011200	I love all the Apple products, computers, iPad, etc. and my kids love the iPod for music, games, to communicate with their friends.
5	1355011200	Excatly what I wanted. The iPod seams brand new or hardly used, including cable within days at my house. Great service live it
2	1355011200	I ordered this so I can have for my music and stuff. I wasnt what I was looking I wasnt about to sign up for Iturns just to reorder all my music.
4	1355011200	Exactly what I was looking for; the packaging was very good and working perfectly; I would recommend to my friends
5	1355011200	Got this at a significant discount -like new except for scratches on back -new cover took care of that and the screen and all the fuctions are like new!  GREAT FOR KIDS!  LOVE IT!
5	1354924800	ABSOLUTLY LOVED THE PRICE, WAS HERE QUICKLY, BUT MAKE SURE TO BUY A SOFT COVER IF BUYING FOR A YOUNGER ONE, CAUSE MY SON DROPPED IT ON CARPET & THE SCREEN STILL CRACKED.
5	1354838400	Although I wished it was for me, it wasn't. I gave it as a birthday gift & she looooves it!
5	1354838400	I love it!! Never been disappointed :) !!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
5	1354838400	This is a great iPod.  I would recommend this for any kids. This is also a great gift. But I would get a hard case like an otter box. It could shatter easily. charges very fast.
5	1354838400	Good quality product. I recommend Beautifully presented and works perfectly. I expected when I thought about buying this product. Good
5	1354752000	I bought this iPod refurbished, and was worried that it wouldn't work as fast as a band new iPod. But it works great! :D I use it a lot for Facebook, and Text+ because I don't have a cell phone so, I use my iPod for texting and music and such. The only thing I don't really like is that, my home button seems to be laggy or takes me a billion times for the button to finally tell my iPod I'm pressing the button to unlock my iPod! But I think that's a problem a lot of iPods have..
5	1354752000	it was so exiciting getting it, i got it in time and everything was perfect, i use my ipod every single day of my life
5	1354665600	We were so excited to have found this at such a great price. We love everything about it. I was looking for something else that holds more music.
5	1354665600	My grandson uses it all the time. Used the camera when he went to New York city and at the beach.
4	1354665600	I JUST bought this but now it's the old model...oh well.I like it, but it seems to have significantly more problems than my iPhone4s. It freezes and has other problems and I have to reset sometimes...almost like a Windows product (gasp!). But, I do like the fact that it is smaller and lighter than the iPhone. A good product but from now on I will probably just get the iPhone models and skip the iPods...The chrome back scratches if you look at it wrong so get a case.
5	1354665600	im not a big apple guy, but i was very happy with this ipod touch. i enjoy the safari browser and the access it give me to my AMAZON CLOUD
4	1354579200	i bought this as a gift for my 19 year old brother. he loves it. only thing is that he can't use all apps for free - but that's nothing new with apple!
5	1354579200	My daughter saved up to buy this.  She loves it.  It arrived super fast and it is so easy for her to use.  It took us a little while to set it up but it's great ever since.  Holds tons of songs and sounds great.
5	1354579200	We bought this as a birthday present for our grandson who has autism. He LOVES his iPod and carries it around with him every where. It is very important for him to interact with people and this gives him something to interact with his friends. This is a wonderful product and at a great price!!!!! It even arrived early. Thank you so much!!!!!
5	1354579200	I love my iPod touch so much, you can do alot of stuff on this beside listening to music. You can download music, apps, games, movies, magazine and pictures. The ipod touch has a build in camera and camcorder, the camera is also reversible. So you can take pictures and video on the good and you will never miss out if something is taking place on the spot. As long as you have wifi you can access the internet. You can access facebook, utube, google, yahoo, macy's, kohl, saks and  any social media sites you choose to. There is only two things I don't like about this ipod touch:1. It is to heavy2. When you plug your ipod to the computer, sometimes it take 2 mins before it start to charge. So people please don't be fool and keep unplugging it and plugging it back, just leave it plug in, it will eventually charge.So I say buy it because  you will love it and it is a good christmas present for 6 year old and a 80 year old.
5	1354579200	MY SON BOUGHT THIS FOR HIMSELF AND TRAINED HIMSELF TO USE IT.NOT BAD FOR A 9 YEAR OLD.  I AM ILLITERATE WITH COMPUTORS, SO IT WORKED FOR HIM
5	1354579200	my grand daughter loved her IPOD, loaded it up with her favsongs and still listening to them...more space left to fill
1	1354492800	I purched this ipod from amazomfor her birthday the first seller after three days told me it was out of stock so i had to re order from another company shipping was slow she dident get it for her birthday afier recieving it she had it for six weeks she got a message from the preveous ower that he had tracked it on his computer and that it had been stollen from his house so he disarmed it and nobody seams to want to help me with this problem including amazon verry pissed off custemer
5	1354492800	The ipod came in the mail very fast, it was in good shape and works really well. I'm very pleased with this product.
5	1354406400	Sound quality is great! songs load up quickly! and many features to keep my fun alive! Worth it all! GET IT!
5	1354406400	I have been using this ipod more than my blackberry phone. its a great device for apps, music, and entertainment. very slim and elegant.
4	1354406400	I love this upgrade.  The apps and cameras are great.  Good value for the money.  I didn't care for the white but you can cover that.
5	1354320000	I bought my iPod a few months ago and I have loved it ever since. Although I have tried to crop some photos and it will reboot, but other than that it is an awesome product. I was frustrated that they came out with the 5th generation right after I bought my 4th generation, but that has nothing to do with the performance of the iPod. I would definitely recommend it.
5	1354320000	I love this ipod. It is one of my daughter's favorite gift ever. And I got it with a very great price. Thanks Amazon for always having such great electronics, at such an awesome price!!!!
4	1354320000	Got it for my sister as her replacement for the old touch model, this touch is very solid for the price and does many functions an iPhone would do. Skype, 3d games and anything in-between, one exception it doesn't support siri without a hack.
5	1354233600	I gave this Itouch to my 21 year old as a gift.  She is on a limited, just-starting-out, budget so doesn't have an IPhone but uses this instead, it has many similar features and she is very satisfied.  No problems, she is thrilled!
5	1354233600	My son bought this for his daughter for Christmas - She absolutely loves it - A great Christmas gift for sure
5	1354233600	muy contenta con mi compra y como todo lo de APPLE es muy bueno y una buena forma de trasladar musica co uno
5	1354233600	My granddaughter loves her iPod.  You know how teenage kids are always doing something on computers.She said it is very easy to use.
5	1354233600	this was birthday gift for my daughter, it came in very good condition just as described with all of it's contents I would say it was a great deal
4	1354233600	A replacement for her recently lost iPod. It's an Apple product, which I'm not a big fan of but works for her.
5	1354233600	I purchase my iPod a few weeks ago and to tell you the truth is amazing,Insanely awesome and very useful. If I tell you it was a waste of money I'll be lying to you. Thank you amazon
5	1354060800	I bought this ipod as a gift to a young teenage girl and asked her to let me know if she liked it. I must say that she was so excited that the next day she called to let me know that she not only liked it but loved it. So I guess that I have to trust her on it.
5	1354060800	The item arrived as advertised and works like a charm. I would recommend buying a refurbished IPod unless you want the newest version.
5	1354060800	mil gracias excelente producto y ustedes muy eficientes en sus entrega gracias por todo saludos desde venezuela espero se guir contando con ustedses
5	1354060800	The product it's excelent, the ipod arrived in the best conditions, and it came to my country really fast.I haven't had any problem with it. I truly recommend it!!!!
5	1353974400	She has wanted on for a long time and she can play games, listen to music, text and she loves it
5	1353974400	I purchased this iPod and have loved having such a handy piece of technology in my pocket!! Looking back, I'd wished I'd spent a little more and gotten the biggest GB that Apple offered. 8GB is great, but if you want unlimited pictures, music and games/apps...DO NOT get 8GB!! Get the bigger size...32GB. It's worth the extra!!The iPod works great, functions well and has been a beneficial tool for me to use!! A great gift!!
5	1353974400	Product looks great and works great. Would definitely buy from again! Thanks! My kids will be so happy I got these for them for Xmas!
5	1353974400	We ordered this for a prize give-away and the winner was very happy.  He had been wanting one for some time.
5	1353974400	I bought this for my husband because we all have one at home and he was jealous!! he just loves it. you can even get your email with this one although the screen is small it is big enough to read. thanks again to Amazon.com for another great priced item..we are very happy we shopped here..Thanx!!! Linda Sue
3	1353888000	The iPod arrived in good conditions with all the accessories that were written, just for the record, you might want to double check for conditions of packaging, because although it arrived safely, the product became without the original package and just a little more wearied out than it said. But overall its a good product.
3	1353888000	It was okay. Almost everything works as usual except for one part of the touch screen which is unusable. It does not respond to any touches. This made it harder to play certain games. Some games you can flip the screen, but some are fixed so it effects your gameplay.
5	1353801600	I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them. thanks
5	1353801600	Exactly what I wanted and more! I bought this as a gift for my little brother and he loves it! I might just get one for myself!
4	1353715200	I purchased this iPod about a year ago and was very happy with the fast shipping. I received the iPod in a day after ordering it and selecting 2 day shipping. I had previously owned the 3rd generation iPod Touch and was ready for an upgrade on speed and features, especially the camera. I was very satisfied with the quality of the device and the screen resolution. Definitely a step up from the 3rd generation. After a while the iPod's performance decreased slightly and after dropping it several times and cracking the screen a few times, the speed and quality of the iPod has immensely decreased. It takes it about 2 minutes to load a YouTube video. But I do have to say that it loads Netflix movies very well and I have never had a problem with Netflix. Maybe it is just YouTube being stubborn but I think it is mostly my old iPod being old. I am planning to purchase the new iPod Touch 5th Generation soon after the holidays (because I have to spend the majority of my saved money on Christmas, anniversary, valentine's day, and birthday presents. So I am putting that iPod off for now). If this is your first iPod Touch, you will be impressed with its screen quality, speed, performance, and other features. If you have owned any previous versions of the iPod Touch, you will be amazed with this device. The camera is a bit cheap, being only 1 megapixel. The front facing camera is awful, being only .3 megapixel VGA camera. After a few months, the picture quality drops drastically. That might be because I jail-broke it so many times and I've dropped it too many times to count. But overall, if you take good care of this device it will be a really good investment. Though I have hands-on experience with the iPod Touch 5th generation and definitely recommend that one over this one. It has a way better and bigger screen. One of my favorite things about the new screen is it doesn't lost it's color at certain angles. This iPod's display will get more saturated if you look at it at a certain angle. I recommend this device to somebody that is not looking for anything too fancy, but looking for high speed browsing and a cheap little camera. Oh and one more thing, the steel backing on this iPod will get VERY scratched up. When you first get it, you can see your reflection really well, but after about 2 months, you can barely tell it used to look nice. They fixed that problem with the iPod Touch 5th gen by replacing the steel backing with an aluminum uni body with a nice anodized finish.
5	1353715200	I LOVE the iPod touch 4th generation, but if you want really good packaging you should probably but from the apple store, the pack em really well. That's where I got mine :)
5	1353628800	This is still an amazing product with wifi and the sleek body and tons of apps you can't go wrong. Touch screen is the best technology they gurus have came out with, you never have to worry about buttons getting jammed or gunk getting stuck underneath. You can use the ipod for organization, surfing the web, or just playing games or listening to music. With this product you can not go wrong. I would recommend everyone should have one
4	1353628800	Item was what I expected.  The only issue was with the sync cable and the vendor replaced the cable with no hassles.
5	1353628800	I ordered this product after breaking my old ipod of 4 years and this is just what i wanted although it does have so issue it is not related to the product it is related to Apple and software. Got this for 150$ refurbished and it looked bran new! no scratches or anything, received this product within a week and a half so shipping was as intended. 10/10!
4	1353628800	is in good conditions is almost like a new one is beutiful is not tu expensive it.Apple iPod touch 16GB White (4th Generation) CURRENT MODELis interestin goood.
5	1353628800	I love everything about my ipod! It's sleek, the apps are great, and I even use it instead of a phone.The only complaint is the picture quality. Could be better.
5	1353542400	This apple ipod touch 4th Generation black has a slight body and is very fast at the touch of the finger and moves through the different options and apps with easy. The internet browser is very fast and handles the internet very well. Instant messaging and web browsing, and email is very easy to use and also the ipod players your mp3 very good as well.The only problen I have is the apple ipod touch 4 battery drains very fast and that is kind of inconvenience.But overall I give it 4 out of 5 starsThanks keep up the good work apple
5	1353456000	I bought this for my friend for his birthday and he has really enjoyed using it. We FaceTime on it everyday!
1	1353456000	The giant, hyper-fragile pane of glass at the front is this item's Achille's heel, as it's about 1/4 larger than the actual screen, and fixing that would prevent almost every broken iPhone and iPod Touch out there. Unfortunately, building a durable product simply isn't profitable.The device is extremely underpowered. The apps crash all the time because the processor is made of saltines and is stuck together with chewed bubble gum. When they DO run, they chug. And then they crash. They always crash.The App store is incredibly limited, as Apple is keeping a tight grip over it. This excludes huge amounts of excellent content that we as users should have access to should we so choose. Of course you can jailbreak it, but the fact that the product is explicitly designed to prevent users from picking their own content is a massive middle finger in the face of anyone unfortunate enough to buy this unbelievably expensive piece of junk.Buy a Galaxy Player. They're cheaper, are comprised of better hardware, and Samsung (and the Android store) understands the concept of a person owning something they've paid for.Samsung 3.6-Inch Galaxy Player
5	1353369600	only one thing i can say bad (if you'd call it that) i wish i coulda shoulda woulda waited for a 16 or 32gb. I mean, It's flawless, but i needs me some mo' memoreh!
5	1353369600	I am very pleased with this device. It is way way faster than my last ipod(3rd gen). The wifi seems faster to me. I can also finally get all the games I wanted that I couldn't on the last one. You should get this or the newer one just wait for them to be on a good deal.
5	1353369600	Item in perfect condition, well worth the money. This is to be a gift for Christmas. Good buy. Would refer to anyone.
5	1353369600	My older children wanted an iPod for the past couple of years, and I was hesitant.  However, now that they are older (15 and 12) I decided to keep an eye out for deals on iPod's to get them for the holidays for them.  Amazon had a great deal of iPod w/ a started accessory bundle (came w/ protective case, wallet, screen protectors and stylus) for $175.  Since I'm not a black friday shopper for big items, I knew the chances of finding a better deal would be slim so I ordered 2 bundle sets.  I charged the iPod's to make sure they work and they seem to be perfect for my kids.  Definitely worked out good all around I guess.
5	1353369600	Was very impressed with this product!!! Shipped quickly and was very clean with minimal wear.  Better than I expected for the price!
5	1353369600	Love it. I bought it for my granddaughter and I almost kept it for myself. The graphics are awesome and is easy to use.
3	1353369600	Dont buy 8 GB for Ipod-phone products, when you download the first 4-5 apps, you only have like 4 GB for music only. 8 GB on this product is like a car with 3 sits... You can invite a friend but he cannot bring his girlfriend
5	1353283200	So far this iPod has been great, there was barely any dents or scratches on it. It will be a great gift for my daughter
2	1353283200	I bought this to take on a 5-week trip to South America. It worked well, until I set it down (not slammed, or dropped) on a table. When I picked it up again, the entire front was cracked all over. It's still functional, but seriously, it should be able to survive being set down.
4	1353196800	I recently purchased this iPod for my boyfriend's birthday.  It shipped the day after I ordered it, and I received it two days later.  The only thing that he doesn't like about it was that it wouldn't work when he plugged it into the port in his car.  We had to purchase a different cord.
5	1353110400	This is the second one I have brought for my grandkids. They are great fun and easy to use. Downloading music is easy, even for grandma. The kids can email, text (with an app) take photos and play games. They are a little pricey, but there is no cost for a monthly cell phone-they can text using their cable wifi. None of us have used up the 8GB of memory yet.
1	1353024000	First off they took my money, and sent me broken, damaged goods. They sent me something I never ordered!! Dont use them ever again.
5	1353024000	ok so my cousin got this for christmass last year and it is amazing! i have it on my christmass list this year and i'm praying to God that i get it. i hope that it can get skype but if not i can make do with face time. that is all.
4	1353024000	Nice &iacute;tem, however is was not clear it had headset and wall charger. Anyway it covered the expectations and the goal to replace an old one
5	1352937600	I would recommend this product to anyone young and old. Very sturdy and easy to use. My wife really enjoys it.
4	1352937600	I Chose 4 Starts Because It Did Arrive On Time And In Perfect Condition But My iPod Is A Bit Slow And I Don't Have Much Or Use It That Much. I Got It Because I Like To Listen To Music While I'm In School But That's About The Only Time I Use It And Its Slow I Don't Know Why But Other Than That Everything Else Is Good :)
4	1352851200	Was amazing at first then soon after home button  stopped working. Really disappointed with this product. Want a replacement soon.
5	1352851200	I think it's an excellent product, is a very good buy because it meets all my expectations. Highly recommended. Thanks
5	1352851200	My family and I are quickly becoming big fans of Apple products.  This Ipod was bought for my 13 year old son and he's loving it.  The camera function is great and there are so many apps to have fun with!!
5	1352851200	this is exactly what my daughter wanted, and she loves it...would order it again if my other daughter wants this
5	1352764800	This is an amazing piece of tech, I'm not sure what else to say. Today's young folks are so fortunate to have an understanding of these machines, even us more mature users can get a lot of enjoyment from working with this technology. Seems boundless!
5	1352764800	I loved it I love it, the package arrived in very good condition and well packaged, arrived in the time specified recommend it, I love very much my article, works perfectly is the best I've bought on Amazonthanks
4	1352764800	There was only one thing wrong with it.  a small dent in the back and scratches.  but put a case on and BAM! brand new!  It was reset so its like factory good.  I think the battery may be a little old but it may also just be iPod 4's do that.
5	1352764800	I love my iPod touch!It never freezes up, easy to work, and of course the graphics are fantastic because of the Retina Display.
5	1352764800	Gift for my son, he loves it. wifi in our house and has all his music on it and plays it all the time.
5	1352678400	best thing I ever bought the kids when the grandkids are here you can hear a rock it is sooooooooooooooo nice
5	1352678400	I like to use my iPod all the time for utilities. It is very fast and is good for listening to music. I, myself do not see any problems, I see comments of people saying its fragile. This is not true, if you handle it like a normal person. Because of the thing being so thin, I have dropped it quite a few times but has seemed to hold up with NO cracks to the screen or back! However, I did notice that the back did scratch quite easily and I accidentally made two little dents in the back from having it in my back pocket. But the screen is perfect, I got a $1 set of screen protectors just in case, but it was still fine without them.
5	1352678400	It exactly what it says as in the description box. when I got it-it was in excellent condition. I can get all the apps just like a iPhone and I can connect to any wi-fi with ease.
4	1352592000	Item more or less exactly as described, well packaged...albeit not in the most attractive or comforting containers...but done is such a way as to not arouse suspicion...I did pay just a hair more for what I thought was two day shipping...but took say, five days to get here...not a real big deal...as again, I didn't pay much more...but was the only thing off in the exchange. Would do business w/these guys again.
3	1352592000	I bought the 8 GB iTouch for my 7 and 10 year old grandchildren.  The LOVE them, for playing games and watching TV and taking pictures.  Then they tried to download a movie from iTunes to watch on the plane when they came to visit me.  NO LUCK!  iTunes would only allow them to download movies in HD, no option to download in SD (unless they did it to a computer first, which they couldn't because they weren't at home).  Even with less than 300 songs, 3 games, and no pictures loaded on the iTouch, there was not enough memory available for even 1 movie!  VERY disappointed.  Had I known how much memory was actually going to be AVAILABLE (not enough), I would have bought the 16 GB.
5	1352505600	My son wanted an iPhone but is still very young and we didn't want the extra monthly payment. This was the next best thing. He gets to play all the games he wants and isn't asking to play with everyone else's phone anymore. This was the perfect gift for him. We are very pleased.
4	1352332800	I was wanting to hop on the computer to check my email or to do other things, but it was already was being used. When I got the ipod touch4 I was able to go on the internet. So now when someone else was using the computer I was able to do my thing on the I pod touch. You can fit the I pod in your pocket so you can take it wherever you go. The I pod touch4 is black, it is touchscreen, it's pretty light, and it feels smooth. You can choose what you want as your wallpaper on it, and you also can have a pass code on it so no one could get into it. You can also buy a case for it and a screen protector. I love it how I can face time and contact my friends, play games, and listen to music. I just don't enjoy how you have to have wifi to do some things on it. Also if you drop it a lot the screen can crack. Overall it is fun to have an I pod touch 4. if you enjoy playing games, going on the internet, contacting your friends, or like to listen to music then the I pod touch 4 is for you.
5	1352246400	Greetings, excellent product purchase without any inconvenience, in good and perfect conditions, the product color selected, 100% responsible, I recommend it.
4	1352160000	I am enjoying the product that I purchased. I did receive the white Ipod instead of the black one that I had purchased. The shipping was ok but I didn't receive it until 8pm in the evening because UPS didn't load it on the truck. It wasn't the sellers fault so don't hold that against them. The product was in very good condition with minimal scratches and it has been a very good product so far. This was a birthday present for my 8 year old daughter and she loves it!
5	1352160000	This is one of the best purchases you could ever want to buyit has games, messaging and it has voice control (not siri).
5	1352160000	Very nice and slick! Love it! Much better picture than the previous generations. The camera take awesome pictures and the best is that you can edit them.
5	1352160000	Bought one for a birthday gift and after playing with it had to have one myself. Happy with everything about it.would recomend it to anyone
2	1352073600	I was very disappointed with this purchase. The screen was one big crack. I needed a screen that I could look at to make choices from a list. I can not do this with this purchase.
1	1352073600	I do not like this product for these reasons.1)This product starts to spaz out as soon as you start to use it.2)I got mine for $200 and the next week the price goes down to $114.3)When ever I use my key pad it starts to do double tap letters and when I erase, it erases everything insted of only one letter.4)When I use the app center it workes for ten seconds (I've counted) and then exits out.5)it will some times zoom in on my screen a little bit for no appernt reason.
4	1351987200	I love this new iPod. This is impart due to the apps I can now get that weren't compatible with my old iPod.One caveat. I would highly consider getting the 16GB. I seemed to fill this one up much more quickly then my previous iPod!
1	1351900800	Walk with it in your pocketBreathe while you carry itOr move it.I purchased mine so I could listen to music while I walk my dog.  As I walk with it in my pocket or holding it in my hand, it constantly skips, moves forward to the next song, or pauses.If you want to listen to music sitting perfectly still than this is the item for you.  Otherwise I would recommend something else as I have various music devices in my house for that.
5	1351900800	A great great ipod. I don't have to buy music, I have internet and listen to pandora alot. I love it and my oldest grandson loves the games.
4	1351814400	The provider I used sent me a good hardly ever used ipod touch 8 gig (4th gen) and it is excellent.... No issues to report... looked damn near brand new when I got it , and has worked well ever since.
5	1351814400	I gave this as a gift to my son. I have heard that he was very very pleased with it.Apple iPod touch 8GB Black (4th Generation) CURRENT MODEL
5	1351728000	This ipod is great for music, games, web, email and videos. The only setback is the 8gb of memory. I sold my old 8gb and I'm upgrading to the 32gb.Update 11/13/12Just received the 32gb from amazon super fast shipping for free. All the goodness of the 8gb but more memory to fit games and music. ALso the 32gb does not freeze as much as the 8gb not that the 8gb froze a lot. The performance just feels better
5	1351728000	I bought this for my little sisters 15th birthday and she loves it! She says it works great, has long battery and great apps.
5	1351641600	I got this ipod touch for my daughter's birthday.you can do so much in it,as much as iphone 5 you can download all the apps you want.plus a free call and text if you download the apps for it.It's very cute,and light.
5	1351641600	I love it! Just what I wanted. It performs well and does so much more than my older iPod touch.
5	1351555200	I love the iPod Touch. It is similar to the iPhone but thinner and without phone functions. I don't find the last thing a big flaw because nowadays people use less and less the standard phone and rely on apps instead. Just by having a Mifi router I am able to use the iPod Touch as a regular phone without having to pay crazy money.
1	1351555200	My ipod touch 4 started coming apart at the seam, literally.  The case is separating from itself like the glue isn't there.  It's never been dropped and has always been in a case, so I don't know what the problem is.  Looks like a manufacturing defect.  I just looked up the return policy and it expired just a little over a month after i bought it.  $189 down the tube!  It is also starting to give me errors when I download, which I think has to do with the case coming loose and the inside not being secure (I'm no expert, so sorry if that's in layman's terms).So disappointing!  I just bought my daughter an ipod last month because this one was so fun, but I purchased it from an Apple store.  Thank goodness!  Now if that one comes apart I can take it to them free of charge.  You have been warned!
5	1351468800	This was a great birthday gift for my 11 year old daughter, because I could not see paying for a brand new one that might get lost or broken. I will definetely be buying more products like this in the future. I was very pleased.
5	1351468800	I bought one to test for my grand children.  I will be getting the rest of them one also now.  8 and 10 year old passed it.
4	1351468800	I cant go anywhere without my ipod. Gotta have music with me at all times. if youre thinking about getting this I would highly recommend it over any other mp3 device from another brand.
5	1351382400	I love the Ipod touch 4th generation!First it is fast, but at times it is slow which isn't a big problem to me.It has great display and the pictures come out great in good lighting.It comes with the built in Youtube app which is great and if you watch it on a low brightness setting you can get away with watching it for a couple hours.If you don't have a case for this the back metal part will get SUPER scratched which is a big problem. I recommend that before you get this product you buy a case for it and a screen protector. Mine will not let me download the IOS6 which is bothering me. If you don't have wifi it is very hard to use this because you can't text, FaceTime, view some apps, or watch YouTube. I wish it had Siri, but unfortunately it does not. Overall, I do recommend this product. :)
5	1351209600	Great product at a great price. High technology product, I am very satisfied with it. Perfect for music, games, wifi, and easy to use. Very nice colour. Easy to use it and is one of my Apple products.
5	1351209600	I bought the Apple ipod touch for my son's birthday last month. He absolutely loves it! He said it is easy to use, and it is very useful not only for entertainment purposes, it helps him in his classes at college, as he is a music major. Sound is clear, easy to use, easy to purchase other accessories for if needed. He is pretty pleased with it.
5	1351209600	Everything as expected. with no tax or shipping charges.I bought a no-name and it worked well but having an IPOD allows you to purchase many attachment everywhere. Big advantage when thinking about what to buy.
4	1351209600	The only negative thing about the 8gb is you can't download movies, not enough space i guess. However, if you have Netflix and internet you can stream movies.  So if that is important to you, i would get the 16gb.
2	1351123200	Firstly, my complaint has nothing to do with performance.  I'm sure it would work great with internet if I could connect to it.  The music works, but if all I wanted was music I would have bought the nano.  Unfortunately I don't have a router at home.  My internet is wireless through wimax and I own a dell inspiron which is incompatible with clearwire's clear spot router (which only works for ipod).  Little advice, if you don't use a router like me, don't bother buying this product. Save a little money and buy a nano instead.  Apple, you need to improve your product.
4	1351036800	I was excited to get my iPod. It shipped early and I got it pretty fast. It worked very well until I went to turn the screen off with the power button and it wouldn't work and then the volume buttons on the side didn't work either. This doesn't bother me much since I have the assistive touch button in the corner of my screen allowing me to lock the screen and control the volume. Other then these 2 flaws, I LOVE the product.
3	1351036800	I purchased this in December of 2011. today is October 24, 2012. Not even a year later and the camera does not work properly. The screen will not open up, it is blank and on Shuffle it continues to play the same song over and over and over again without switching.My husband has a microsoft mp3 player that he has had for about 6 or 8 years now and it still works perfectly. It is not a touch screen but it works.
5	1350950400	I bought this for my wife last year for her birthday. I could not complain about the shipping at all of the product. When she opened the box and saw what it was it was really neat to see her so excited about it.  Also for Christmas last year, my wife and her siblings pulled together and bought one for their dad.  His face lit up like Gambit's cards right before he throws them at someone.  The product is good for organization, planning, entertainment, and communication. After a year my wife's iPod still is working as great as the day it was delivered to the house.  Of course, the only complaint I can really come up with is it certainly could use more space.  They have iPods with a bigger hard drive, it is just a matter of saving up the money to buy an iPod with a bigger hard drive.
2	1350950400	The product itself was physically nice however the iPod has to be charged so often. I would recommend checking the small details before making an online purchase.
5	1350950400	I love this IPOD. I use it all the time. It does everything. Here are some of the things I use it for with the free Itunes applications installed on Wifi:Select grocery items to purchase at store and get coupons for themUse exercise weight program with pictures on how to lift the weights and keep track of how much liftedUse the weight management program to track eating and weight lossTake pictures and make videosCheck my e-mailSearch for restaurant ratingsCheck for movies playingTalk on Face TimeText messaging on Face timeListen to musicWatch you-Tube videosWatch moviesSurf the internet.......and so much moreThe one thing that I wish was different was a bigger screen and that it would still fit in my purse. I believe they have a new one out that is a little bigger.
2	1350864000	Too many extras. Not worth it if all you want is a music player. Waaaaay overboard on the frills. Totally unnecessary IMO. All your paying for is a bunch of extra crap you may never use. It's more like a smart phone than a music player. If all you want it to be able to play .mp3s vids etc, seriously consider something else, because this isn't worth the money if that's really all you want. If you want a smart phone, then go buy a smart phone. If what you want is just a music player, then buy something else.
5	1350864000	I bought this iPOD as a replacement for the one my daughter managed to misplace.  I paid $199 plus tax for her last iPOD and was suprised to have paid only $175 and NO tax or shipping and handling for the replacement.  The package arrived promptly.  Very happy with the product I received.
5	1350864000	I purchased the iPod touch because I did not have anything made by Apple and wanted to try it out.  I love IT!  It is a great purchase and holds so many apps and music for only 8G......
4	1350864000	My oldest daughter had been saving for over a year to get this, and it has been working great since it was opened.
5	1350691200	I don't like apple products, but this definitely does the job for what I want. The front camera is a nice touch.
1	1350691200	My father purchased this a few years ago maybe 1 1/2 and it's been well taken care of, no cracked screen updated and taken care off. Recently a portion of the screen stopped working so any applications on the far right side I can't access and out of the 8 gb I'm suppose to get I only get 5 gb so that sucks, the cord wears out really quick and a replacement cost 20 dollars because it's proprietary. My music glitches as if it's a CD and the camera sometimes doesn't immediately respond, If you want something get a Samsung Galaxy 4.2 player with android atleast they make a good product. till I can buy a Samsung I'm using my old PSP 1001, I will never buy a apple product again, I hope they go under and collapse under there own arrogance, oh and don't update to 6.0 because the WIFI doesn't work sometimes and apple hasn't fixed it yet.
5	1350518400	Is a great product as all Apple electronics are, this was a gift for my 15 year old son and he is loving it.
3	1350432000	Unit was received in good condition but the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge for longer than 8 hours on music and far less time on video or games.
3	1350432000	I am an apple fanatic. The depressing part about this is that it requires a lot of money. That is a product that I do not have much of.My 64 GB iTouch 4 Gen broke over a year ago, and it sucked all the times I didn't have it. So, to stumble on this used set is awesome! However, you are getting what you pay for. Considering you can get a new replacement from apple for just 100 more, it's a pretty steep decision to make. I chose this route, and I'm not entirely sure whether I'm satisfied. It works fine, the screen is nice, no scuffs on it or anything; but I do notice that the processor is quite slower than what I remember. From time to time applications will close randomly without reason, and it is slow with internet and downloads. That being said, you probably shouldn't use it for your main device. I actually purchased a 4th Gen 16 GB nano (the watch-related products) before this one, and it works great for all my music listening needs. If you need something to use for instagram, twitter, and facebook integration, this is your product. It does that just fine. Everything else is a bit slow. It depends on what you're after!Here is a link to what I bought for music.Apple iPod nano 16 GB Graphite (6th Generation) OLD MODEL
5	1350345600	Bought this iPod for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.  It may not be the most up to date Apple model or technology, but for the price and for her needs it is terrific.
4	1350345600	The item pretty much met my expectations, the appearance was impecable, both screen and back. the only slight problem was that the battery doesn't last too long, maybe 12-15 hours, with medium use.
5	1350259200	Smaller than an IPad, don't need to worry about phone calls, can do almost anything that a net book can do.Only thing is it does not come with a charger, you'll have to plug in a computer with USB to charge the device. Thumbs down for that.Otherwise, thumbs up!
4	1350259200	My dad's old iPod just working a few months ago and he wanted another one. Therefore, he like my brother's iPod touch, so he looked around few stores. Then he looked online, and he liked the prices that he saw online. So he got a refurbished iPod touch like my little brother. So as soon as his iPod touch came in the mail, he fall in love with it. The iPod touch that he order from the is place was extacly as the seller said, and I beleive it came a day or two earlier as well.
5	1350172800	I'm a positive kid so I will rate this 5 starS :) good luck with you business... lol lol lol lol lol lol lol
4	1350086400	I'm pretty satisfied with the item. Works Great. Only problem is that the volume button on the side is a little sticky, but it still works. for now..
5	1350086400	Everything looks good....I received what I was expecting in the time that I was expecting, so far my experience was good, and I do recommend this vendor...
2	1350086400	Bought from Amazon. The headphone jack only put out mono sound. Fortunately I noticed the issue right away and was able to get a full replacement at the locoal Apple store. But, the hassle of replacing the iPod was just that... a hassle. Make sure to check the iPod for full functionality right when you get it. If you notice any issues, then head to your Apple store.
5	1350000000	These iPod s looked almost new normal wear and tear.  I hAd to upgrade one to os6 as the camera stopped working but this seems to have fixed it.  Can't beat the price and my kids love them
2	1349913600	The ipod did not come with the headphones or charger and the screen was cracked which was not in the description for this product. Very disappointed.
5	1349913600	I love it!!!! I got the 8 GB...and that's enough for me......There are so many apps, I'm having blast with it! It was sent in perfect condition, and came a lot sooner than expected. I purchased the brand new one, not the used or refurbished, from Amazon. I'm so pleased!!! It truly makes me wonder why did I wait this long to get it....it has just about everything, I've had it for a couple of weeks, and I'm still finding new things about it!!!! Its so nice to have I-tunes within reach..looool!! Its worth it! I love it...the battery goes out pretty quick but thats expected with the  Iphones/ Ipod! I really don't go anywhere without it!!! Great buy & worth it!!!!
5	1349827200	We received the order in a timely manner and it was in great condition.  My son is very happy with it and I lovethe fact that it has a 9 month warranty with it.  I would buy from this customer again.
5	1349827200	The product I received was exactly as ordered and I was pleased.  Shipping was fast and the product was ready to use.  First time using this process and glad that it worked well.
3	1349740800	If one is not an Apple user, as I am not. It took quite a while & some hard thinking to get it loaded with my music. Loading Kindle was a snap. That's as far as I have gotten thus far.
4	1349654400	I gave it a 4 star and I could of gave it a 5 stars but it sometime freezes on me which i really hate. other then that its a really good product.
5	1349654400	Apple ipod Generation Touch 4, met and exceeded our expectations.Apple ipod Generation Touch 4, met and exceeded our expectations.
5	1349654400	It is awesome! Thanks I do appreciate my new IPOD. It is one of the best for te price that I could have gotten.
5	1349568000	iPod Apple touch is wonderful it has met all my needs and then some :-) great work, looking forward to using constantly
4	1349568000	The product was is very good condition and the screen was fine,but when charging or listening the iPod gets very hot and a lot of my apps just randomly crash..
1	1349568000	Help! I ordered this for my 13 year old the device tells me after we get through all the set up that the device is not eligble for free icloud acct!
5	1349568000	The condition of this Ipod was as described.I would buy from this seller again.We are very happy with it.We wanted to Ipod 4 so it could handle the new IOS.It does and my son loves it.
5	1349568000	I like it i will recommend  the product to anyone. Apple has always  been aGood product for me . I have an iPhone and an iPad too.
5	1349568000	I bought this after a co-worker brought one into work, what sold me on it is the front and back camera. Video and camera is so crisp and clear, the music you can store on it and play back is amazing! It does exactly what I was looking for and am very happy I bought this. Before this purchase I have never used apple products whatsoever, I kept hearing how hard it is to navigate online but I found it to be quite the opposite. Apps are limitless and there is basically an app for pretty much anything. The one thing I don't like about it is that the camera does not zoom. I found an app for that, but was not too happy with the app so I deleted it. All in all I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy an mp3 player device with extras and wifi capabilities. A mini-computer that fits in your pocket that is what this is !
5	1349481600	This product is amazing! I get to have many apps and enjoy music. the only thing is that the camera isnt that good and I thought it would of had flash. other than that it was a pretty good investment.
5	1349481600	excelente producto, en perfectas condiciones me llego, lo recomiendo 100 porciento gracias, el ipod touch es uno de los mejores reproductores de musica en la actualidad con el IOS6 mucho mejor muchas gracias
1	1349395200	My music has mysteriously vanished after downloading iOS 6 software update. After the iPod advised me to backup my iPod since it hadn't been backed up in a month, I decided to plug it in to back it up. Then next morning I went to work and was shocked to see that only a handful of the artists that had been there before were on my iPod. 12 artists out of 500 artists is definitely something I notice.Spoke to an Apple Customer Service rep who was terrible and didn't know what she was talking about and didn't understand that I didn't want to have to restore my iPod or manually re-add the songs back to my iPod which would have taken a lifetime. I then spoke to a pompous know-it-all customer service rep who provided no help whatsoever other than telling me that nothing was wrong.I also went to visit a "Genius", but that guy was pompous too. He turned off iTunes Music Match because apparently that was part of the problem. He also turned off MacKeeper because he said it was running multiple anti-virus programs. Then, he decided to restore my iPod again except this time all the artists I selected became unchecked. Irritated, I thanked him for deleting my iPod music selection, which would take me another 15-20 minutes to reselect. Such a bad experience with Apple.So I spent Wednesday trying to synch this device to iTunes and it kept getting stuck on a 30 minute song. I couldn't use my lap top cuz it kept freezing. After trying this ten times, and having to reboot my computer ten times, I decided to restore my iPod again and I realized the culprit or my problems: a continuous 30 minute track. So I unchecked the culprit song (despite the fact that this song synch fine before), which caused the synch to continue on the next synch.Now, after synching a few songs, I spent the time to select all the aritsts I want on the iPod and it's stuck at Step 6.It shouldn't take me three days to synch music. I never had this many problems with my iPod Video. Why suddenly are the iPod Touches so unreliable? When did Apple quality fall several notches? And why is all of their software buggy? Even iTunes misbehaves when I'm listening to music and decide to check out the iTunes store; stopping or continuing music that I'm playing at its own will whenver it chooses. Shouldn't music continue playing even when I'm visiting the iTunes Store?Apple products have become too complicated. All I want is a device that stores my music and the iPod Touch is a failure. All I want are features that work seamlessly together. iTunes Match, iTunes, and the hardware on my iPod are all buggy. Things have become too complicated. This isn't what I signed up for.
5	1349395200	I love my new iPod.  I had an ancient one that finally gave up the ghost.  I use my iPod mostly for audiobooks but with all the improvements over my old iPod, I am sure I will start using many of the apps.  It is light, thin and easy to use, as are all Apple products.  I like it!
5	1349395200	Bought this for my 12 yo son.  We are not an Apple family, however they make great products.  The grapghics for his gaming is great.  A free app was loaded to allow the iPod Touch to act as a prepaid cell phone in Hot Spots and also has a Free Test App as well.  Cheaper than a iPhone at this point.  Thumbs up at this point.
1	1349395200	I would like to be able to contact someone about his. I have used this ipod ery little. It seems to have a clitch or something wrong with it. It closes the application I am in at random times and seems to go into a sleep mode inwhich everything is frozen. I can't shut it off or change the screen from the little gray apple icon . It stays like this for hours until it gets very hot then shuts off because the battery runs out. I got it delivered Sept 6th and have used it very little. I don't think this is normal. Wish someone could help.D
5	1349308800	Great working condition love it! Looked brand new and definitely met my expectations and trust me I'm a real picky person lol
4	1349222400	i have never used any apple products or smart phones of any kind.  but i absolutely love this little machine.  some things you need to know before buying though are:1. battery life is most definitely not 40 hours.  just doing stuff on it without being connected and i barely get an hour or two.  on the flip side it juices up quickly though so for me it isnt a big deal.2. definitely get a 32 or higher gig if you want to do anything at all on it.  i was told an 8gb was all i would need but i ended up getting a 64gb(which is a bit much) and i am glad i did.  like other reviewers have said apps take up a bunch of space.3. i dont know the research but some people have told me that downloaded songs/pirated etc... take up less space than cd's do.  if not i have about 1950 songs on it right now from cd's and i am already at almost 15gigs of space.  so buyer beware on that.
5	1349136000	Daughter very pleased and loves the features.  It did have a couple minor scratches on it, but it was functional for sure.  Wish it would have came with the manual though.
2	1349136000	it didn't have a charger it was scratch up it had a cover to hid the scratches i  had  never seen something this scratch up nor be sent without a charger please take notice.
5	1349049600	This is probably the best purchase I have personally made in a very long time. It has thousands of apps that are free that you can get in the app store, and, with internet connection, you can text and call people for free with some apps. I don't even need my phone anymore. This device has saved me more money than it costs, and is a blast to play with on long flights or just to kill time. It manages my calendar, sets reminders, and even takes pictures that I can send to my friends and family. This is an excellent purchase and should be highly recommended over android, (I had an android for a while, and it was great, but is just a piece of crap compared to this thing). I wish I could give it more stars. Just Freaking Awesome.
5	1349049600	I played with my iPod, literally, all day long. My mom was thinking about it, and decided to put some limits on it. "No iPod until you homework is done," she'd say. Then during the summer, "No iPod until your jobs are done."This particular iPod has two cameras, weather and stocks apps, internet [Safari], iTunes, app store, and wi-fi compatability all built-in. Some of its features include iOS 6.0, onscreen keyboard [when needed], blutooth, and a built-in microphone and speaker. I really like Messages. It is a way to communicate with other devices. Just like texting. My favorite part is how thin it is. My iPod 1st generation was as thick as an iPhone, so everyone thought is was an iPhone. I even bought an iPhone case for it. My iPod fit perfectly in it.If you want more space, consider a larger amount of gigabyte.This product is perfect for average teens, and for people who don't want to spend any money on their phone bills. Consider text now [free app] and text free [free app].I would recommend this product to anyone who likes to surf the web, play games, call people [consider apps above], and text [consider apps above]. Somebody who has a Kindle Fire, would love the portable iPod. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who despises the 21st century, or doesn't like having anything in their pocket except pocket change. If you like playing games on a PC, only on a PC, this product isn't for you.
5	1349049600	It's all I ever needed. Arrived on time, made me smile when it came.  My daughter set it up.  I was able to use it right away after charging.
5	1348876800	Was everything my daughter wanted/expected. Plus it arrived 2days earlier than expected even using the free shipping! We are very satisfied customers! Slightly less expensive than the in store selection.
5	1348876800	omg i didnt login my account almost year now i logged in it show to give review i will say this ipod its wonderful and i got it with new packaged and i am using it without any problem
5	1348876800	Sound quality out of the built in speakers is amazing and the iPod holds a good charge so I give it a 5/5 if I ever need another one I know who to come see
5	1348876800	i was completely surprised at the different functions possible with this item.  It was delivered as promised and i have experienced zero problems with it.  It was a very good buy.
5	1348704000	Upon first examination, the 4th instalment of Apple's iPod touch is quite the site. The retina display shows extremely vivid color content on the screen. But what is even more impressive is the overall weight of it. It comes in at a whopping 3.56 grams. The 3.5 inch display makes it an attractive option for movies/TV shows. Staying true to its origin, the iPod touch still plays music and with millions of downloadable content on iTunes, makes it a must have. I am currently writing this review while listening to the Kanye West station on the Pandora app, one of millions of apps available in the App Store. Additional features like the famous earbuds and charging chord allow you to experience the most advanced piece of technology to date quicker than you can imagine!
4	1348704000	I had my Ipod touch 4th generation for 2 years now. The battery life is still good and I am quite pleased about the battery life. The only thing that I persuade you to do is not to buy this now if you want an Ipod. I would wait for the 5th generation Ipod touch. I got an email from apple saying "introducing the new lighter and thinner Ipods that are faster than ever!" The new Ipod touch is supposed to have a 4inch retina display, with Siri, 1080p video recording front and back, and more colors than ever to choose from! So in the outcome spending the extra money to buy the new Ipod is well worth it! So if you still want this one and I didn't change your mind about waiting and getting the new Ipod then go ahead and get it... But i highly suggest you to get the new Ipod and you will be much happier!
5	1348617600	Wonderful---Of course-- Bought it from Apple  Find it appalling that you tell me just how much to write---VERY CONTROLLING!!!!  You may not control my review!!!
5	1348617600	This is the best product I have ever purchased! I would recommend this to everyone.  It is with me from morning until night. You have everything you want, radio, facebook, games, camera, videos, everything. If you are looking for the perfect gift for someone look no further.
5	1348617600	It's great, fast, and an easy way to browse the internet and stay in contact with friends and family. Very fast and 8GB is quite enough memory! Definitely recommend it!
5	1348617600	HelloItem arrived soon! I think iPod touch is Apple`s a great product! It`s not overpriced and etc..Item arrived soon! I think iPod touch is Apple`s a great product! It`s not overpriced and etc..Item arrived soon! I think iPod touch is Apple`s a great product! It`s not overpriced and etc..
3	1348531200	Well I was super excited to receive it and put all my music and videos and apps on it. It was in great condition. I was extremely disappointed that there were only 6.4 GB TOTAL on the touch that was supposed to be 8 GB6.4 what the heck is that? I mean, I was expecting it I fall short a little because I remember when I bought my 8 GB nano, it fell short at about 7.4 GBBut THIS. That's almost two gigs short! Such bs I was very angry.You get what you pay for I suppose.
4	1348444800	I am an Android supporter and I have never owned iAnything.  I feel its overpriced and not worth the actual cost.  You pay for the brand and the hype.  However its what my daughter wanted for her birthday.  So I got it.  She likes it and is happy with it.  Of course she didn't pay for it, but it works well and she is happy with it.  4 stars. lose one star for iPrice.
5	1348444800	Great product. It was shipped really fast and arrived quickly. It works perfect and I can only recommend it. Superltive.
4	1348444800	The iPod itself is great.  I love the product, the options are great, and the capabilities are limitless.  If you are going to buy an iPod though, definitely go for at least the 16GB or even the 32.  I maxed this one out the first day, mainly with songs.  To install apps, I had to delete songs.  I decided to return it and get a larger format.  That would be my recommendation!
5	1348358400	shipped fast was cheap as described the ipod came with extras not even mentioned so i am very pleased thats all
4	1348358400	I think I like it...this is a new type of product so I've found the learning curve to be a little steep.  It would have made it easier if Apple had inserted a small 'how to start' page for those users coming from a PC (not Apple/MAC) environment.
5	1348358400	I have had this i pod for about 5 months and its perfect! I have had no problems with it !
3	1348358400	Trying to save money, and thinking I wouldn't need to store that much music anyway, we bought 8G for myself (husband has 32).Apps take up a ridiculous amount of storage. Ones you don't think will (solitaire- what?) and pictures/video take up more storage than you'll think too.Updates take a ridiculous amount of storage.I am a fan of the operating system- its familiar, user friendly, etc. but I cannot recommend the 8G version at all.Also- you'd think apple could've figured out a Better camera- the iPhone camera is much better. This one is good only if you are outside. Otherwise it's super grainy. And you can't save pics to desktop. Annnoying.Ive had this for over a year now though, and other than crappy storage & stupid updates, te product is holding up well. Very durable. I did buy from amazon- used prime shipping so recieved it quickly and in good packaging.
5	1348358400	Outstanding product ... I love being able to do FaceTime with my granddaughter. Also enjoy being able to access email and the Web whenever possible.
5	1348185600	Producto de muy buena calidad y atencion de parte del proveedor muy especial. Totalmente satisfecho con el servicio que me prestaron, volveria a negociar con ellos
4	1348185600	I have been a fan of the classic iPod for a really long time and as soon as the iPod touch came out I wanted it, but of course the issue of money came up. I really love the fact you can do a lot of things on the iPod touch that you can do with most phones- play games, download useful apps, take pictures and/or video as well as having music and having an app that let's you call or text someone's phone. Although the product itself may look promising, I'm pretty disappointed with the battery life. If apple is going to add all these new features, they need to make the battery life withstand these high power sucking apps. Slimmer and sleeker is modern, everyone loves having something slim enough to fit into their pocket, however I disagree. I wouldn't mind if it was bigger, because that would mean the processor would also be bigger and that would allow more time on Skype. The reason I believe most apps like Skype suck is because the iPod's processor cannot handle the large capacity of video and sound. Likewise, I really love playing apps but since I had about 7 games it was really slowing my iPod down to the point it froze.. It was kind of a let down. All in all, there are obvious pros and cons to buying this product, I find it useful when I can use Starbucks wifi in case I forgot my cell phone at home to contact a family member or just listening o music. The new iOS is pretty neat, but I didn't notice any chances besides the skin and some bugs that need to be fixed. I hope this review helps someone. :)
5	1348185600	I love it!  It is meeting all of my needs.  Battery could last a little longer but its been working ok.
5	1348099200	Received ipod and we are extremely happy with the product. Hopefully my Grandson likes it as much as we do. Thanks
5	1348099200	wonderful!!!! does everything I need it to, fast and apps are good. downloads are fast, music is great. will by another one when the next grandchild needs one.
4	1347840000	Purhcaed this for someone else. They seem to like it so far. Handy, works great with the 8GB which seems to be enough. I will keep an eye on it to see how it preforms over the next few months.
5	1347840000	Item shipped promptly and arrived as advertised.I use my iPod 4th gen white mostly for email, web browsing, youtube videos, phone over wifi network, texting, facetime, iMessage, and gaming.I got my first desktop personal computer in 1989, and now I fit a computer in my pocket with the iPod.I was disappointed that in 2011, Apple didn't upgrade the iPod.In 2012, Apple just announced the iPod 5th gen, and it blows this one away.But the iPod 4th gen delivers as advertised; was great from 2010 to 2012, now it's ok and still usable if you can get it for a cheap price.
4	1347840000	This is a very fun product with thousands of apps and games. But that is not it; you can listen to music, video chat with friends and family, take videos and pictures, check your email, check the time, go on youtube, log onto facebook, write reminders, and much, much more. I would recommend this product to a friend.
5	1347753600	This is a very good device. The retina display is fantastic and i have no complaints. I like that it is not very heavy and is very thin.
4	1347753600	I purchased the White 8GB iPod Touch from an Apple-Certified store.  As many other reviewers were pleased, so was I. The pictures and video were crystal clear in 1080p resolution. My only gripes were the small keypad (there may be an app for that), and that 8GB simply wasn't enough room for my apps and music.  I ended up selling it because I wanted to buy a smartphone. Although I would recommend a smartphone instead of the Touch, you cannot go wrong with it if you want an mp3 player/casual gaming system.
4	1347753600	The Ipod Touch 8g from Apple is a very unique and dependable mp3 player. Before I purchased my Ipod Touch I was debating whether or not to get the 32g instead of the 8g. However I'm glad I chose the 8g, since the memory space is more than enough for me. There are plenty of apps that you can download to keep you occupied when you are bored. There seems to be an app for just about anything you can think of. The touch screen and the way apple set everything up makes the process of going through and looking through your music more enjoyable and easy to access. The sound quality's good and the music on it can be played pretty loud. I love my Ipod and I highly recommend this mp3 player to anyone who enjoys listening to music.Almost everybody has an Ipod; it seems to be a very popular mp3 player. You can do pretty much anything you want on an Ipod, like check the weather, browse the Internet, check your bank account, and find directions to a store. Its slim design makes it very easy to carry around and hold. It's battery life last a couple hours and charges pretty quickly. I don't have many negative comments to say about it besides the fact that the back gets scratched really easily. Although that can be fixed with a cover, which can come in many different colors and designs. Not only can you store music in the Ipod, but you can also store videos, and photos. They've made ipod's compatible with a lot of different things as well like, stereos, computers, speakers, and alarm clocks. Personally I have an IHome, where I connect my Ipod to charge and play my music. I love my Ipod, and play songs all day on my IHome. The itunes store makes it easier to buy music than actually going to the store and buying it. It seems like Ipod's are getting rid of CD's since it is more common to buy music on your ipod than going to the store and buying a CD. If you consider yourself a music-enthusiast, I believe the best mp3 player you can get is an Ipod Touch.In conclusion, if you want to buy an mp3 player, an Ipod Touch would be my best suggestion. You can't go wrong with it; it is much more than just an mp3 player, the things you can do with an Ipod are limitless. Ipod's are also very portable and have extremely good graphics. You can also play music without the headphones if you ever want to play a song out loud. Ipod Touch's are the latest in mp3 technology. If you are looking for an mp3 player and want something that is more than just an mp3 player, an Ipod Touch might be what you are looking for. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an mp3 player you can do more than just listen to music on.
2	1347667200	Purchased this item for a birthday present for my husband.asy process, prompt delivery. Chose it because said had capability for 2000 songs. At first was only able to put 275, called apple , worked through it but still only able to download 1200 songs. Very frustrating.The next size up is out of my price range.
3	1347580800	I feel like it's 1997 all over again with the VGA quality pictures of the camera aboard this generation of Ipods. Other than that I have no complaints about the excellent display, graphics, ease-of-use, and reliability.
2	1347580800	We bought two of these iPod touches and the home button just stopped working on one of them after about 6 months.  We returned it for repair and they sent it back saying that there was water damage so they couldn't do anything to help us.  This unit has never gotten wet so we're not happy with the product at all.
5	1347494400	I just LOVE MY IPOD TOUCH!!!! It came the same day after my last lecture final. I bought it as a reward for passing all of my classes for the summer semester. The wait was worth it and all my hard work paid off. I bought it when it was cheaper and I just love it!!!
5	1347408000	the only way to stay in touch with the younger generation is to copy them.  this iPod has everything you need when away from home
5	1347408000	Excelent product, always with the apple garanty, my son is using every day, and he is very happy and waitting for buy another apple product
5	1347321600	I bought Ipod Touch for my husbands birthday and he loves it.He uses it to run with and uses in his car everyday. Ipod touch is a great investment. I recommend buying the 16 or 32gb and spending the extra money.8gb fills up faster than you think.
4	1347321600	The  iPod touch 4, fourth generation, can come in varying sizes of memory (GB, Gigabytes) and is a great device to listen to music, browsing the internet, using applications, which is software that helps users perform specific tasks, and a multitude of other things. Although there are other devises that can accomplish the same things. The iPod is a great mesh of well-made hardware and software that can do what it would normally take one or more devises to do the same things. The question about iPods isn't if they're great, because it is a wonderfully devise like many others, but is it really worth all the attention?It's almost like having a smart phone, minus cell service, a very nice mp3 player, and a basic computer in your pocket. Like smart phones and computers, it can browse the internet. Only down fall to this is that it has to have Wi-Fi internet access, unlike computers that can use a cable or Wi-Fi, or smart phones that use cell tower in the vicinity plus Wi-Fi like the iPod. The iPod is very similar to smart phones in many ways, other than how they access the internet.Most people have noticed that a smart phone's battery does not last very long. The life of the battery is further shortened once the Internet starts being used. The advantage with the iPod is that its battery life is very extensive. If used non-stop, the battery on an iPod can last from eight to twelve hours way beyond the capacity of most smart phone. This, coupled with a sleek design and topped with a smooth, synchronized touch screen makes the iPod favorable when compared with smart phones. In fact, some smart phones today are being built with a design very similar to the iPod functionally. HTC, however, can never duplicate the results from the first four generations of the iPod.If you like to listen to music all day and need something that you can literally take anywhere, an iPod is a must. Most iPods built today have the capacity to store about 2,000 songs that you can listen to for about 40 hours. It uses Apple's iTunes; a program where you can purchase downloads, to upload music and photos. The average mp3 player can store as many songs, but most do not. They also don't have the ability to accessing applications and download directly, which limits you to only listen to music. The iPod was built largely to be able to multitask; it is one of its well-known qualities. With the iPod, not only are you able to enjoy listening to music, but you are also able to access the Internet, and much much more.So is the iPod a luxury item? For most it will be, but it can also be viewed as a necessity for others. It's a wonderful devise, which can outlast most smart phones and since it has many abilities like smart phones it can be used in place. I highly recommend it to anyone without a smart phone, and if you like to listen to music while on the move and want to keep your smart phone from being used, I highly recommend it. It is a sleek, efficient device that can do the all the basic and simple tasks you would like.
4	1347321600	One in a MillionThe iPod 4th generation is one in a million. There are several reasons to why this iPod is worth having. The 4th generation iPod touch has many of the new features that introduces the iPhone 4, the new touch invites comparison with the iPhone. In some ways the iPhone is better than the iPod touch, but that's because it's a phone and phones are always better then another device. Phones are always made to be better than any other product on the market, especially when it comes to apple products. Between the storage, internet, size, and devices itself, I would say this is a well produced product from the apple corporation.This iPod is a phone without the phone part to it and I say that this iPod was honestly the best investment that I have, because it's a separate device that holds all my music. My phone is for my personal information but it's also my life, but then again my iPod is my world. I know that most people already think that I'm crazy just for saying that two devices is better, but in all reality what will happen when you run out of room in your phone and you know it's the music taking up all the space? It's just better to have the two devices so you wouldn't have to worry about it. Yeah the fact that you have to carry two things around can be a pain. I find it alright I mean it's not the greatest thing , but to me it's worth doing I know I won't lose my phone or iPod. I'm just the girl who always has those two things on me.I love the fact that with this generation of iPods that you can check your email and have internet access on it. I personally have voxer and instagram on my iPod because my phone isn't as smart as most phones out these days. The fact that I can walk to class and listen to my music, just rocking out and then being able to checking my email and also play games, it's just a great combination to me. Having all these apps on my iPod is better than being on my phone, just because the fact that my phone isn't like most phones. Yeah my phone may be a smart phone, but it's a stupid one at best, and that's where my iPod comes in handy. This iPod is also smaller than the previous iPods, so it fits into a pocket just right and you can barely notice when it's there.  I personally love the fact that I can put my iPod anywhere and not being able to also lose my iPod, but I always know where I end up putting it with how small and thin it is. This iPod touch is by far the best iPod that I've had in a long time, and tend to keep this iPod for a long time.Most people with their reviews say that they hate this iPod that it's the worst thing that they can have. That it can be a very fragile product to have, but they say that, because they don't take care of their iPod. Most people think that they can just drop it or throw it however they please to test how fragile it can be. No wonder why it breaks so easy with them, but then some people can take care of their things and that one drop can just crack your screen and it sucks. You can always purchase a warranty for your iPod, so when you crack the screen or just happen to drop it into water or something out of the ordinary you can always get it fixed. The iPod touch 4th generation is better not only because of the internet access, but from the size and also the storage I have on it. It's one and a million and I don't know what I would do if I didn't have this iPod with me at all times.
4	1347321600	This came quick and is only scratched on the back of the unit. I am putting a case on it since it's for my 9yrs old son so no worries. Two words great stuff!!
5	1347321600	We have had many Ipods, this is a replacement for one that was lost. It is a smaller GB size so takes some getting used to but has been great. Arrived quickly in perfect packaging.
5	1347235200	excellent product excellent, very good ipod I love and attention was immediate, as received in good condition 100% recommended you purchase another opportunity lo maximo ufff
5	1347235200	Apple iPod touch 8GB White (4th Generation) NEWEST MODELTo be very honest what I really want is an iPad Tablet which I do not think I will every be able to afford.I already have a iphone4 and I am getting an iMac PC from my school department where I worked for 20 Years.  It is going to be totally loaded, wireless, the largest screen that they make all for $500.  I would love to stay with Apple seeing that everything I will have will be Apple.I have no problems with an iPod.  I just do not have a need for it.Thank you.Judith A. Fleming
5	1347235200	We think the Itouch 4 rocks!!!!! We are always on it. We love to FaceTime each other from our rooms and play games with and on it. Everything is amazing! Everything works like magic and it is the best present any of us has gotten. Thank you Mommy for buying us this!!!!
1	1347148800	We have had this item for less than 3 weeks and now the screen won't work!!!!!!!!!!!! How do we return this and get it replaced?
3	1347062400	Love the product but it was delivered with a scratch on the back. It was a gift do that was disappointing
5	1347062400	Very glad we got this. My boyfriend's little girl absolutely loves it! She has been playing with is and listening to music, etc ever since the moment she got it! Great value!:)
5	1346976000	Purchased an iPod touch from a discounted private dealer.  As such a little worried about the quality, whether or not it would show up 'like new.'  Very pleased with the product received, behaves to Apple factory standards.
5	1346976000	Awesome deal and good packaging just awesome so I think who ever wants one should get it and amozon gives good deals
5	1346976000	Love this product can contain so much information.  Portable to use everywhere.  Can be connected to car speakers and portable speakers. Sorry it took me so long to purchase.
4	1346889600	I realley like my new I Pod Touch there are plenty of free apps to make it enjoyable, plus it holds my favorite tunes its a great piece of tech.
4	1346889600	I just got this today. Actually I'm typing this on my iPod. Anyways I love this product and highly reccomend it. It is LITERALLY an iPhone without the phone. So thin and sleek too! one thing I did not realize about this is that the back is a silvery metal color. Not white. And if you use the iPod a lot it heats up and the silvery metal is hard to hold in your sweaty hands. Also it attracts a lot of fingerprints. My case hasn't shipped yet, but once I get it this shouldn't be a problem. Other than that, all I can say is that iPod touch is perfect. Get it. Right now.
5	1346889600	Ipod touch is a great way for my daughter to have music and game apps at her finger tips. We don't have wifi, but once she got what we wanted downloaded by going to a wifi place, she had everything she wanted in her Ipod to use when she is at home. Never ending free apps, a little confusing to do the setup, with the passwords and all, but once it's up and running, it was a great find!!
5	1346889600	TEAM looks excellent, and well defined USING THE SAME PLEASE INFORM ME IF YOU CAN COME UNLOCKED FOR USE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
4	1346889600	I was happy for the fast shipping and it came in good (new) condition just as promised! However, the battery charging was only good for the first 3 days i got it. After i plugged it in to charged, it takes 5 minutes to start up. This is not normal, it also looses its battery power very quickly, and i turn it off while im not using it. I would give it 5 stars, but i am a little bit disappointed that the power is running out fast already and that it takes a while to start up for it to charge. I know ipods are eventually supposed to do this as time goes by, but this ipod touch started doing this right away.
5	1346889600	One of the best multimedia players out there. A very fun experience for me.Pros:-Very light, slim design.-Apple Store, which means access to dozen of apps, Youtube, Safari (internet browser), Netflix, Dropbox, etc. (Can be jailbroken at your own risk.)-Very touch sensitive.-Good audio quality and easy navigation when it comes to listening to music.-Doesn't have retina display but the picture quality seems crispy clear.-Voice control. Although not always accurate I'd consider it a pro. Hold the home button and you can tell it to play an album, or the next song, etc.-1 year warranty.-Speaker and microphone. Make voice recordings. The speaker on the bottom definitely isn't the best, in a quiet setting you can hear it pretty good.-If you were to accidentally unplug your earphones, it stops playing music.Cons:-Due to it's slim design, it is very fragile. Just dropping it once may break it. I'd recommend buying a case. If mines didn't have one, well, it would've been broken months ago.-(Personal problem) Don't like the clicky home or lock buttons. I abused my home button, (pressing it too hard) it finally got stuck exactly over a year.My niece's iPhone home and lock buttons got stuck as well ;P.-0.7 MP camera. Definitely doesn't take the best quality pictures or record the best videos but then again, it is primarily an MP3 player.-(Another personal problem) If you love apps, music, and movies. DO NOT GET THE 8GB. First time getting a device like this and I thought 8GB would be enough, well it's not.It only actually has around 7GB's when you get it. Taking pictures and videos, uploading music, downloading apps, well 7GBs isn't even close to enough.-(My last personal problem) iTunes. Even though you simply drag audio files (accepts most audio formats) to your iTunes library then sync, well I'm not the biggest fan of it.YOU NEED iTUNES. You don't have it well too bad, you can't upload squat. Even though with the small capacity, I'd love to upload videos. But you have to convert them which can be a pain soI never uploaded a video from my PC to my iPod. (PRO: You can buy music such as songs, albums, and even videos from the iTunes store though.)Overall: A great device I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed with unless you receive a defective one. Longevity will last without negligence or abuse (like me, but it still works ;)It closely resembles an iPhone in many ways except this iPod uses Wi-Fi. You can make calls and texts with apps, calls aren't always the best with Wi-fi, but like I said earlier, it is an MP3 player. Personally I'd recommend this for anyone who wants a good, well built MP3 player. And as you may have noted, most of the cons were just personal problems of mine anyways. 5/5!!
4	1346803200	best device ever! get a case first though. i got this for my birthday and dropped it and it cracked. so i got a replacement one for $100. so i suggest getting the otterbox
5	1346803200	WORTH THE HYPE! It is so much fun and has many free apps! It is one of the best Apple products out there and for the price right now, it is really good.
3	1346457600	Good afternoon,I write because I want to tell you what happened to me, made &#8203;&#8203;a few days ago to buy Apple iPod touch 8 GB Generation 4 (White), but I inadvertently wrote a wrong shipping address, luckily I was able to communicate with the USPS and went to pick up my packages personally on 08/24/2012 at USPS headquarters in the city of Chicago. However, my package was open and empty. My item was stolen. The person who handed me the package USPS told me that was not responsible for that loss, and I feel cheated understand or even know how to make a claim on Amazon for this cause, I would like someone to help me because I can not waste my money one failure of the courier company used AMAZON providers.Thanks for listening.Maylen Polanco.
5	1346284800	One of the best gifts I have ever received.  I am never without it.  I love the fact that I can obtained all of the music of my generation (the 60's).
5	1346284800	Just got my new Ipod Touch and I love it !. Cant wait to get sum apps and get the rest of my music on here. Ordered it monday night and got it wedsnday ... awsome service amazon :D
5	1346112000	I bought this Ipod and I do not regret it! I use it all the time to play music, apps, check email, face time and whatnot. I totally recomend this object! :^)
2	1346025600	The iPod showed up with a slight crack in the screen. My son wanted it sooo bad, he was willing to accept it with the crack and didn't tell me about it. Since then, he dropped it and made the crack worse. What is my recourse. I didn't see an option for insurance when I purchased it. Amazon resolved the situation imediately and without a hitch. Great to do business with you.Sincerely,Joel D. Lamp
3	1345939200	First purchase of Ipod touch, I have classic Ipod and still is great. Ipod touch, first I noticed easy to get going, but would like the itunes software on the ipod so I wouldn't have to download it. Lets say, please wait while download takes about 30 minutes. Time to twiddle my thumbs. Okay Second, How much thinner can you make these things, I mean I feel like I will break this paper thin electronic device. Third, 8GB for `$200, a big price gouge for a small piece of space, especially when coming from an 80gb classic with more space, almost all my library fits.Fourth, Instructions....... ummm really, a folded piece of paper that I can barely read. I have glasses, but need a magnifine glass to read it.Added improvement with the built in speakers if you don't want to use head phones.Wifi, love it.can't figure out how to sync stuff from Ipod to Library on computer, since using the wifi app store or what ever its called.Ok Product, too much hype, but cool.Will use it loads, just not one to be the first for the next model when it comes out. Need more memory for the money.Thanks for reading my complaints, hope it helps.
5	1345939200	How - and I do mean HOW - did I get along without this little item, before?Photos, Facebook, contacts, email, twitter just keeping the business going while on the road - it's priceless.Of course, you have to find wifi, but most places we go to do business have wifi someplace, and it hooks up easily.The photo capability is good enough for blogging and marketing, so your customers won't think the Aliens came and got you. Easy, fun, simple.And a great Amazon price.(No, we can't download our full contacts list as we can with the IPod, but think of it this way:  A MacBook is a Thoroughbred. An IPad is a nice mule.  the IPod is a cute little donkey that gets you there, well enough).Good enough, right enough.
5	1345680000	I'm really enjoying my iPod touch! I love that i can add apps take pics face time it's in really good shape really got my moneys worth new heads sets and usb came with it
2	1345680000	i have an ipod 1 and 4 gen...wanted jump to a new level with a touch and got the 32gb touch 4geni have to say that the quality of the product is very goodthe problem is with the performance of the sound...is very bad quality for an ipodis like an AM radio with static, no way to fix it with EQ...i think they forgot that an ipod is for music, is the reason for an ipodthe apps and other functions are a plus that i thanks, but not the reason to buy an ipodif i need apps and "pluses" i buy an iphone or ipad, not an ipodabout the amazon service, they are the best....In all waysi recomend you think about it, and if you want hear your music with a better qualityget an ipod classic the price is almost the same, and you get much more Gb for your moneyand over all, better much better performance for music
5	1345680000	I was not a big fan of portable music due to the bulky construction of the players. I took the chance of purchasing the Apple iPod touch and I've been pleased ever since. It's light weight and easy to carry inside a pocket or pouch accessories. I put it to use in downloading ebooks for Western Lit. course in college so I can listen to stories for writing assignments while at work. It became a fantastic tool for college.
5	1345680000	This ipod is an excellent devise.  I bought it for my children and they loved it.  My wife even loved it more than the kids. The kids use it  to access their own cartoon shows on the Internet.  They watch more video than listening to the music.  The sound and picture image are excellent.
5	1345680000	The product was what was ordered and arrived on time.  This Ipod is truly amazing on what it can do.  It was a gift and the recipient is still learning about all of its features.
5	1345593600	This is my new favourite gadget. Such an amazing upgrade to my second generation nano! lolVery responsive touch screen, easy to set up for e-mail and communication apps (eg, Skype, Viber, MagicJack) as well as fun stuff like Instagram or Kindle software.Great sound quality, even though the ipod earbuds aren't the best sounding out there. And nice to use the speakers too, rather than only the earbuds.Fun, fun, fun.
5	1345593600	i really want this item . I just recently lost my my iphone that i used a ipod touch so know i am looking for a new one but my mom won't let me get. for all of you that have on you are so lucky i wish i could be in your shoes right now.
1	1345507200	If you take this thing with you for a walk or commute to listen to music you will skip songs everytime your hand/finger touches the screen while in your pocket. when the lock screen comes on you need to unlock it to pause the song or rewind it, the reason this exists is even beyond me as if you enable calling/messaging on this piece of garbage with a cell plan you have an iphone and if you quadrouple it's size you have an Ipad...yet sheep buy all three, Steve Jobs truly is a little Bo Peep. Itunes sucks and is getting slower with each update (every week) with the amount of bloatware Apple keeps packing into it. The touch is way to delicate, if you drop this (which you will at some point) there is an 80% chance you will brick it or break the screen which costs almost as much as this ripoff device to get repaired, again why does this exist!??!!  We need some good quality durable MP3 players, not smaller and larger Iphones that do nothing that any other Iphone/PAD/POD/NANO can do they all have the same functionality and owning anymore than one of these devices is a waste even more so than the initial Apple purchase as they are all the same closed, useless device.  Look around there are far better, durable, more reliable players out here for better price.  Sandisk, Sony, Samsung, Cowon all have better players that don't require Itunes bloatware, you just drag and drop what you want and the non-I players have expanion slots for additional memory.  The Ipod classic is an exception to the above as it used to be well made, design gets cheaper every generation and was durable as hell as long as it's not left in the cold, heat, or touched by water, but again it's plagued with freeze up's and Itunes iron chain.  With the touch and Iphone I had the same issues as they are the same exact device, if you get a raindrop or anything around the ear phone jack it locks itself into "headphone mode" and you cannot hear any sound, music, games or anything.  Resetting the iphone/Ipod does nothing to fix this problem, Apple store "guru's" are retards that follow a check sheet any lay person could to fix something simple, to say the least nothing worked.  I fixed the probem myself by plugging in and unplugging the earphones like 200 times until it came out of "headphone" mode.  So if you listen to music on this device in a clean, padded room with pillows on the floor you will be ok, otherwise pick a better more durable player that isn't iron chained to itunes for everything.
5	1345507200	I dont like iTunes, but that is something you have to expect with when you want APPLE. Anyway its great!!!
5	1345161600	It"s wonderful product but I still don"t know how to downloads music.I need ask some guy.Do you when we can buy the iPhone 5 in this summer?
5	1345161600	I bought this for my Granddaughter, and she loves it.  I was happy with the price, and the shipping time.  This is the 2nd ipod touch, that I purchased from Amazon and have been more than happy with both purchases.
5	1345161600	I've been using a Palm Pilot for many years and decided that it was time to upgrade to an iTouch.  I'm glad that I did.  The iTouch comes with the ability to make lists, which I use for shopping and other things.  The free apps that are available are helpful and entertaining.  I highly recommend the iTouch.  Amazon had the best price.  I like shopping at Amazon because I can see a multitude of products and info about each which helps me to make a decision about what to buy and then the prices are good.
5	1345075200	this a great item my grandaughter loves it . Keeps her busy and she love to download all the music that she can .
5	1344816000	this is my third itouch...broke screen in the first one and apple replaced....lost the 2nd one fell out of my swea have to pay tshirt pocket and got this one really fast thru amazon...now I installed the lost ipad ap and can now track it thru my ipad...Plus did not tax compared to ebay
2	1344816000	This iPod it s amazing. I love it. But I received it many days after delivery date estimated. I was so disappointed cause I should travel. I found it when I was back home 4 months later. Come on guys, you can do better
1	1344729600	When I purchased this unit it was supposed to contain ear buds and a USB cable. Even though they were both listed on the packing list they were not sent. When I contacted the company about this they apologized and promised these items would be sent immediatly.They were never sent!  Even though the unit work and was in good condition, my 11 year old son,who saved his money to purchase this item,felt very ripped off. Very disappointed.......twice.
5	1344643200	I bought this for my son. Now he never goes anywhere without it! Win/win. He's happy/I'm a hero! LOL. Such a versatile item.
4	1344556800	It is what you expect with an iPod.  It is pretty much an iPhone without the "phone" although you can always get an app for that.  I find that I have plenty of memory for apps and music, despite it being only an 8gb.My only issue would be that it doesn't play flash videos, but that is just the way Apple is and it's going to be like that, likely forever. *lol*  Anyhow, I am pleased with this purchase and I use it daily.  I never thought I would, but I do and the wi-fi is very convenient.Great as alternative phone too.... =)
5	1344470400	When my son indicated he wanted and iPod touch, I was less than thrilled. He is still sp young to want such a gadget. As an IT professional and overall Apple nut, I knew it was an investment. He has been unbelievably happy and so have I. He uses it for game apps and Facebook (another conversation altogether!) but Words with Friends has helped to improve his spelling! I can't wait to see how much it has helped when he goes back to school in the fall. He even took some pictures with it on our family reunion that I neglected. Already worth the $$$!
5	1344384000	Love my ipod gen 4 touch!!!! couldn't be happier! I bought one for my grandson also , he will be 13 and I know he will LOVE IT!!
4	1344384000	To start off I am reviewing the Apple iPod Touch 32 GB Model (Black). This device is definitely way better than all of its previous models no doubt about it, but it obviously isn't exactly "perfect". Now, it has lots of (+) about it, but it also has some (-) to it. I will break my review up into sections to avoid reading things that you already know...====Display====The Retina Display on the this iPod is the BEST out of all the other iPod Generations; however, it isn't quite as good as the Retina Display on the iPhone. It has a 960 by 640 Backlit LCD display making it pack an amazing 326 pixels per inch! If you currently own a 3rd Generation iPod touch you will see the difference immediately!  Reading text on the iPod is Really sharp and the graphics on the games for the iPod will shock you. I didn't expect so much from such a small screen.====Voice Control====Now voice control is something that I personally think you are never going to use. It isn't like Dictation on the iPad or like Siri on the iPhone 4S so don't get your hopes up; however, this feature definitely makes your iPod a lot better. Why? You might be asking, because to use voice control the iPod needs a microphone to hear you right ? Get where I'm going with this? The built in microphone allows you to make calls like a phone with some FREE apps that you can download in the App Store! It also allows you to FaceTime with other people that own iDevices.====AirPrint====This is one of the best things on the iPod touch! The ability to print wirelessly to your printer if your printer has air print! You can print out photos to PDF files to your printer straight from your iPod touch! This is something that is a must have considering that the iPod is almost a computer.====iCloud====iCloud is new in ios 5 allowing your iPod to update its self with the "cloud" wirelessly of course! You no longer need to own a computer to own an iPod because of this amazing new feature! It also allows you to store all of your apps, music, and movies in the cloud! With this said, it automatically pushes all of your pictures, apps, etc to all of your other iDevices wirelessly! It also allows you to restore an iPod and get all of your contacts and information automatically if you ever have to restore an iPod.==== The Cameras====This is where the iPod has some negatives to it....Pros:* It at least has a camera now, but what doesn't have a camera now a days? Almost everything has cameras even the simple phones do!* the rear camera is able to shoot HD video in 720P!* Has a front facing camera for Face TimeCons:* Front facing Camera does not support HD video, it does not look really good at all.* Rear Facing camera does not have Flash; therefore, you can't take those night time pictures like other phones can.* Although it can shoot 720P video, video and still shots only look good in places with lots of sun light.====Games + Apps====With Apple's App Store you can download tons of free applications that look really nice on the iPod Retina Display! With most paid apps ranging between $1 to $6 buying games on the iPod touch is a real bargain! There are some really good Games in the app store that normally would cost around $40-$50 for a platform like the PS3 & XBOX, but on the iPod there only about $3 and they look amazing! There are numerous apps that have many functions from listening to music to streaming movies to even getting receipies for cooking! There is something for everyone in the App Store. There are way more applications to choose from on the App Store than on the Google Play Store for Android devices.====Air Play====If you have an Apple TV you can Mirror almost anything from the small screen to the big screen of an HDTV! That's right, you can mirror pictures to YouTube videos to even Netflix on your Tv with air play!====Battery Life====The battery life on the iPod touch is OK. It obviously won't last as much as an iPad, but it does hold a pretty good charge for such a small device. I would say you can get a good 40 hours from Music play back or at least 5 hours of video playback.====Overall====Overall if you are looking for something really similar to an iPhone, but don't want to pay every month I wouldn't  hesitate about getting an iPod Touch! I would NOT exchange this for a Laptop or a computer, but I would definitely upgrade from an iPod touch 3rd Generation to enjoy all the new features.**** Make sure to buy a Screen protector and a Cover for these iPods are very fragile and can break quite easily without proper care!****
2	1344384000	I ordered a reconditioned iPod Touch, 4th Generation for my granddaughter's 13th birthday. They sent the wrong cable...right now it's useless to me.  The cable they sent was for an iPod Classic.  Since her birthday is in two days I ordered the correct cable and I hope it will arrive on time.  It was very disappointing.
4	1344297600	It is an itsy bitsy teeny weeny iPad. So iF u don't loose things in the couch it is great.
2	1344297600	I purchased the product, and from the day that I opened the box, the home key did not work properly. It took/takes several presses to respond. I contacted Apple customer service, and arranged to return the iPod for service. They did not repair it, but returned the same unit, with a number of scratches and marks, and a condescending note telling me nothing was wrong. Terrible service from a company that should actually care about their customers, but clearly does not. With the bad home key, it is near useless.
5	1344211200	Was very surprised with the quality of the iPod.  A wonderful addition for the van when traveling with grand kids.  Nice to have the car charger with it.
2	1344211200	This is the third iPod, and 2nd iPod touch I have owned.  While I generally love the iPod products (I have bought three after all!), because I like their interface and how they work, I have been particularly unhappy with my latest iPod touch.  I bought this 4th generation iPod with the IOS 5 back in October 2011, when it was just released.  The first thing I noticed was that while 8 GB was more than ample on my old (2nd gen) iPod Touch, with the new OS, I am constantly having to worry about what apps, music and podcasts I can and cannot sync, because my 8 GB is always close to full (I used to have like 2.5 GB free without worry, and now I fight to have 0.5 GB free).  I don't know if it is because of the iPod being so close to full, or if it just has these problems, but I also have more issues with nonresponsiveness or sluggishness in opening apps, etc.  In addition, on my old iPod touch the auto-brightness really worked.  I could use one very dim brightness setting, and could see the screen both at night in my dark bedroom,  and also out in the daylight at noon.  On this 4th gen iPod touch I literally have to change the brightness setting twice a day, so I can see it during the day, but not be blinded at night.  And the real kicker (if that wasn't all enough), is that the 4th gen iPod is extremely breakable!!!  I don't know if I was spoiled with the 2nd gen model or what, but apparently the new model simply can't put up with being dropped hardly at all.  I haven't done anything I didn't do to my old iPod, and while I had it 2 years with no major damage (despite being dropped dozens of times), in just 10 months I have completely destoyed the screen and frame on the 4th gen iPod.  Two of the corners are completely shattered, and another is crumpled so that you can see inside the iPod.  On one of the shattered corners a big chunk of glass has broke off.  I have a network of about 5 major cracks through the length of screen.  I guess the amazing part (besides how fragile the darn thing is), is that is still works with the screen in pieces.  When you look at the profile of the iPod touches, in the 2nd Generation, the metal frame went up around the glass.  In the 4th generation the glass lays above the level of the metal frame; I am guessing this is why is is so fragile.  I guess in the future I will know to look out for this.  I haven't ruled out buying another iPod touch (I do like them -[am I crazy?]), but I think I will be a more astute buyer in the future.  I will look at where the glass lays in relation to the frame (and probably get a protective case no matter what).  And this time if my auto-brightness or something doesn't work, I am taking the iPod back right away, and not wait until I have cracked the thing up and probably voided any warranty.
5	1344211200	MY 7 YEAR OLD NEPHEW LOVES THIS, I BOUGHT IT FOR HIS BIRTHDAY, HE FIGURED IT OUT AND LOVES PLAYING THE MUSIC AND GAMES. IT IS AWESOME AND AMAZON IS REALLY THE BEST PLACE TO ORDER ANYTHING FROM, THEY HAVE GUARANTEES AND IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS THEY FIX IT IN ONE EMAIL...I WILL BUY ANOTHER FOR MY NIECE'S BIRTHDAY.
1	1344211200	I am very disappointed with the IPOD touch which i have received. It was used one i guess which has scratches on the back. There was a missing charger with it. :( :( :( :(:( :(:( :(:( :(:( :(:( :(:( :(:( :(:( :(:( :(:( :(:( :(:( :(.It was actually a gift and i was shocked to see the scratches and missing charger in it.
5	1344211200	Ipod for our daughter.  Very good conditions.  Order was processed very quickly. It came with a charger wire too. She loves it!
5	1344124800	It's like having a mini IPad in your hands, even better it's small not heavy at all can take it with you everywhere, you can perform basically any task with it, only let down it doesn't have flash, I guess Apple is making sure we don't watch free movies on certain site but where there's a will there's a way, great product, the perfect gift for anyone!!
1	1344124800	First of all, I am a life-long fan and customer of apple products. Unfortunately, with this product, my opinion has taken a hit. I read all the reviews about the screen which is easily broken and expensive to fix and thought "o.k., but not me." Have you ever in your life dropped your cell phone? Then rest assured you will drop this very thin ipod one day, and regardless of the surface onto which you drop it, or the height from which you drop it, the odds are that the screen WILL break and the ipod will be toast. Like many of the other hundreds of reviews here, mine lasted a mere three months before it met it's end; perhaps I paid $5/each use of the device, which does not make it a very good deal. Evan if it had lasted, I was not pleased with the design (ear phone plug on bottom of unit, so it's always in your hand? Really?!), and other issues well outlined by others. I would strongly recommend against wasting your money on this product, until Apple gets their act together and designs a more durable device.
5	1344124800	Got this for my granddaughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it. She had an old iPod from her brother that basically played tunes and she really wanted an updated version. This does so much more. She loves the camera and texting. She even transferred all her tunes from her old iPod to this new one by herself and she's only 12 years old!!!!With this iPod she doesn't even need a cell phone.  It arrived in excellent packaging thanks to Amazon people. Got the zebra cover from Amazon to go with it.  Both are awesome.
5	1344038400	Great Ipod Touch, its is good for all people those who want to play 3d games and also watch and listen movies and musics. This is the thing that I really wanted. The good thing is the shipping was blazing fast, I loved the way Amazon shipped this product because I was not expecting that fast shipping and it was Free Super Saver Shipping which is the most slowest shipping. But against all odds Amazon made the shipping very fast. It was a pleasure doing business with Amazon
5	1344038400	I got an IPod Touch for Christmas. It has lots of awesome features such as-- cool apps- music- text availability- internet availability- YouTube, weather, newsAnd so many more. Before I wasn't able to text until i got this amazing device. Now, I am very protective! You do sometimes have to update on certain apps. And it sometimes closes out of what your doing but other than that it is so amazing! GO APPLE!
5	1344038400	I am in love with this iPod. The one complaint I have is that my home button needs to be pressed a certain way for it to function properly. This is a minor defect that only applies to mine so don't worry and definitely buy this!! They could charge way more for this and I still would have bought it.
5	1344038400	When I couldn't find a refurbished i-pod touch 8 GB available on the Apple Store site I looked here.  Not only was it cheaper, but it looked just as new as any refurbished item I have bought from Apple directly.
4	1343952000	I was a little surprised when I received my iPod touch today from Amazon. Amazon sent it without an actual iPod box. It came in a plastic case with a piece of paper around it. I almost thought for a minute that I accidentally purchased a refurbished one. Truth be told, the Amazon price was a deal, but I bought mine for a gift and feel a little weird about it not having a box. Important to know if you are purchasing for a gift.**Update: I've contacted Amazon and as usual, they have remedied the situation and apologized for my iPod not being in a box. Box or no box, you cannot be the price they offer on this great product.
4	1343865600	I love my ipod because I get to have my music and the perks of an iphone without actually having an iphone. The only thing I'm struggling with with now is space. I've had this 8gb since July/2011 and one year, 872 songs, 375 photos and 24 apps later, I am officially out of space. If you can manage with the space, then by all means get the 8gb. If not, save a little more and opt for more space with the 32gb or 64 gb.
4	1343865600	Well this is just your usual run-of-the-mill Apple ipod so nothing too great about the 4th gen. The camera is only .7mp so it is really bad looking on a large display and the front camera is only SD quality. If you need an ipod with a great HD display then this is the one fro you.
5	1343865600	I got one for my 2 oldest kids. They LOVE'em... Just like my iPhones minus the calling feature (But I hear there's an app for that).
5	1343779200	We got this ipod touch for our daughter for Christmas.  She enjoys playing on it. We got her a case and she has dropped the iPod many times and it hasn't cracked at all. So the iPod is nice because even if you drop it, it doesn't crack. But, you should have a case on it. It has 2 cameras which is really nice and you can also take pictures of the screen. Thanks Apple!
5	1343779200	Bought this item for my teen daughter, who picked it out herself on-line. She absolutely loves it, looks and opperates like a new one. Will definately by all my apple products from this store in the future. Thank you for a great product.
1	1343779200	I bought a 64GB iPod touch(4th generation). Its connector broke within a year and it fails to charge or connect to a PC. I sent to Apple repair center but they mailed back with the excuse of misuse. I never had an experience of an electronic device that totally broke within a year. It is a shame on Apple. I probably stay away from Apple products.
1	1343779200	ordered for my sons birthday well in advance.  never got it.  ended up buying it in the store spending more money.  wasted time and money.  highly frustrating!
5	1343779200	very good condition, works great, I am very pleased with this, arrived on time, in great condition well packed, worked right out of the box
4	1343606400	I purchased the Ipod Touch for my granddaughter and she just loves it!!! It was in great shape even though it wasn't a new product.
3	1343606400	Personally I think this little 'computer that can' is absolutely great. Tons of memory, obviously, and recording video is really great. The image quality is superb. I recommend this to all. I can see in ten years from now there will be the iPod with 100GB's  (ha ha ha)!
5	1343606400	use this tool with a bird call application to call birds for response on birdwatching trips. Excelent..."Please write at least 20 words describing your experience with this item. Repeated words don't count. "
5	1343520000	Product was in good shape and shipped promptly..I would recommend this vendor to others and will use them with confidence in future.
5	1343520000	bought this ipad for my wife, she aboslutely loves it. it is sturdy and navigation scroll circle is absolutely fantastic. will buy again without thinking twice.
5	1343433600	Great service, and delivery. My son hasn't stop using it. Keeps him entertained and with all the free aps available it has been one of the best investment
4	1343433600	I take my iPod everywhere.  It's easy to download games and it's fun to play, especially when traveling.  Two thumbs up.
5	1343347200	Got this for my step daughters 13th birthday, she hasn't put it down since she got it.  She loves the camera on the front and the back.  Very easy to use and comes with some great apps already installed.
5	1343260800	i love my new ipod.  you can download the pinger app and text and call for free.  it is like having a phone that you do not have to have a servise plan for.  it is just amazing.  the web is really fast too
5	1343260800	I recommend this to anyone who wants an iPhone but not a bill. So far the user experience has been great, and I am extremely happy with this device. I have used it a lot for school, and have had 0 problems whatsoever.
5	1343260800	I am happy with this. I use it only when I travel and it has lasted me a few trips with no failure. Very handy to have when I need the net or one my zillion apps.
5	1343260800	The IPod touch is great. The Ipod Touch 4th generation arrived right on time. I had a question about the product and they responded quickly and the question was resolved.
1	1343174400	I cannot find instructions for this productso Iam unable to use it.  If I click on anythingon the websight for this product I am charged a lot of money and don't find the instructionsI need.Howard Meshewhmeshew4706@insightbb.com
5	1343174400	Thanks for the ipod, it is everything you describe it to be, it works perfectly and there are no scratches on the front only on the back like you describe. I'm happy that its only a few and I hope to do business with you again thanks!
5	1343174400	As always apple has out done themselves. The iPod came super fast and in tact, works perfectly. My girlfriend really loves it, nice anniversary gift for sure.
5	1343174400	I have the iphone 4 and this is identical minus the phone.  Very lightweight and easy to use.  Apple really has great products, I am never disappointed. I bought this for a 9 year old's birthday.  I won't have to share my phone anymore!
5	1343088000	My son wanted an ipod for his 12th birthday really bad.  I was hesitant to order one from the computer because I couldn't see it first.  It was exactly as described and works perfectly.  I have zero complaints about it.  Of course he was waiting by the door everyday to receive it in the mail.  Luckily, it only took a couple of days, even though I just paid for regular shipping.  Very satisfied with this transaction.
2	1343088000	I bought this iPod and it said works 100 pct and warranty so I bought it because just in case I break it, it has a warranty so I can get a new one. However it came and there was something wrong with the home button. I had to send it back right away!
4	1343088000	I bought this over a week ago and it hasen't been shipped yet and it says that it will be here Friday or Thursday or Saturday. I need it for a trip this weekend and it hasen't shipped yet! Yah it will come the end of the week. Daught it
4	1343088000	It's like having a iphone but without ... the phone!You can download all the apps you want: every app works, also the games run very smoothly.I connected it to my car via cable so I can also have all my music in my stereo, that is great.If you already have a phone, and you don't want to spend lot of money for an iphone, I'm sure that the ipod is the right choice for you!
5	1343001600	This is an amazing device. My daughter bought it with her own money when it was at it's highest price. :( But she LOVES it. loves it to much sometimes because she and her friends are constantly on it, playing mash or taking quizes, most of the time its this game called jetpack joy ride. Anyway i am writing this review for her after much begging from her. She is really impressed about how it works and etc...... her only complaints are: sometimes acts a little slow or freezes for a few seconds...not a big deal.....or how nasty the screen cover gets but nothing else. Super durable....she drops twice a day. With good case the screen shouldnt break but without one......it does....she had to get her screen replaced once but that was without a case on, lesson: ALWAYS WERE A CASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! battery lasts long time....mostly. over all we love it. By the way get a 16gb other wise you run out of room quick.
1	1343001600	I have not received my iPod and it has been over a month very disappointed because it was a birthday gift ruined
4	1342915200	My speakers broke the second day I had the IPod Touch 4th Generation... It was depressing but I definitely wanted a new one again.The slimness is really beautiful. I love how it feels so compatible and light on my hands.There are so many things you can do with it so it's absolutely worth the price.I'm a bit worried that something might happen to the new one but I got a case along with it. :)The sound quality is amazing with the headphones but when you play it loud, it's a bit blurry to me.Otherwise I definitely recommend it!! :D
5	1342915200	This is my first Apple product for personal use. I found this device wonderful to use, easy to understand, and incredibly smooth compared to my BB curve. I will probably go with an iPhone for my next phone.Since I went with the cheaper 8G iPod, I am having to learn how to use the cloud and apps to deliver what I need this to do without filling up my capacity. Since Amazon and Apple have cloud storage this was no problem. Pandora is handy so you don't have to fill the iPod up with music. I am saving that space for Amazon Kindle books.My main reason for purchasing the iPod was to have the Kindle Reader in my pocket. It was much smaller and a bit cheaper than the Kindle Fire.
5	1342915200	I received item fast so was very pleased with the shipment.  I am well pleased with the product at a reasonable price.
2	1342915200	shipped fast, came in almost new condition. but when i turned it on, there was a fuzzy streak all the way down the screen near the left hand side. i figured, maybe it will go away if i restart the ipod, but it didnt. several months later it is still there. otherwise in great condition though.
5	1342828800	This product alone has opened several new doors for me! Having all of the wonderful apps and none of the commitment of an iPhone is just heavinly.This device makes me feel as though I have truly moved on in life!
5	1342742400	I don't use the phone much and have a $15 monthly prepaid phone for that. However, I wanted internet access on the go to check & send emails, get on Facebook, search Google, watch videos on Netflix and...well you get the point. It's small and compact and does almost everything the iPhone does so long as I have free WI-Fi, which I get at work, restaurants, airports, Doctor offices and almost anywhere I go. Now, I not only have great music along with a great still and video camera, I have the internet too. And best of all, no monthly fees!Charge time lasts easily two or three days and recharges in a couple of hours with the USB cable shipped with the iPod. I recommend you purchase a case of some kind to go with it. Folio offers a good one, which you can order on Amazon.
5	1342742400	This little device is absolutely amazing.  My 4 yr old grandson showed me how to use the iPad when he was two and now his sister who is not yet 2 , is showing me up.  Figured I had better add the iPod Touch to my collection of computers, iPad etc. & try to stay ahead of these two little geniuses before I am too old to learn...(70+). This does everything that is advertised. I'm a little intimidated by its small size ...but then again, my small grandchildren intimidate me too! Great thing is, I can talk to and see them via Facetalk or Skype for free..someday when they're not 'busy'.  : ) Awesome *****
5	1342742400	This arrived in two days. It is my second one as I "gifted" my older one to someone else. I LOVE that it has a Kindle ap because I keep this in my purse or car pretty much at all times so I'm never without my favorite book.
5	1342742400	I was super nervous about making my first online purchase, especially since it was so expensive, but it went smoothly and I couldnt be happier! My purchase arrived early and in perfect condition. Thank you, Go-Auction!
5	1342656000	awsome product apple over did it this time acsess to the internet lots of songs to choose from thanks apple your the best.
5	1342656000	Love it, Love it , Love it. One of the best gifts I've ever received. My son and daughter bought it for me, along with a genuine iPod dock.I can't get enough of it, even after a year. I have wireless at home and a verizon wireless card, so I can take it with me. I use it for internet, GPS, iCloud, Hulu, Netflix, PBS, all kinds of stuff. I put a nice case and screen protector on it and it is still like new. Battery life is pretty good, too.Little story about the gift. Not only did my kids buy me the dock for the iPod, they also programmed all my favorite stations into it! I was very touched by that. It made the gift so personal.***Update...27 months after I got it-still no complaints. I use it daily. Battery life still strong. Screen is perfect (I'm very careful with my 'toys') and all the buttons work just fine. I know there are newer and 'better' models out there, but this has everything I need.
5	1342656000	This was the first time I have attempted to purchase something "used".  Had I not been told, I would of thought it was new though.  It was shipped promptly and as good as it was advertised to be.
2	1342656000	i was sitting down on my patio and had the ipod touch (4th generation) on my lap it fell not even 3 feet at a very slow rate, i was stationary, the screen had cracked in three places and is now frozen at a white screen. this was the first and only time it fell, i only had owned the ipod for 3 days. i paid nearly $200 and the thing can't even handle one tumble?also loading a new screen was laggy, perhaps it is a problem with my Internet i do not know.
5	1342656000	I ordered my Refurbished Ipod with a little apprehension.  I wasn't sure how "used" is might have been.  The product shipped quickly with First Class mail, arrived quickly and was in great condition.  My son could not have been happier with his new Ipod.
5	1342569600	It was in almost complately new condition! It is a great replacement for my old one. I love it! Thanks!
5	1342569600	My daughter loves it! It was a gift for her 11th birthday, and so far no problems. I'd like one for myself.
5	1342569600	This is boss. Nuff said. I love this so much you could never tell that its refurbished. Looks Brand New.  No scratches, Its awesome!
5	1342483200	wow great the best the camera its so good. i love it very much. this ipod is nice i use it for music.
5	1342483200	Es un hermoso artefacto electronico, se puede hablar a travez de skype, jugar muy novedosos juegos, escuchar musica, por el valor del mismo es algo muy indispensable en la vida cotidiana, se enciende rapido, se accesde a aplicaciones a la velocidad, lo recomiendo realmente bueno despues de todo es apple.
5	1342483200	This was a gift.  It's always a little scary buying electronics on the Internet, but this transaction was perfect and this iPod is getting HEAVY use by one particular 11 year old that I know!  I also purchased a third-party extended warranty on Amazon.com and was very pleased with the customer service I received in activating the warranty.
5	1342483200	The latest version of the Apple Touch is the perfect product for my 9yr old son.  He is too young for a phone, but enjoys having a single device for listening to music, playing games, and communicating via e-mail or text message with friends.  The Touch provides him such a device with wonderful resolution, numerous applications, and compact size.  As are all Apple products, the Touch is a user friendly, highly functional device that makes a great gift!
4	1342396800	iPod touch that I received is giving everything it advertised, (good) misunderstanding was on my part that I didn't read carefuly regarding the discription of the item.Again it was on time and function very good.becky
5	1342396800	As promised.  Delivery was on time.  Product was packaged well.  Ordered 2 of them, so far so good.Ordered gell cases and screen protectors (other suppliers on Amazon) all of which fit.  Easy to customize while using one iTunes account for the entire family.
1	1342396800	Ok I have never used amazon before but I know abuch of people that has so I oredered a Apple IPOD touch like almost a month ago That was my daughters b day present and now every time i contact him he gives me the run around
5	1342396800	Bought this for my 15 y/o daughter's birthday gift to replace her iPod nano 4th generation.  She loves all the features, as it can do so much more than just download iTunes.  She is a responsible teen, so I trust her, and she's having fun with it.
1	1342396800	This iPod touch was purchased to replace an older version that wouldn't hold a charge.This one is no better than my older one.I had always heard that you should let rechargeable batteries got completely empty before charging them because plugging them in every day wears out the battery.I plug this in and let it charge for almost 10 hours - until the battery shows full.Two days later I pick it up to use it for working out and the thing is deader than a doornail.I bought the extended warranty on the stupid thing so maybe I can exchange it for a product that actually works!Piece of sh*t.
4	1342396800	I love everything about my Ipod Touch. I can do so much with it, kind of crazy. Only knock i give it is the camera. I would think Apple would give it at least a couple of megapixel camera. The current one doesn't even have 1 megapixel?! But love everything else
5	1342310400	this is the best device for listening to the musicand all the entertaining. my husband has one, and he saysthat is better than an ipad, because is small and can be carryon a pocket.
5	1342310400	I researched and thought it might not have enough storage capacity for my kids to use.  Wrong!!!!!  8 gigs is plenty big enough storage for both of my kid's Ipods.  Why the spend the extra money for more storage when its a waste. It was $25.00 dollars cheaper on Amazon than any other place we looked at.  Great job Amazon!!!!
5	1342310400	Just as good as advertised. I can have as many songs as i would like now and listen to many songs and get the best sound around.
5	1342224000	My son loves his new iPod. Too bad his own mother can't use it that much. My son deletes my app for games every time I play it.
5	1342137600	My 9 year old daughter wanted one of these for Christmas, but I didn't think that she was really serious about getting one.  But I after she kept asking to see her cousin's Ipod Touch so much, I knew that I had to get one of own for her birthday.  I'm definitely getting my money's worth from this purchase.
5	1342137600	I got this for father's day, and cannot stop using it.  I can't believe I went this long without one
5	1342051200	This is a great product, i really like the way it looks like and the description of tools and functions. I purchased this as an anniversary gift for my boyfriend, i hope he likes it : he already has ipad and loves apple tecnollogy, I dont think 8GB its lot of space but its okey for around 900 songs. I really like the option to conect and download songs with wifi.Nice product.
5	1342051200	I bought this device for my 12 year old Grandson and he couldn't be happier. Of course he's already spent more on music and apps than the iPOd itself cost. All his freinds use iPod 4s to communicate and social network because it has built in WiFi you save the cost of a monthly cell phone plan. Personaly I just use my older Ipod for music and it serves me well but younger people are more connected and love these new iPods. If you read the listing information on Amazon you'll see how much this thing can do, it's way more powerful than the older iPods and is a good value considering all the things it can do.
5	1342051200	I purchased this iPod about one year ago.  I love this piece of electronics!!!!!I was originally looking for a new MP3 player and read a review of this iPod from someone else.  They said not to bother with other brands and just buy this iPod.I bought this iPod and I use it everyday!  I mean EVERY day!  I am a professional violinist and love listening to the music through my iPod.If you are hesitant about purchasing one of these, please DON'T be!  I know the feeling and I made a wise investment in this iPod.
3	1341964800	The function of the iPod is great.  It responds well and the screen is very clear.  It fits nicely in my hand and I can operate it with one hand.  That being said, the glass screen and chrome back plate are very fragile.  The back scratches and dents easily .  The iTunes software is not pleasant to deal with and sometimes remove music randomly or duplicate them without being prompted.  For an experience computer user, this is not a problem, but for a novice user, it can be very annoying.  I deducted one star for the iTunes software and another for the fragile exterior of the iPod.  If it wasn't for those two issues, I would rate the iPod touch at five stars.
5	1341964800	Bought this for my son's birthday and he loves it. He hasn't put it down since. There is so much to keep him entertained. I constantly hear him laughing. Many of the apps are free and those that aren't are only a $1 or so. I originally thought it was expensive but now think it's well worth the price.
5	1341964800	This itouch is great! With good looking and multiple functions. Love it! It has almost replaced my ipad. Hope to see the fifth generation.
3	1341878400	This new version of the ipod touch is very cool.There are two cameras one facing out and one facing in.The camera quality if fairly good and works great with facetime.If you plan to be downloading a lot of apps and movies and stuff I would get the 64gb device.This gaming and this device does lag a bit depending on the game but all in all it is very solid.With full brightness on you will only get 2 hours of life which is very disapointing.The  retina display is awesome.The device for me is a bit to thin unlike the new iphone this could fall out of your hands but I solved that with the griffin survior case.The web browsing is pretty solid.Its nothing like the ipad but it works.Usually I just use apps.I dont believe this device deserves five stars because of the battery life and the device lags a bit sometimes.But it is a great for music use and movies.
5	1341878400	I Bought A Brand New IPod Touch Never Used For An Extremly Good Price. No Scratches No Anything Ann It comes With The 1 Year Warenty Everything Came With The Ipod Headphones Charger And All For $130 nice deal
5	1341792000	The iPod touch (4th Generation) is a very good item.  The options are endless on the iPod from thousands of applications.
5	1341792000	Ok this ipod is nice, just one thing that really tipped me off. It was the price that had risen $10. The price was at first $185 for the 8gb. Then it went down $24, $174. I was saving money to buy it and I was at $80, then in a week it had went back to $184. So I decided to have my mother buy it now before price went up, AGAIN. I mean common. What did u think, if the price went down u think oh wow, now I want to buy it. Doesn't make sense.
5	1341792000	Hello Amazon.com :)I enjoy buying items from your website. I recently bought an Ipod Touch for my husband for a father's day gift. I asked him how he likes his ipod  & he said "how do I like it? This thing is freaking awesome :)"I think enough said for the review huh :)Thank You.
2	1341792000	I bought the Ipod for my mom as a Christmas gift. It can on time and was an easy, fast delivery.  However, the Ipod malfunction on the first day! The screen would blackout for no apparent reason. I reseted, updated and reformatted to see if that would work, I didn't. So I contacted amazon and told them the problem with Ipod. They replaced it. The new one hasn't had any problem so far.
5	1341705600	We gave the IPod touch to our grandson on his 7th birthday.  He used it  while waiting for flights to a cruise out of SanJuan.It was a lifesaver for his parents, keeping his interest during all the down times. A homerun for us too.
5	1341705600	iPod was better than expected, great price and fast shipping!!! Bought this item for my dad for Father's day and he is so happy with it.
5	1341619200	It was a great value.  It does everything it is supposed to do.  Works perfectly.  My High school son is very happy with it.
5	1341619200	The iPod came in 3 days!!! I am very pleased. The charger seemed a little hard to stick it in, but then it worked. I am very happy!! Plus, minimum scratches, but def. not visible! YAYY!
1	1341619200	Im going to keep this simple.  the device is great, but is flawed with a 0.3 Megapixel camera.  that's not a typo.  ZERO POINT THREE.  That's just a disgrace for Apple to cheap out so badly on a camera for a device like this.  Just crazy really.  im taking out 4 stars because of that.  USELESS camera!!!
5	1341619200	I finally broke down and bought an Apple product. The IPOD Touch happens to be my first one. The armband for my Zune HD fell apart, and it is nearly impossible to find another one to fit the Zune let alone other accessories. Since Microsoft doesn't make them anymore, I figured it was just time to move on because they are obsolete. Let me first say that the Zune was awesome; it gets 5 stars too. I got three hard years out of it and it's still going strong without a glitch. I do think that the IPOD is better, but the Zune HD is better for working out simply because I feel the Zune's shuffle function works better. It is also lighter. Other than that IPOD touch exceeds it in every way. It simply is more advanced. I find I use it for more than just workouts. I plug it in to my car and jobsite radio. I use it to search the internet, check e-mails, snap photos, etc. It's a great device and I think I may purchase more Apple products in the future. Oh, ITUNES is a lot better than the ZUNE Marketplace. It has way more songs and downloads are easy on my PC.
1	1341532800	I purchased a brand new Ipod 4th gen. 8gb from Amazon paid right at $200.00 for it in Feb 2012 was using it a week ago and the screen started turning white with lines going thru it called Amazon as it is still under warranty I was told they do not cover warranty I would have to call Apple called Apple was told to ship it to them for repair if it couldn't be repaired it would be replaced I received my unrepaired Ipod in the mail today and was informed it couldn't be repaired or replaced because it had been dropped or wet in which I know neither had happened it is in my purse in a case  with a screen protector at all times so now I am out $200.00 I will never purchase another Apple product or anything else from Amazon for all of the purchases I have made I would have hoped at least Amazon would stand behind what they sale I will make sure everyone I know hears of the service I have received I am disappointed it is not like I am a kid not taking care of their things I am a 57 year oldApple iPod touch 8 GB 4th Generation (White) - Current Versionthe link just shows you what it cost now I spent over $234.00 with the Ipod, case and accessories
5	1341532800	So fast, so cool! Great ipod! I really enjoy this sale. I definitely will come back if I will buy something again.
5	1341532800	My Ipod looks just about bran new, only like two little scraches, of course should be expected when you buy a referbished Ipod. But I love it, it was most definitly worth the money. i have been wanting one for a while and just could never get all of the money but on Amazon i bought a screen cover, a case, and the Ipod for way less then the price of a store.
2	1341532800	We purchased this Ipod to replace our Palm PDA we are not very santisfied with it at all the ipod dose not have very good setup for contacts,to dos,calender,on its own it makes you do all these things online my wife likes to do these things off line and with all the passwords to remember it just to complicated for us so we have found a way to use palm with windows 7 so we are back to the palmThe ipod is a good toy for videos,games but not a pda
5	1341532800	Traded my old 2nd generation for this one.  The price was right and many new or improved features.  I love the Ipod Touch.
4	1341532800	The apple iPod touch 4th generation is a combination of some of apple's best designs and features. I bought one from Best Buy 2 years ago. The iPod was a marvel for its time. It was one of the first apple devices to feature such a thin design and two cameras. Soon afterward though, the iPad and iPhone came out with better looks and better cameras (They also included more features). If you had asked me two years ago, I would have definitely recommended buying this product. However, I wouldn't do so today. It's not that I disliked this iPod or am an apple hater. I wouldn't recommend it because I am confident that a new iPod will be released this September. The reason for this is that apple has already skipped the upgrade one September because it came out with other creative products like the iPhone and iPad. Seeing that the iPhone and iPad are well ahead in their market, I believe that apple will only release a new iPod touch (and maybe a itouch XL?). Thus, I would wait till September to purchase the ipod touch, when, hopefully a new one will be released.If you disregarded my advice above, then let me provide you with a brief overview of the product:This is apple's thinnest iPod touch. I like this feature a lot because not only does it make the device incredibly portable, but it also adds a great look to the iPod.The dual cameras featured on this iPod allow it to be used with some of the newest apps designed for the iPhone 4S and the new iPad. Nevertheless, the cameras cannot be imported to larger screens--they are VGA quality and lack the megapixels required for creating sharp images.The chrome back on this iPod is one of its cons. Although it looks nice for maybe the first minute after purchase, it will easily scratch. Even if you clean it every night and put a case on it for almost all the time, it will still scratch. I am hoping to see a new back on the iPod touch 5th generation that will be made of the same material that the iPad backs are made of.This is a basic overview, I hope it helps.If you have any ideas about the IPOD TOUCH 5TH GENERATION, then please comment on this review.
5	1341532800	hi everyone this apple ipod touch 8GB(4th Generation)-blk i got this for my 12th yr old son for a gift for showing me tha he can do the best tha he can in school and on his tests in  school and at home so i said to him my word is born,and one he seen this apple ipod touch wow his eyes popped outta his head lol he never put it down since its been here lol this is really kool for kidz of these ages 11,12,13,14 lol this keeps them from trouble and it works smiles,i cant wait until the 5th generation comes out lol im gettin tha 1 for me o0o0o0o yes thank u amazon yall the best
5	1341532800	My travel is for personal purposes only so I don't need any kind of device that has programs such as MS Office or any specialty computer program.  I just need something compact for travel since I simply want to be able to check my bank statements/ensure direct deposit went in, send and receive messages, access the internet to look up local attractions, maps and local travel guides, checking the weather, maybe a Kindle download here and there, things like that.  I didn't want anything too involved or expensive (like the iPad) since I don't go on vacation to be connected all the time, but want now and then access to look things up or keep entertained if I'm waiting for something.  This device does all these things, but has so much more to it than that.  I'm pretty brand loyal to Apple, but wouldn't hesitate to bring up any problems I encounter.  So far I've had no problems with apps running awkwardly, crashing or any other things other people seem to be noting when looking at app reviews.  Many things are available offline once downloaded, such as travel guides or specific maps, which is great for someone like myself who is envious at times of people with smartphones and their ability to look things up on a whim (but I know I don't want a smartphone and the additional charges since it's not important for me to be THAT connected).  So many places have wi-fi availability that I really don't have any problems finding a place to use it.Favorite Apps:-ShopShop (free, shopping list maker with ability to have multiple lists with a simple layout and it remembers your items for future list making)-iHandy Level (free)-Weather Channel Max ($3.99, but I like the moving radar feature - free version is good though)-Pandora (free, and it will upload whatever you have on a Pandora account you already have)-Betty Crocker cookbook (free, and it's a full version)-Better Homes and Gardens cookbook (free for full version, $.99 to get a specialty add on with more recipes like slow cooker)-Discount Calculator (free, determine final price of a percentage off item)-Vocabology (free, daily new word and urban slang phrase)-National Geographic National Park Guide (free, able to add one specific park in depth information for free but would have to pay small amount for others)-Photo Collage (free, numerous layouts and ability to adjust collage frame size, can use pictures you upload from your computer or ones you take on the iTouch camera)-Gas Buddy (free)-Coleman Lantern (free, select from about a dozen different lantern models to turn it into a flashlight)-Zip code reference (free)-Hobby Lobby (free, coupon via the app vs. printing off of computer)-PBS (free, can watch a multitude of full length programs for free)Most major banks, credit card/financial companies and major retailers have a free app.  This is also reassuring to have while on vacation to ensure my automatic payments indeed went through successfully.  With all of the apps I ended up downloading I think I paid no more than $10.  If you're willing to put up with some ads many of the free versions will do just fine.I like that I can load my own pictures since I like to have some pictures with me of my travels to show others easily.  There are many free collage programs you can choose from to even make a collage and send it via e mail.  It's a neat feature for taking a few vacation pics on the iPod Touch itself and sending to family and friends.  It's not nearly as nice as the pictures I take with my DSLR camera, but in many instances has taken some nice shots I'm proud to send along.  I can load the DSLR shots onto this later if I want the really good shot available for viewing.I've played with the FaceTime a little bit with my niece and nephew for the novelty of it all.  I imagine teenagers would find that more fun than a 41 year old, but it is a neat feature.  If I didn't live near them I probably would find it more useful.I have a 2 GB shuffle with ability to use playlists for my music, but I added on a compilation mix of the 3 major types of music I like to listen to on the Touch just to have available if I'm using it while out and about.  When I go camping at the National Parks I can conserve my battery on the Touch by using the shuffle for music and the Touch for reference needs.The size of the iPod Touch is both a curse and a blessing at the same time.  Along the curse side I wish it was more along the size of a 4x6 picture which would be slightly smaller than the Kindle Fire, but a little bigger than it currently is.  Its ability to be taken anywhere easily (vs. something even like the iPad) makes it a blessing.  I've heard rumors here and there from family, friends and some internet articles that Apple is looking to come out with something that could be considered an "iPad mini" or "iPod Touch max" in the near future too.  I would certainly jump on that opportunity in an instant and is ultimately the device I'm seeking to have.My only regret about this purchase is that I didn't order the 32 GB.  I thought about it briefly, but figured that I'd only be loading on a few things.  Wrong - once I got this in my hands and realized all the things I could easily do with it I wished I had ordered the 32 GB.  Had it come in a 16 GB version that would have been a no-brainer purchase.  That being said, I can always temporarily take off some apps I'm not using as much, take some pictures off, put shorter playlists on and things like that to conserve space yet ultimately still have everything available.  I know this version of the iPod Touch has been out for about a year now so Apple's close to being due for a new version and I will then order one with a larger memory and hopefully it will be the rumored mid size version several of us have been hearing about.

5	1341273600	i really love this product. my grandma bought it for me as a reward for helping her around her house. i previously had a 2nd generation ipod touch, and man is it a big upgrade! i started playing with it right away, and it comes with a fully charged battery which was awesome!! im completely pleased with it. the ONE and ONLY thing i wish apple would do is offer a 16 gig. because personally, 32 is WAY too much for me, and 8 stresses me out just slightly because i have to worry about it filling up. 16 is the perfect amount i think...but thats not a negative on the ipod, thats a negative on apple itself!!! but still totally awesome. im so happy :D
5	1341273600	I love iPod 4th generation. Front and back camera, wow! Watching movies, or taking videos, store musics or listen to it became very easy. Everything in one place including calendars, apps, musics, books, and what not. It just awesome.
5	1341187200	i'm totally addicted to this thing! i prided myself on being an Apple holdout and bucking the trend, but i finally decided i would dip my toe in the water with this touch.  however, i'm more pleased than i thought i would be -with the right app it does everything the iPhone can do...even make and rec' phone calls and download apps.  i use for everything but music all you need is WiFi so no data plan necessary...well i occasionally listen to a little streaming music.  even can do facetime and iMessage with my iPhone buddies so they are a bit jealous because i don't have to have an annoyingly expensive data plan.  the price here was cheaper than on the apple site so i was definitely pleased when purchased. however, you could get it engraved on apple, but since most likely you'll get a case that would cover anyways wasn't worth the extra $.  oh one last thing you can utilize the recovery application so if it's lost or stolen you can find it just like with any of the other Apple products. just know when you see the 20% battery life left you better get to an outlet pronto because it will cut off soon after...not a complaint just an observation.
2	1341187200	When I first got it I thought it was great. It has plenty of great apps and accessories. However, I can no longer recommend the iPod Touch. It has a slow processor which prevents it from running well. I would however, recommend the iPhone 4S which I also own. Here are some problems I am having now. I'm running iOS 5.1.1 (the latest version):1. When I get emails I will get a notification, but when I go to view them it says "This message has no content."2. Some common apps won't even start due to the small processor of the iPod Touch such as:-Draw Something-Gmail (So no email for me)-Uno3. Even if some apps start some apps such as Plague Inc. and Scribblenauts Remix will randomly crash.4. Apple has the nerve to charge $30 for support after owning it for a certain amount of time.5. The phone on the iPhone isn't the only thing it's lacking. It doesn't have a GPS, compass, high quality camera, or 3G.Conclusion: Save your money and either get the Samsung Galaxy MP3 Player or an iPhone. Virgin Mobile now has iPhones. Virgin Mobile is one of the cheapest carriers that isn't prepaid.
3	1341187200	I bought a new 4th Gen and what I found was that the sound quality was crap. I plugged it into my stereo and it did not sound as good as my 2nd gen. So I did some research and found that the audio chipset is a cheaper one, and that the older iPods sounded clearer. I even had a dream where someone was telling me that my new iPod is made of cheap stuff. So I eventually swapped it for a secondhand 2nd Gen, which is much more responsive too. The buttons on the 4th Gen don't work all the time, it's wierd. And it crashed easily too. Having said that, the video camera and new weather features are pretty good.
1	1341100800	i hate it it is a real piece of junk i cant believe i wasted my money. DO NOT BUY
5	1341100800	This ipod works great and it's everything I expected. For the price, can't beat it! The front and back camera's were the selling point for me.
5	1341014400	iPod touch 4 is a very nice smart device, very costumizable. With the apps available at apple store you can complete it capacities to wathever you need.WiFi connectivity allows you to browse the web, listen music and download content.Recommended.
4	1341014400	I love my new iPod, but only wish I had gotten the one with more memory.  Don't be fooled when they say the 8GB model can hold 2,000 songs.  Unless they are all less than 2 minutes, I seriously doubt it.  More like 750-1000.  Still a lot of music.  Figured out how to use it relatively quickly.  I am really enjoying it!
5	1341014400	I ordered this iPod as a gift for my daughter.  It arrived with all packaging as a new iPod Touch.  Works great and will make for a very happy birthday.
5	1341014400	I am very happy with this purchase.  It works as expected and was a good value.  I would purchase this again.
5	1340928000	I recently updated my Ipod to the Ipod Touch (4th generation).  Before this Ipod, I had the Ipod Touch (3rd generation).  To be perfectly honest I cannot believe how similar they are.  I understand it is just an upgrade, but for the money I wish I could have just stuck with my old one.  Even though I think they are very similar, I really like the camera feature that the 4th generation has on the front of the Ipod.  I do not take a great deal of pictures with it, although it does take very nice ones.  The camera on the Ipod is very clear.  It is much clearer than the camera on my phone.  The only drawback is that is does not have internet installed directly on it, otherwise I would be able to upload pictures instantly.  This Ipod is a little thinner than the last generation which is very nice, I also like the accessories that go along with it.  I am the type of person who likes to accessorize with my electronics and the new Ipod really gives you the chance to do so.  No matter what I do not think I could live without an Ipod because I use it so frequently.  I am glad I purchased my new Ipod for the fact that I can listen to music no matter where I am or what I am doing.
5	1340928000	My kid's birthday will be unforgetable, he got his iPod Touch just in time (Great service -as usual- by Amazon) for his birthday party and present. He loved it!.I had an iPod touch 2nd generation but this newest generation (4th) is even Better and nicer!, started to set it up together with my kid and I was surprised of all the new stuff on latest iOS software and applications. Now I'm looking forward to get the iPhone 4S or even wait for the 5th generation. Apple have made excellent products with iPod's, iPhone's and iPads.
5	1340928000	I purchased this online and got it quicker than the estimated due to arrive day. The set up is super easy for a non - technical person. With the battery charged I was good to explore this device. The download apps are super easy! So far I got Pandora and love it! Onto a book I download and love how the "book" feels so real, with the font and turn of the "pages". Cartoon Network sweet for the little one perfect, picture to watch. Just a couple minutes ago I got a game and love it even though my main reason for my purchase was for an MP3 player with added features. Unbelievable! Its a must have. Three hours out of the box and I'm in love!!!
5	1340928000	I love my new Apple iPod touch! It works awesomely and the only complaint I have is that you have to either buy an iTunes gift card or enter your credit card number in order to download any apps, even if they are free.
5	1340928000	the is a really great buy you get it refurbished likde i did you will get your money's worth. five stars all the way!!!
4	1340928000	This was for a gift and it sure did not disappoint.  I had tried it at the store and it was definately a good deal.  I do recommend this product if you don't mind paying a little extra.
5	1340841600	I bought my ipod about a year ago and I LOVE IT! It is well worth the money you can do soo many things from watching movies, playing songs, and playing games.
5	1340841600	Usually in my reviews I try to find one thing wrong with the product because usually its not very hard to do. But with this I just couldnt find one I love this product 100%. It runs very fast, it shoots great video, and I love the gaming. The best way to discribe this is to just say THIS THING ROCKS!
5	1340841600	My daughter loves all the things she keeps dicovering on her new iPod.She loves the camera especially.  I think I picked a wonderful gift!
4	1340755200	i bought this product for my younger sister. she graduate from collage. she like it very much. very good quality and package. I would like to introduce it to my friend.
5	1340755200	The  iPod touch is awesome! It was just what I wanted! My iTunes and games synced without any problems, it's like having your computer at your finger tips.
5	1340755200	this was a gift for my daughter's 10 year old birthday.  she is sooooo happy with it.I would recommend this to anyone!
2	1340755200	Product that was shipped had a terrible battery life.  Also, some of the numbers and letters on the keypad do not work.  Clearly they sent a defective product.
5	1340668800	Ok.  I wanted to pick one up for my daughters birthday.  After going to two box stores where the price was higher then the online price i tried to order online and pick up in store same day.  I was told by the store manager it could take up to 2 weeks for the order to process.  After the wasted time and gas i came home and went to amazon and ordered the ipod, case, and screen protectors for less than the price of the ipod at the store.  Amazon prime has worked out for us.  Best price i cold find.
5	1340668800	Omg this perfect exactly wut I wanted and expected. I wus goin crazy waitin 4 dis and now that I have I am very satisfied. If u r thinkin about buying I completly recommend this product.
5	1340668800	very nice my son loves it he is very happy with it he gets all the free apps and video chats with out a problem nice product
5	1340582400	My son loves this IPod, no complaints so far, he has it for over a year and plays with it every day, good quality and resistant.  Fast delivery as always! Will def recommend.
5	1340582400	THIS WAS A GIFT FOR GRANDSON AND HE IS LOVING IT ALOT.  NOW MY GRANDDAUGHTER WANTS ONE TOO.GUESS I WILL MAKE ANOTHER PURCHASE.
5	1340582400	What else is there to say.  Fast, perfect size, and easy to use.  Purchased this as a birthday present  for my 11 y/o daughter. Sharing apps with my iphone through the computer was very easy.  Parental controls work perfectly, and she loves it.
3	1340582400	As iPods go, it does what it advertises : plays music and video, wifi-connectivity, gaming, ect. So in those respects, im happy with it.My gripes with it, however.. are the battery life and the preloaded software.Battery : Its advertised as "up to 40 hours on a single charge", however, im only seeing about 1/2 of this at the most. I will admit that i dont fully turn off my ipod after use, as i prefer to lock it (put it in "sleep mode") when im not using it. However, i dont think that would lead to a 50% drop in advetised batter charge time. Some drain is to be expected with it always being semi-on, of course.. but not by 1/2. Interestingly enough, on my old 2nd gen ipod touch, i had the batter replaced via a 3rd party repair service, and it quite a bit longer then the origional did, even longer then the old battery was advertised to last, as new. So battery life is still something it seems apple skimps on a bit.Now to the preloaded software. Its embedded into the device, which means you cannot delete it, even if you never use it. This takes up space (my advertised 8gig ipod is actually only 6.5 gigs, because the software takes up 1.5 (roughly) gigs of space). Some of the software is potentially quite usefull (gps, note taking, ect) but id like the ability to choose what i want on my device, not have apple force me to carry programs i dont want/use, and thus eat up space i could devote to my music and whatnot.So with those 2 issues in mind, im rating this a 3/5. Id give it a 3.5, but amazon dosnt allow votes in 1/2 stars.
2	1340582400	THIS IS IPOD TOUCH (4TH GEN) I BOUGHT AND IT FEELS SO SLOW THAT AFTER EACH TAP OR CLICK IT NEED TO THINK FOR LITTLE BIT BEFORE IT DOES IT.
5	1340582400	Love this Ipod one of the best buys i have had it was only a few dollars cheaper than my local walmart but i recieved it in a timly manner. Considering i ordered around Christmas and everywere was sold out
5	1340496000	This is the best thing evr truly.  I rate it 9999999 stars.  It's so good, it's better than m&ms telling skittles to taste the rainbow!!!
5	1340409600	(i had a itouch 2g, and have used my nephews itouch 4g)i remember using my cousins 2nd gen itouch and completely fell in love with it. i am a big YouTube user, and i love to surf the web. The itouch is capable of doing all that and more with the millions of apps available. youtube is 100% smooth and user friendly, and IOS is easy to use, simple is always better. Everything seems to work so smooth and respond at the first touch. The retina display is absolutely stunning, you can barely see any pixels. the web is smooth of course, but it does lack flash support so you don't get a full web-load when you try to view a flash packed site. I have officially moved from using itunes to using amazon MP3, and how convenient it is that amazon released their MP3 app for IOS. The camera isn't great but just decent (especially not so great in doors). The iphones camera is one of the few advantages of actually having a iphone. the only real down side is that memory is limited to the model you buy (8GB,32GB, 64GB- no micro-sd). the price tag on this little powerful device is a steal, you just CANNOT go wrong with all you get for less than $200.
1	1340409600	Live by the Walled Garden, Die by the Walled Garden.Apple assumes you have/want an Apple ID and computer with iTunes to use an iDevice. In my experience (3x), you have to connect it to the mothership for any functionality (ie. to browse the net). Others issues: No free (Gnu/GPL) software, cannot install apps from the net, Apple can remotely disable apps/media, no sharing music or books, devices tied to Apple ID.Have to tether it at least once (to connect to the mothership) to do anything. 1984 Irony anyone?
5	1340409600	i bought the item used, but it came newer than i expected barely any scratches. I expected something full of scratches for the price i paid for but it was gently used and came with everything.
5	1340323200	The iPod itself was fantastic! Though it was wrapped in only bubblerap is ok. The only minor detail in the USB cord when connecting into the iPod it is too tight of a fit and when disconnecting the same cord the it came apart a bit and I was able to see the wires inside the small casing. Other then the cord (of which I could care less) the iTouch is great and am glad to have bought one from UMS!
5	1340323200	Very very happy with my purchase.  The ipod arrived as described with not a scratch on it.  It's great & at a good price!  Thanks.
5	1340323200	Got the ipod touch in record time and it is in nearly perfect condition! If it wasn't missing the box it could almost pass for brand new except for a few barely noticeable scratches on the corners. Next time I need an ipod I'm buying from here again!
5	1340323200	It is a replacement of lost iPod. My 4th purchase. Excellent computer device. I take it everywhere. It is a small version of iPad. I love it.
5	1340323200	this was a great product except the USB cord did not work. i am sure they will handle this problem in a speedy and efficient fashion.
5	1340323200	I recieved this product within 5 days of ordering it. I am very pleased with the appearence & would definitely buy from UMS again. Thanks for the great service!
5	1340323200	I use this for everything except phone calls. Frees up my cell phone so it's battery isn't drained. Holds all my music and I can multi task and view pages clearly. Nice crisp color and clarity. An I-phone is nice but I like having all these functions separate from my phone.
5	1340323200	I should have bought this a yr ago! First "toy" I've bought in many years.  Love Facetime and Skype.  Playing music is just a bonus.
5	1340236800	I got this iPod as a gift, and I am so pleased with it!  I've never had a problem with Apple's products, and hopefully I never will.  I've had this iPod for almost a month and I haven't had a single problem with it.  No crashing, no nothing.  It's faster and the screen is extremely smooth.  It's pretty similar to the last iPod touch model (3rd Generation), except the camera/camcorder is a nice feature, the quality isn't really the greatest on this, but it's fair.  Of course the feature of being able to listen to iHeart radio, Pandora, etc. while doing other things on the iPod is a huge plus that the 3rd generation doesn't have.  I would definitely suggest this as a gift for a teenager, or even someone pre-teen.  Of course, 8GB isn't a whole lot (especially when it comes to games), but if you're just starting out with an iPod, then it should be fine.  I've been getting by with 8GB and I'm cool with it.  And another big plus for teenagers is that you can go to the mall and they have several kiosks in the hallways that specialize in iPod touch cases.  They have TONS of different cases, whether you're looking for style, protection or whatever.  They're about 15 dollars, which isn't bad considering that the ones Apple sells are $30!  That's another thing, these iPods and their sync cords are pretty durable, but if something needs to be replaced because you were too rough, it's going to cost a mint.  Apple is infamous for their ridiculously high-priced items.  But despite their high prices, I must admit that this product is pretty awesome.
5	1340236800	i use mine every day and i have apps on it so i can text people i even can make calls.... no monthly billing and i love it. the only problem i have is the camera the camera is crap on mine all the pictures i take looks like a three year old painted them... FAILURE. but over all i can get enough of apple iPods and products
5	1340236800	The product came very protected , came on time and works perfectly.Before i purchased I made some comparison with difent stores and I found the cheapest in Amazon. My fisrt thoughts were about the quality but after I received , I was so amazed , this is a good product.I recoment it.
5	1340236800	This iPod touch is way better than any other iPod. The white one especially. I bought this iPod because I wanted to upgrade my first gen iPod touch. A few of the things I wanted to upgrade is having a camera, having a white iPod, having face time, and getting a few other products as well.It takes some time to set the settings and all, when your done with that, it's like you have a futuristic devise in your hands! you can do unlimited tasks with the 4th gen iPod touch!
5	1340236800	We ordered the used (like new condition) white ipod touch, 8 gb, We received it right on time and everything was in great shape, worked wonderfully!
5	1340150400	I love this product and to get it cheaper AMAZING.I can do research for school,watch YouTube,and find photos.I also like to take photos when I go on field trips
5	1340150400	I ordered this product once before and it shipped and was delivered really fast but sadly I broke it. So I ordered a new one because I didn't feel like having the old one fixed. It took a while to ship and then it never arrived even after waiting a long time after the date that it was supposed to be delivered. I contacted Amazon and they were great. They shipped a replacement free of charge with one day shipping. Love Amazon's care and service in this matter. Amazon is always the best place to shop. Don't go anywhere else when you can go to Amazon.
4	1340150400	Got this product for my nephew, and even though i messed up and got him a 8GB instead of 32GB, he was very pleased and still did not want to exchange it! Good Product, Great Price, Fast shipping.Thanks
4	1340150400	[...] Beautiful just like purchase from apple and sexy just like the ad"s! love it! yayay haha have fun with this amazing product!
5	1340064000	Bought this for my mom for a mothers day present a while back, she had told me she wouldn't use it but now she won't put it down. She has all her music, podcasts and games on it.
2	1340064000	The battery depleted very fast despite newly purchased.buying ipad would be the better option.I don't if it normal that I have to charge the battery after 3 hours from usage.
5	1340064000	Me gusto mucho es un buen producto y el vendedor es bien confiable, me llego el mismo d&iacute;a que me dijeron que me iba a llegar .ES BIEN CONFIABLE.
5	1339977600	Purchased as a gift for a grandchild for graduation. She has several Apple products and rates this one very high.
5	1339977600	I  brought it for mu nephew he loves it so much i had to buy one for my niece thanks
5	1339891200	I got this a year ago. best thing i ever bought. i actually had dropped many many times without a scratch (once from a 7 feet drop) .i dont get why people are saying its fragile. the things you can do with it. just amazing! cant live without it. i sold mine because i needed the money for something, but that was a HUGE mistkae. i am buying another one again! this is a must have item!
4	1339891200	Amazon has a great price on the fourth generation ipod. I would like to see some of the typical complaints that we've all had with the third and fourth gen ipods addressed in the next one. You can't beat this price though.
2	1339891200	bought this iPod for my Daughter who just turned 14 only lasted her three days before it slipped out of her hand and fell 2 feet screen cracked.  I had bought the cover for it but unfortunately it did not arrive on time....no more iPods for me.
4	1339804800	I bought my iPod touch and seriously liked it. Heck, I'm making this review on it now! I do like how it can practically do anything except calls, there are apps for texting, and all that stuff. There are a few bugs, though, however. The battery life is terrible, forcing me to recharge this thing almost everyday. I get kicked out of apps frequently, and things lag alot. Also, if you get the 8 gb, storage is used up Pretty quick, as you can only use about 6 of that 8 gb.
5	1339804800	The iPod touch 4g in white is amazing!!! The white color looks cool. This is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to pay for an iPhone, but still enjoy many common features. It has everything you need to be social. The only bad thing but still tolerable is the Wi-Fi speed and connection. It's not like an iPhone where you can get internet no matter where you are. But it is still a fantastic device worth the money.
3	1339804800	the product contained high levels of damage on the ipod the upper right corner was chipped off and the back was scratched everywhere the ipod worked as planned.
5	1339718400	Hi, I bought the ipod touch 4g 8gb and it was tatally awesome!You may want to get a silicon case for it.It has a GPS a compass,facetime 2 cameras so much more.It is just darn cool.
5	1339718400	It was delivered quickly and in great condition. It works well and I'm very pleased with my purchase. Glad I got it.
3	1339718400	The I-Pod is a great piece of electronics, but the one we received was pretty worn out on the back.  It had quite a bit of scratch marks on the back.  We were lead to believe it was one that was just returned or had a partial open box.  It came by itself in a small box.  Not really happy with the transaction.Tomas Macias
5	1339718400	The product was just as it was described and for a great price, not to mention the fact that it arrived very fast! I love my iPod Touch. Thank you!
5	1339632000	This was for my 12 year old grandson and he loves it. It was just as good as it was described. Shipping was fast
5	1339545600	I was worried about ordering a refurbished product, but I am very happy with my choice.  The iPod was wrapped nicely in bubble wrap and looks almost new!! Would definitely buy again!!
5	1339545600	UPDATE: I now give the item five stars because it has lasted over a year through some pretty rough and extensive play... It appears it going to last a while and we're going to our money's worth out of it..Shopped around town and the retailers and big box marts couldn't touch Amazon's price.... My daughter loves it and so far it's been a great product...I love one of the games we put on it and seriously thinking about getting me one.... Not often do I applaud technology but I have to here....Amazon and their dealers are great....
5	1339545600	I received my Ipod in great conditions. Tha package was complete. It is a good choice if you want to start knowing "apple world"
5	1339545600	I bought this iPod in last month for my daughters birthday gift. It was a HUGE hit at her party! We ordered the white iPod touch! I love the new look!I love the FaceTime feature! It allows me to call her and see her like webcam!!! ( you have to both have FaceTime though)I also wasn't ready to buy her an actual phone so I went with this iPod bc you can download a text app and the kids are happy!I love this product and would recommend to anyone looking!!! Good luck!
4	1339459200	As everyone knows, IPOD is the best MP3 player. There is nothing much bad about this item. The back side is very shining and can easily get finger prints. It also can get scratches with a little bit of friction in contact with other surfaces. Immediately buy the protective case before using it.
5	1339459200	This is what my son has to say-As many people say, the iTouch is very entertaining. However, I'd like to differ. Though there are many apps, music and others, the iTouch just isn't the same as a PS3 or X Box. Most of the games on the iTouch are all repetitive, but, on the stationary consoles, games, like Halo or MW3, there are a great variety of things to do. In Angry Birds, the birds just don't seem to keep track of their eggs. There are also a small amount of controls on the iTouch. Angry Birds are just launched and tapped on. Your character in Temple Run can only go left, right, up, or down. Driving games are just not the same on the iTouch as they are on the PS3, X Box, etc. On these stationary consoles, there's much more of a challenge to the player(s).Please consider this, and if you do, "THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION."-Katniss Everdeen
5	1339372800	I love my ipod. I take it with my everywhere.Great Great Great for games apps music and more I love mines soo much!!!
3	1339372800	We have a 10 year old girl who got one of these from her grandpa, it plays games fine and we put her music on it but it dosent even get close to the 7-40 hours of use amazon says.The good: Sharp & bright display, fast response to the touch screenThe Bad: You are stuck using itunes to do everything, all the songs and videos first have to be imported then you can copy them. We have several android tablets & phones and they require no special software, you can copy music & videos to or from any computer.The battery life is poor. An hour of use before school, an hour after school, then playing with it in the car on the way to dinner and it will be dead before we get home that evening. She also has a 10" samsung galaxy, she can use it the same amount in a day and have 45% battery left at bedtime and of course the screen is 4 times the size.Since she got this as a gift, I guess it's fine, if your buying one used at a good price, it would be ok. But if I had to buy one new I would not buy an Ipod like this. I would likely get some type of android touch player, they seem less expensive and easier to use with out needed to download itunes everywhere.
5	1339200000	Very easy to use. Haven't put it down since I bought it. Great item. Waiting to add things to my device.
4	1339113600	ok, I am not the biggest Apple fan boy...I admit that. I also admit that I am impressed with the way this buggers work.Very rarely any glitches, freezes or any problems like that (compared to other gadgets I bought). The battery life is beyond the believe of someone who uses none Apple smartphones for years yes I know that this isnt a Smartphone). The shear amount of software available for the Apple products are crazy.And with a little bit of time and knowledge you can free your little fruit from its restraints.All in all  overpriced, very restricted in its original from but also impressive piece of technology.
5	1339113600	i have never owned any apple products before. I really was plaesed how this ipod work and all the contents APPs and the video chatting i really recommend this item. I believ everybody should own one at everyhome in MEXICO.Thanks.
5	1339113600	This is my 3rd iPod Touch this year, my kids each wanted one after I received mine.  It workd really well and is easy to use.  My only problem is with iTunes.  I don't like it mainly because it's not user friendly.  Other than that I really enjoy my iPod Touch...
4	1339027200	Basically the Touch is now an I-phone without the phone.  Overall, after a few weeks, pretty happy with the I-pod Touch, for all the reasons others have stated, but with TWO major exceptions.1. You do NOT get 8GB of storage, as advertised.  As others have pointed out, you only get about 6.5GB right out of the box, because of "system" stuff taking up space.  So that is a bit misleading, to claim 8GB available.2.  Cheaply made, as a physical item.  First time my son dropped his, the screen cracked.  For the amount of profit Apple is making by using Chinese sweatshops, rather than employing Americans, you would think they could make a more durable product.  It is not cheap -- considering the price you pay.  Good folks at Apple store gave him a GriffinSurvivor Extreme Duty Case and Belt Clip for iPod touch 4Gfor his replacement Touch, and I bought one for mine as well.  The Survivor is a fantastic case.  Spend the extra $20 to protect your investment in your I-pod Touch.
5	1338940800	Les escribo desde Merida, Venezuela, el producto llego super rapido a esar de todo el proceso de envios por lo lejos que vivo, el producto llego en una caja bien protegida, tal cual como lo describio el vendedor, recomiendo 100% al vendedor, Saludos.
4	1338940800	I happen to have both the iPod and iPhone. And let me tell you, the iPod is not as good as the iPhone.For starters, it's a lot slower and the camera isn't half as good.In addition, I honestly prefer the back design of the iPod 3 gen because this feels too "unsleek".
5	1338854400	product works flawlessly for half the price of a new one, got lost in mail but eventually came in, still all in all very satisfied
4	1338854400	The best i geted for my dougther is the best product if you are i Apple fan and best quality lover has all the new features from the ios 5 also has a better camera that the ipad 2 , has the face time and imessage on it she is very happy with it
4	1338854400	The ipod touch may seem exepensive, but once you get the feel of it, you'll know you got your money's worth.Pros: It is easy to figure out, even a child could figure it out.-Games and apps all have free versions (with a few exeptions)-The battery life at full charge can last up to 6 hours straight, depending on how you use it-There is no "I accidently bought something," you have to double click the price icon and enter your apple IDCons: The screen gets sticky after about a weeks usage, but you can wipe it off with a glasses towel-You don't get full storage capacity, I bought an 8 GB, and 2 GB's were already taken up.-It comes with a camera, but the camera dosen't take good up close pics, unless you're outdoors in the sunlight or any other well lit area.Overall: I would give this product an seven out of ten, and if I may a suggestion; Buy the 8 GB, you still get a lot of storage space, and well it's at least 100 dollars cheaper than the others.Thanks!
5	1338854400	II bought this ipod for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. She is on it constantly and has not one complaint.
5	1338768000	Well i really liked the product! though the screen cracked in my bag three weeks after i had gotten it :c BUT it still works
5	1338768000	If you are passionate about music then this is just for you, also there are features like nike+ipod where you can actually synchronize your workouts with your ipod depending on your needs of-course, and then there is my favorite, you can actually access the wi-fi network with this device. For me I would give this product 10 stars but I can only give it five.
5	1338681600	im getting this for my birthday and my frendz said that its cool andstuff like that i would get it!
5	1338681600	This is my daughter's IPOD TOUCH.  She bought it with her own money.  8MB is fine, but probably would have been smarter to go to the 32MB.  But since she bought it with her own money and she wanted it NOW and not later (needed to save more for a larger unit), it's just fine.  Works great!  She loves it!
5	1338681600	I was very reluctant about this seller, but after I received the ipod touch. It wasn't like new, like it was described but like Brand New. Very happy with the product. I was looking for a used one to replace the original battery on my sons ipod touch I think I'll keep it as is. Thank You seller whoever you are.
5	1338595200	everything went fine - very pleased with item and delivery - got this for my grandkid and he loves it -would not hesitate to buy again !
5	1338595200	Arrived in time for daughters 12 birthday. She has been able to download apps and runs smooth. Covered it with otter box defender from amazon to avoid a cracked screen as mentioned in other reviews. Would purchase again from this site.
5	1338595200	ive been waiting 4 3 days and finally i got my i pod!it does everything the info says and more!rite now im watching frenemies :) i kno i missed the premier so yeah :D
5	1338595200	This 4th generation Ipod is simply a marvel when it comes to technology and user friendliness. In the past I have stayed away from Apple products because of the perceived cult culture, narrow software application and non discounted pricing structure.All of those concerns, go out the window when you view the screen resolution and realize how fantastic the product really is. The face to face, wireless printing and internet access features are just great.
5	1338508800	Bought two for my ten year old grandsons, who are now the happiest kids in the world!@!  I am now the BEST GRANDMA ever!
5	1338508800	Loved this product got it for my cousin it is awesome..When we received it we got so excited because I got a white one and got her the black one and its just amazing..
5	1338508800	This was the first apple product I've ever purchased and I am 100% satisfied with it. It looks sleek, it feels correct in the palm of my hand, and the battery has been reliable to last several days at a time. I recommend this product.
4	1338422400	This item is very cool! i purchased it last month and it has worked very well! i definately recommend it to anyone that wants a nice mp3 and also watch videos in a good resolution.
5	1338422400	This is sos so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so soo so soooooooooooo AWESOME!!!!
3	1338422400	overall this product is ok i believe that apple should make known that some featers in the machine  do not in fact operate as a normal person would expect  ie face time does not repeat does not work with any degree of reliability my i touch 4th gen . has experienced failure after failure when it  u tries to use face time
4	1338422400	I was looking for a device to play audio books.  It does that plus so much more that I think I may now be ready for a smart phone.  From what I have discovered so far all it lacks is the phone!  To use most of the neat features you have to be in a wi-fi zone.  The good part is that there are no fees involved.  Can do most of the stuff you can do on a laptop.  I'm frustrated at times with the mini keyboard.  My fingers always hit the wrong keys.  Works better in the horizontal position, but that isn't an option on every feature.  Still need to decide whether I'm interested in using the "cloud."
2	1338422400	I hope someone reads this and calls me to replace it.  I received my I-POD touch and it was fine.  However I left it in my pickup during the day when it was hot outside.  I only had the thing for a day.  When I got in my pickup the screen was cracked right down the middle top to bottom.  I guess the heat must have broke it.  It still works and I don't know that it will have issues.  Does what I want it to but wish the screen wasn't broken.  Good device but quality is a question.  Its paper thin compared to a phone and could be thicker w/ better quality.
5	1338422400	Having an I-Pad and not really wanting 4-G, I got the I-Pod touch for wireless and blue tooth capabilities for music.  It's a great device for the Apple-savvy user and shares almost all of the apps with the I-Pad.  Wireless connections are seamless, also.  Watch the way the  music is synched, though, if you buy a smaller capacity device.  If music is synched without reducing to 128 bit, the memory fills up quite quickly.
1	1338336000	Seems like it came used by some guy name Eric (It shows when I linked it with my computer). There are a few scratch at the back. It's slow, take some times to respond (I haven't installed many apps, and none of them is a large file), menu and sleep button don't work sometimes, and power can not be charged in occasionally.
5	1338336000	Its a ipod touch need i say more. Oh Fast shipping from Amazon and was a gift for a grandmother who loves her new ipod
5	1338336000	I bought this for my daughter.  She just loves it!  There are so many things she can do with it.  I did not have a problem with the seller and it was in good condition.  I will definately use them again.
3	1338336000	I've had iPods for as long as I've had mp3 players. I love music, and iPods have fueled this love for me ever since I got my first one, 8 years ago. However, their build quality has been deteriorating rapidly as of late, IMHO.After my iTouch 2g was stolen, I bought this model (8gb), and said goodbye to the glass covering the screen less than 2 hours after unboxing it. It did not just crack, it SHATTERED. Completely. I kid you not, it fell from a height of 1.5 feet. Onto marble, yes, but still - 1.5 feet?! I dropped my 2g a countless number of times! Onto concrete, asphalt, wood - and it never cracked - I dropped it from much greater heights. Yes, I am a clumsy bastard but I expect a certain level of ruggedness from my devices. I am used to dropping my phone - a HTC android - from about 5 feet, from my bunk bed and it never got even a blemish. It's just Apple's greed or pride or whatever the hell it is that prevents them from using Gorilla glass in their devices.Disillusioned in iPods in general. After that happened, I bought a nano 16gb 6gen which gave me the white screen of death 2 months after I bought it. Moved on to a Samsung Galaxy S 4.0 now, and I love it. Anyway, that's beside the point.If you are as clumsy and careless when it comes to electronics as I am - take this into consideration. DO NOT use it without a protector/case because the screen replacement costs $100. Then again, one is forced to wonder what the hell is the bloody point of releasing/buying a device that requires a case in order to be used safely. What is the point of Apple's oh-so-attractive sleek design when it's destined to be hidden behind a layer of ugly silicone.My old iTouch never needed a case, then again its screen didn't shatter after the slightest drop.I will not be buying another Apple product any time soon on principle. Why support them with my cash when they are not using it to build a higher quality product?
5	1338249600	My daughter had a first generation iPod touch and when my wife and I upgraded our iPhones we sent them to Gazelle.com and got about $100 for each and used that money to get my daughter the 4th gen iPod touch.  She loves it the screen is much better and all her games play on it and the best part for her is having her own camera and FaceTime to talk to me when I travel for work.This is a great product for kids without getting them a phone you can IM with them if there is wifi and with a good pair of speakers to plug into they can listen to all their music on it.
2	1338163200	Hi I  want a full refund because I have had my ipod going on 5 months and it has been nothing but patience with it. About a month and half after I received it in the mail it just cut off for no reason and takes 15 minutes before it comes back on with it being fully charged. Now it just will not come on. Do I have warranty to get a new one or refund? I mean it has not even been a whole year and I am very over protective of my ipod to where I rather have it than my cellphone since I can call and text through wi-fi. I need something to be done asap please.-Thank You
5	1338163200	it rocked but im asking you to lower the price so you dont get bad responses but i liked it very much.
4	1337990400	I just bought this Ipod as a replacement for my 2nd gen that had a cracked screen. I would reccomend buying a case for any apple product. This is because I had my Ipod in a bag recently, when I sat down, the screen cracked around the main area of contact. I believe that the product was a very productive one, but you must get a case for it.
5	1337990400	I love this!  I have not used it for music - only for scrabble, podcasts and audiobooks.  The battery lasts 10 times longer than the old version.  This one doesn't get hot while charging like the old version, and I haven't had this one "quit" in the middle of a book like the old one did on a regular basis.  I was worried about 8 gig not being enough storage, but I have more than enough space for my use.  I also love that it can be used without earphones or an external speaker (remember, though, I haven't used it for music - only for dialog).
5	1337990400	Everything was very proffessional. Arrived on time that was predicted. All that was included was as described. Would suggest this company for people to look at.
2	1337990400	I got my iPod touch 2 months ago to replace my 2g one which had a broken screen and broken input jack.Today it fell on the ground once and broke.This is obviously my fault but that doesn't really mean the product is sturdy. My old 2g had fallen on the ground countless times and made it out with only a few dents in the back. It only took one drop for this entire screen to shatter. Like someone else pointed out, they really should make it larger and sturdier instead of buying a separate case.As for glitcheyness, I have no idea why but the "Voice command" screen keeps popping up in the most random moments. In the middle of a song, between 2 songs, etc. This ipod also freezes. A LOT. It could be the amount of music I have(600 songs)but the older 2g never did any of this. And it had over 3,000.Maybe I got a rotten apple but I'm pretty disappointed and most likely won't get an apple product in the near future.
2	1337904000	This is the 1st iPod I bought here I got the 2nd&3rd generation from the online Apple store with no prob.. The 4gen I got here freezes up when I turn the screen it gets stuck and my screen is on an angle don't know y it does that it wasn't used or refurbished( although I never had problems with my refurbished products that I buy frequently) so I'm a little/lot disappointed cus I could have bought a used 1 for less, don't need the hassle of repacking and resending not a happy camper got a refurbished Kindle Fire and had no problems.
5	1337904000	I got this item. And I was WOWED by it.if you don't like repackaged stuff. Don't get it when it sayes repackaged. Mine came repackaged and I'm fine with it. Its Really better to get repackaged. Because if its new its going to be a very very very hard. It's also a piece of cake to setup. Just put in your language and put in U.S.A. Unlease your from somewhere else. Then just put in your network then setup new iPod. It's that easy.
5	1337731200	excelente vendedor, compra realizada de forma excelente.el producto es el mismo que especifican en la venta. el vendedor resulta ser persona seria. calificado de forma positiva
5	1337644800	This product is good I refer anyone looking for a iPod touch to get this one I love it am writing this review while using my touch and am loving every moment :)
5	1337644800	I bought the I-pod Touch for my daughter for her birthday.  She loves it.  The item was exactly what I ordered, and I received fast service.
5	1337558400	Everything was exactely what they said! Quick Delivery!! My daughter loves it!! First time I have gotten something "bigger" from online, and I was very very pleased!!
5	1337558400	My daughter is using this product, and I heard no complains. It was a birthday gift for her, and she is a huge music fan. She lost her previous IPod, and the fact that she requested a similar product as replacement, clearly shows it is a quality product.
5	1337558400	This device is like carrying a small computer in your pocket. The ability to connect to wi-fi is amazing!!!! I compared my Touch to my friends Ipad. It appears that my Touch does most everything the Ipad does, but the Touch is so much smaller.
5	1337558400	this product is very slim and works extremely smoothly. Graphics are nice and has many features! its basically an iPhone without the calling capabilities. battery life is great, and after jail breaking, the functionality gets even better! if you don't have a smartphone, this is THE best mp3 player out there! web browsing, movie playing, youtube, gaming, music, FaceTime, taking pics, and everything!
5	1337472000	My 12 yr. old loves it. The games..can't get enough. The music..loud, but she's very happy. She's an high honor roll student, she deserved it. Thanks for making me "cool" this month.
1	1337472000	What they don't tell you when you buy this product is that you have no control over what your kids buy or HOW MUCH THEY SPEND.  You must provide a credit card to the i-tunes store even for free apps.  Then, any time your kids or their friends want a song, or a game or whatever i-tunes sells - they just have to click buy it.  I changed the password so they can no longer do this - but now they cannot update the apps we have already bought - and they cannot download free apps.  Without giving apple a valid credit/debit card - this product is useless, so think twice before buying this for a child or anyone that you don't also want to give unlimited access to your money.
5	1337472000	The Ipod touch is by far the best purchase I've made in a long time. Until now, I was never into the Ipod craze because my phone could hold and play songs and take pictures. The old phone can't hold a candle to the Ipod. The huge world of apps available has opened my eyes to what a hand-held device can really do. The Ipod is small and lightweight enough to carry around in the pocket without feeling like a brick, yet large enough for comfortable viewing of movies with Netflix or Crackle. The safari web browser is a REAL browser which has never failed to bring up the real websites I want instead of the 'mobile' versions my phone would call up. I originally bought the Ipod to play 'draw something' with friends because I had a blackberry-style phone with no touchscreen and fell in love with the thing. You can't go wrong with this item. Keep in mind that my version uses wi-fi for internet (some sites describe this item as '4G' which is FOURTH GENERATION, NOT 4G cellular), so you must have internet/broadband to use most of the features and to download new apps. It does plenty of cool stuff without it and you can always hit up Starbucks for a latte and to re-up on apps. Highly recommended
5	1337385600	Great product, work great have not had any problems! This is my third iPod touch.. My last was a 2nd gen and was great but this iPod is much better. Highly recommendedEDIT: ipod touch is stuck on apple logo, tried to restore. ton of errors came up. if you have a problem on your ipod and your forced to restore then be expecting AN ERROR
4	1337385600	The iPod is a great creation, and $199 is not expensive given what it can do. The iPod will be even better if it includes a better camera, Siri, and everything else that make iPhone 4S great.
5	1337299200	I love my ipod touch. it is amazing!!!!!! the 4th generation has so much variaties of things to do. It even has its own texting program. Now it is basicly an iphone. the only problem with the texting is that you have to have wifi to text. the other problem is that you can do so much with it that it is minorly confusing!P.S. it came in earlier than it said it would.i chose the free 5-8 day shipping at amazon checkout, and it came in, in 3!
1	1337212800	I bought the apple ipod touch 8GB 4th generation for my 13-year old grandson for Christmas. He loved it and was so excited to have it. Now after 5 months with his ipod he can no longer use it. It has frozen up and has the white screen of death. My best advice to anyone is to stay away from this product. It has been a true disappointment.
5	1337212800	excelente articulo, ipod 8 GB, lo recomiendo 100%,muy completo, lo recib&iacute; de cajita, totalmente nuevo.funciona de maravilla,buen precio, recomendado con los ojos cerrados
3	1337126400	the I-Pod came in good order but there was no instruction manual. This was for a 9 yeauctr old girl and purchased by her father who had no prior experience with apple products. Some limited instructions would be very helpful to access the internet options and set up accounts.
5	1337126400	I received the 4th generation ipod touch a few weeks ago and am delighted to have it.  It has all the features and specifications that Amazon stated plus some.  Glad I bought it!
3	1337126400	I have never really embraced the Apple proprietary software marketing model, and that is the reason why I have only given the iPod Touch 3 stars.Because I am not a huge fan of Apply software, for some reason I thought it would be easy to download pdfs, web pages, etc for off-line viewing directly off the iPod... I mean what the heck, the page is right there, why can't I just save it??I searched the net for solutions, and there seems to be no easy solution, there were a couple of apps I tried out, but they failed.  The Apple website talks about iTunes for downloading pdfs and files, etc... but I don't always have a PC with me.  What happens if I'm at the airport, about ready to get on the plane and I want to download a file off the web?? Well forget it without going through hoops galore.I own TWO ipod Classic 160gb, and I grudgingly learned to use iTunes for downloading, but it is still to this day, a "clunkie", process.  There is not drop and drag, and there is no saving pages directly of the iPod touch screen.  so 3 stars for the software!Now I must say, this iPod Touch is a marvel of hardware engineering, it's almost beautiful in it's design, just an impressive piece of hardware.... 5 stars for the hardware!Well, the end of the story is I wound up returning this item to Amazon (once again 5 stars to Amazon for their return policy)The reason why I returned this item is because I had bought the 32gb model, thinking I would be able to save items off the web, but as is the case, once you're not logged into the web, it pretty much shutsdown!I may still buy the 8gb machine for wifi use, we'll see!
5	1337040000	My son was constantly on my iphone playing games and asking me if I was done with it so that he could have one. I ordered him an Ipod touch for his birthday, and he's been the perfect kid ever since. I installed skype so that we could video chat while im at work, he can play minecraft with his friends and I can e-mail him. I also like the location feature. its a good buy.
5	1337040000	I have been searching for a good mp3 and I am really happy that I bought this iPod 4th generation. It helps me save time and money. Like using Skype or Facebook, I don't have to turn on my desk top and wait to start everything. I just wish though that apple will give the job to the American people rather than to Chinese. I am proud of American products.
5	1336953600	my grandson loves it so much he doesnt want to put it down and wants to take it all over the place even in the bathroom
5	1336953600	we received it on time. it is excellent, easy to use. friendly for anyone, it has a quick performance. my 8 year son is in love with it! i super reccomend this product and its seller.
5	1336953600	This product has worked flawlessly so far.  I didn't think I would use it for a lot of things but as I use it more it is addicting.Great Product and would buy from this seller again.
5	1336953600	We ordered this Ipod for my daughter for her birthday. She had a 3rd gen but wanted one that had a camera. She loved it! The service was great, the shipping was fast! Thanks!
5	1336867200	This was my first time to order an electronics product online and I'm thrilled with my iPod and how quickly it was shipped.  I have enjoyed it immensely since receiving it.  Great customer service that allowed me to track my order.
3	1336867200	the shipping service is bad, I ordered it at April 8, but it started at April 12 and it reached at April 19. it takes nearly 2 weeks to get my ipod. My friend ordered one in ebates, it only took 3 days. The product is good, except the battery, it can't navigate as long as the description. But it is ok, after all, it is a good product.
5	1336867200	I recently bought 2 Ipod Touch for my kids, and they loved them. It is the perfect gift for young kids or adults and the price is very affordable. I would reccomend it.  Try to buy the case as soon as you can, if possible in the same order.
5	1336694400	product works great, I bought it for my 15 year old son and he has had a lot of fun with it.  You can play games, connect to Facebook, take pictures, and listen to music.
4	1336694400	The IPod itself was amazing and i think the packaging kept it very safe. However the usb cord did not fit my IPod.
5	1336608000	It's easy to use, sleek and attractive design, and has many features that let me use it my way. I plan on buying another one for my fiance.
5	1336521600	I love my I pod! I use it all the time to workout or to get online. You won't be sorry when you buy this from Amazon.
5	1336435200	Always satisfied with price and delivery from Amazon and this is no different. Looked around for better buys, and couldn't find any. Very happy with product as it is a gift for my daughter. Can always get what I need at Amazon.
1	1336435200	purchased this for my grandaughter  she lives across the street  they do not have a router.  i have a router at my house  the ipod works great,  take it across the street and it will not work  apple said the ipod touch does not have a strong enough signal!!  and of course apple will do nothing to help me out.  will never purchase a apple product again.
3	1336435200	I have to say that its  good and bad that I bought this. For those who arent familar with ipod do not get this and it does not hold 2000 songs no where near it. Its a struggle synching the music, its really flimsy, and fragile.  it says its an 8gb player but it will only hold 6bs of music.  On the plus side i dont need all that music on it, i love it because of the many apps i can download alot of free apps play games i cant play on my blackberry, and i love the touch screen feature. its still taking me time to adjust to this but i think i bought a good thing. Only reason why I havent taken it back because i still think its cool. Bottom line is do your research before you buy it. You'll be glad you did.
3	1336348800	This was a good buy, even though it did not come with the IPOD plug to connect to the computer.  Plus I have to buy earplugs also to go with this product. Overall I am very happy with this product.
5	1336348800	The item that was purchase was exactly what was described in the listing. My son has enjoyed it since he got it. Amazon is the best way to shop
5	1336348800	The product arrived exactly as the vendor described it in their description. The turn around time was very quick.  I would definately use this vendor again.
5	1336348800	I highly recommend this item worked great and was exactly as described and was a great price arrived quickly, Great company!
5	1336348800	This came very quickly & was in excellent condition, just the way it was described. It had been updated with the latest version. We are extremely happy with this purchase.
5	1336262400	This was a gift for my teenage son and he absolutely loves it. The Ipod is in great condition, great price, super fast shipping. I will definitely look for this seller in the future. Thank you for giving my son a great birthday gift without breaking my wallet!
5	1336176000	For some odd reason my ipod has been having freeze issues and screen turns sideways. When I enter my password it takes at least 5 seconds for the main screen to pop up. This was not the case with my older model. Not really happy with this one at all. I bought the white one.
5	1336089600	Just got my replacement I-pod (old one was stollen!).It arrived MUCH sooner than anticipated (like 3 days).Very happy with this company, I WILL use them again.
5	1336003200	Unbelievably fast shipping!  I got it WAY before the expected ship date!  It's a gift for my husband but I opened it and got it all set up.  Looks BRAND NEW and he is going to love it.  It works perfectly.  Definitely buy from here again!
5	1336003200	Bought this for my 15yr. old son and he loves it! Using this for fun and school work. Easy to use and understand. Great apps. No problems with anything on this great product.
4	1336003200	The iPod is in great condition and works great. it had a small crack, but it isn't visible while in use. Thanks for the great product.
2	1335916800	I don't know but It did not meet my expectations. There were some scratches at the back side. Probably it was a refurbished but not really sure. I would advise to buy from apple site rather than here.
5	1335916800	I bought this product for my grandson and he has not let the iPod out of sight since receiving it.  He absolutely loves the games and music. And he loves the color.  None of his friends have a white one!
5	1335916800	Good seller, good product, good deal, is a very good product! Thanks!! In spanish: buen vendedor, buen producto, buen trato es un muy buen producto! Gracias.
5	1335830400	Apple always makes great products, bought these for my kids and they love them!  Buy from Amazon and save on product and taxes!
5	1335830400	Works as specified.  Strange quirk though - not sure if it is software or if it is actual, but the item purchased was the 4th Generation Touch yet the software states that it is 3rd Generation.
5	1335830400	I've owned my iPod Touch 8GB for almost 18 months now and it's a superb product. I use it almost everyday for reading webpages, checking my mail and playing with apps. I don't have a need to be always connected to the internet, so the Touch suits my needs fine and works out much cheaper than paying an expensive contract for an iPhone.A key thing that makes the Touch great is the "instant-on" feature. You can switch it on and within seconds you can be browsing the internet. Thus if I want to quickly check the weather or a sports score I can get the information super-quickly (certainly saves waiting a few minutes to boot up my laptop).I can say after 18 months that the Touch is very durable. There are still no scratches on the screen (although I do look after it well), and the battery life is still very good even though I use the Touch every day. I find I need to charge it about every 3-4 days.The only downside is that 8GB is far too small. Once you start downloading the very cheap/free apps from the iTunes store you'll find that space quickly fills up. Many premium games take up 500MB to 1GB of space, so even just a few of them will soon take over your Touch.  As for putting your music and video collection on the Touch as well....just forget it!  I have an iPod classic to handle these (160GB of space).Although the 8GB model is very attractively priced, I'd highly recommend paying extra and getting the 32GB or 64GB models. I'm hoping Apple will release a 128GB  version this year, although I've been hoping for this for the past two years.  I'd also like to see a bigger screen (4-4.5 inches) just to give a bit more room for reading webpages and playing apps.
5	1335830400	Great product! Enjoying how thin this is compared to older generation. Travelling makes it easier now than ever. You can connect to wifi whenever is possible. Good on playing games and checking emails.
5	1335830400	I am very happy to have purchased this item. My son has not put it down since it came. Happy as a church house mouse thnks
5	1335657600	I finally got one.  Love it, and wonder now why I waited so darn long.Amazon rocks, this is the easiest way to shop.
5	1335657600	This is the first iPod series I've ever bought.  I know for years that iPod series is good, but i did not realize it is that good. I bought this for my wife as a birthday gift and she loves it so much making me worried she is gonna be distracted a lot from her family duty.  It is easily to be addictive, to be honest, especially for children.  My 4-yr-old boy and 3-yr-old girl are constantly fighting each other for putting a hand on it.  I understand more why nowadys so many news discussing about the influence, good or bad, of Apple put on the world because literally, people don't look at people any more.  They always keep eyes on their machine screen.  People should be self-control to use the awesome technology but not ruled by it.  That all being said, this is definitely a great buy.
4	1335657600	It came really quickly and in great condition. No scratches on the screen (though there were quite a few on the back, but that was to be expected). I love it!
1	1335657600	DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE AN VERY VERY DURABLE CASE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T DROP IT ONCE OR TWICE(IN MY CASE) A WHITE MARK APPEARED IN THE CORNER OF THE SCREEN. I DROPPED MY I POD ON RUG AND NOW I HAVE A TOTALLY SHATTERED SCREEN AND WHEN I TURN ON MY I POD THE SCREEN IS WHITE EXCEPT A FRAGMENT OF THE CORNER. SO NOW MY I POD IS A WORTHLESS PIECE OF GLASS. THIS HAPPENED IN 3 MONTHS(VERY DURABLE) PAY THE EXTRA 75 DOLLARS FOR THE CLASSIC OR GET OLD,OLD I POD NANO THE SMALL THICK ONE MINE HAS LASTED ABOUT 7 YEARS AND STILL WORKS PERFECTLY(TOO BAD APPLE DOES NOT SELL THEM ANYMORE) UNLESS YOU NEVER DROP THINGS I WOULD CHOOSE A MORE DURABLE PRODUCT IT IS REALLY WORTH IT. BUT IT WAS GOOD WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY WORKING.
4	1335657600	Love it- everyone needs one. It is sleek, has a built in camera which makes it easy to post pictures to Facebook. Plenty of gigs for music.
5	1335571200	First, keep in mind I've been around computers for several decades, and I'm a Windows type of guy, and I was prejudiced against Apple.  I've had 2 iPods and wasn't overly impressed.  Indeed I bought this one so I could copy my music files to this one in addition to the one I use at my health club.  I've had it for two weeks now, and I'm truly impressed.  It processes commands (the internet, music, notes, etc.) very fast.  And the resolution is wonderful.  Today I purchased my first "app" using WiFi and the iTunes store, and it's worth the 99 cents.  The e-mail works great, as does the camera used for excellent pictures and video.  It's pretty seemless connecting with iTunes and iCloud on my computer (Windows 7).  The only sticky problem I've had is learning to "tap" commands because I've always used the keyboard mode of input.  But I figured you better get into the tap thing, because Windows 8 of course is going to be only the first use of tapping a screen for input in the Windows world.Tip for iPod newbies: while waiting for delivery, go to YouTube and watch the videos on "Apple iPod Touch Unpacking".  This will help you to hit the ground running when your new Touch arrives.One of my best buys - an unequivocal *****.
1	1335571200	even with all the software updates to fix battery life .... battery life is still horrible, now after 6 months the darn thing will no longer even charge.
5	1335571200	I hated this device. Absolutly hated it. The touch didn't let me even do anything on it. This is my comment.  :>(
5	1335571200	I upgraded my car stereo recently and I figured it was also time to upgrade how I listen to music. I figured it was time to say goodbye to CDs, and this was the perfect gadget for saying goodbye to them (I don't miss them at all). My intentions were to strictly use it for music, but I have ended up connecting it to my Wi-Fi and pretty much said goodbye to using iTunes on my computer - it's much easier just doing it all on the iPod! This thing is awesome and I really recommend. I went with the 8GB version but with about 800 songs and several apps, my space is already almost used up. So if you have tons of music like me, and still shop for more, you might want to explore some of the larger ones.No technical problems at all. Battery lasts a long time.
5	1335484800	Bought this for my daughter for a reward for her grades. Seems to be enjoying it. Works great, no flubs that I can tell. As usual Apple products delivers. Came promptly from seller with no hassle.
1	1335484800	Hi I bought an Apple iPod touch 8GB (4th Generation) - Black, for a birthday gift from my wife and it might not have the capacity to 8GB if only 6 GB. This is a steal but I will never buy anything else on this website.This is the worst purchase i've made on amazon. So beware if you buy this product has the correct capacity. Review within 30 days before it expires and may return
5	1335398400	it was delivered very quickly ,it's in perfect condition, and everything's perfect!I love it, it's perfectly in shapee.Thank you so much!
5	1335398400	For me ease of use and portability are very important. All I had to do to set up the ITouch was to hook it to my computer, pull up my Itunes account, enter my password, and Itunes did the rest. The sound quality is great too.
5	1335312000	Ideally, I wanted an iPhone. But that won't be feasible for some time, so I did the next best thing, and got the iPod Touch.First off, I decided to go with an 8GB. Not only to save the $100, but I felt that with the smaller amount of space, I would listen to more new music albums (instead of picking single songs out of a big library of tunes), and I would give more attention to the smaller amount of apps I have on it. Sounds kind of weird, I know.This thing is ultra sleek. I have my dumb phone, which is half the size of the iphone and android phones, that I use for calls, texting, and calendar/alerts. Then I have the touch for everything else. Both can fit comfortably in one small jeans pocket.The first thing you will probably notice is how nice the retina display is. You have to see it in person. Everything is extremely crisp. And you can zoom in high resolution pictures, and see fine details. Games that utilize the retina display look incredible. Games like Infinity Blade 2 look almost Xbox 360 quality.With the upgraded processor, executing tasks and opening apps are snappy. Loading web pages is brisk. Browsing the web on the iPod Touch with Safari is very impressive for a handheld device. You can view most sites in their full version, and everything looks correct and proportionate.The camera quality isn't as good as the iPhone, but it is still good enough for taking quick casual pictures for social networking and sharing with friends and family. Unfortunately, no photo flash. But I rarely found myself in situations where I needed the flash. The built in speaker does its job and has adequate volume for its size.Of course, it  continues its solid lineage as an excellent music player. The built in apps like youtube, calendar/weather/tasks are simple and effective.The best thing about the iPod Touch? The App Store. Its of course what makes the device what it is. Its what makes the iPod a handheld gaming device, a mobile recording studio, a photo editor, a research tool, communication device, and countless, countless other things.The multi-touch screen is very responsive, as well as the built in accelerometer. It has pretty good brightness as well. The built in software keyboard, while not as good as a physical keyboard, is still one of the best among the competition. I can type pretty quickly, and I don't make typos very often.Complaints? Doesn't have a radio. And like all iOS devices, does not support adobe flash. And I wish they made a 3G model, but I understand that if they did this it would cannibalize their iPhone sales.Does the iPod Touch even have any competition? Sorry Zune, you made a good effort, but we all know, Apps are king, and you couldn't bring it.Overall, its a great gadget. It does a million things, and is well worth the money. I use it daily, and its as essential as my computer and TV.
5	1335312000	The product is perfect, I had the iTouch 3rd generation and this is so much better! For me is better than the ipad because of the size.. Love it!!
3	1335312000	Bought this as a gift for my husband slightly disappointed because it came with NO pre loaded games not even your basic solitaire.  Said it could hold 2,000 song I think my husband was only able to get 1,000 or so on it before it was full.  Of the 8 GB only a little over 6 GB is avalible for use the rest is programing for the iPod.  All in all I think he likes it just was very disappoint that it does not state the correct amount of songs it can hold, 1,000 is half of 2,000 or the ACTUAL amount of space avalible for storage.
5	1335312000	The new iPod touch is definitely a major upgrade from the previous one. Faster and thinner and it has a pretty good camera. It feels good in your hand and it's super thin. The back still gets scratched easily. Just get an invisashield. Great for music and videos,ebooks, apps...etc. great for video chatting and it comes with FaceTime. The wifi is great too. Overall it's near perfect and a must-have!
5	1335225600	I love this product. Before I bought this I had 2 mp3 players. All of them had huge defects and broke right after the warranty ended. So I decided to splurge and buy this. I don't regret it one bit. Nothing bad has happened, it's works amazingly and I really like the touch screen. It's  like having a smart phone without the expensive data plan. I would highly reccomend it.
1	1335139200	It's a feature-rich tablet, no doubt.  But it's been deliberately designed to be easy to slip out of your hands and the $75-to-replace screen shatters if you glance at it wrong.  So you have to buy a case for it... which negates its sleek appearance.  Would you buy a brand new car if you then needed to also buy a roll cage for it immediately to keep it from exploding the first time someone parks too close and dings their door into you?Then you have to take it back out of the case to plug it into anything.  Into the case, out of the case, into the case, out of the case.  It gets old VERY fast.  Plus buying a case costs money,  and licensing the manufacture of a case for ipod means the case manufacturer had to pay apple for that license...  so,  you can see why they love that.The headphones that come with it are the most unpleasant, uncomfortable devices I've ever been forced to endure.  Their designers should be forced to wear them as punishment for designing them.Both cameras on this device are pretty weak by today's standards, but I guess they operate about as well as the camera on a cell phone from 2007 so it's functional I guess.Itunes for windows is easily the worst piece of software I have ever suffered through.  I'm not just saying that for drama.  There is no worse software written than itunes for windows and I have never been as infuriated while operating a computer, as I am each time I open itunes.  I understand that there are many people who like itunes very much, and I respect this difference - but feel it is equally important for them to understand that I find it intolerable beyond all prior benchmarks for misery.  Even the act of exorcising that virus from a windows machine is made infinitely more tedious than anything need be,  and is only made bearable by the feeling of relief one gets from being rid of itunes finally.So there we have it.  Yes,  the ipod touch 4th generation is an effective player of MP3's and it serves as a pocketable tablet computer running iOS,  with its manifold functionality and shiny, gruen-transfer-engaging interface.  Yes,  it has a real metal back and real glass front so the tactile sensation of touching it is deceptively solid.  Yes, for reasons which defy comprehension, this piece of junk has set the standard for every accessory speaker thing out there.It's also the most awful product I can remember purchasing because it's fragile, irritating to hold, uses a closed standard for its data connector, forces users to install a virus (itunes, yes, it IS a virus) on their computer,  and as an MP3 player it is annoying because its key feature, the touchscreen,  forces users to look at it while changing tracks or performing any other function so it's unsafe to use in the aux jack of your car stereo while driving.  I was overjoyed the day I sold this awful thing.
3	1335139200	I received my product and it was in great shape and was received in time I selected it. My only gripe is that it stted it was black however the back is silver!!!
5	1335139200	Excelente vendedor lo recomiendo 100% recibi el producto en venezuela en perfecto estado sin incidencias en la compra todo a tiempo y sin complicaciones lo recomiendo...
5	1335139200	I couldn't be more thrilled with my 8 GB iPod touch. It is an all in one everything and with 8 GB's of space, and amazing how much media you get to carry around, whether that be for apps, music, videos, books, photos, and in my case a GPS addon from Dual. Sound is pretty good through a pair of UE triple-fi Pro's, but in my opinion the iPod Classic sounds better and the volume is louder.Negatives, I'd like more battery life, but those app games really are to blame for sucking the life out of it. Fortunately cheap third party external batteries keep things going. It's a great product, has solid reliability and O.S 5 has been stable for me and it runs faster than the O.S 4.3.Highly recommended. You can't go wrong with an apple a day.
1	1335139200	Never got this item at all and the guy never resOnded to my messages he actully left amozon and tried to take my money but it didnt work
5	1335052800	I got my I-pod touch, 4, for christmas. It is, I sware, the best electronic I've ever owned. I have 104 apps and they're so fun. It's basically a mini I-pad. I just ordere a wallet case for it and it will be here for my sisters Birthday. My sister loved it so much that she ordered one for herself! She stole mine and took it to school a few times. She loves it so much. It is way better than the iPad because its the same thing but like 10xs smaller. I can carry is in my Veera Bradly or my jeans pocket. In school i keep it on my pocket in my veera and it's so slim no one knows. I love ot so much. Me and ,y friend can video call each other now because she has an apple computer with facetime so we see each ither everyday. She liuves a while away from me so this iPod helps us stay friends. THENK YOU iPOD!!!!!!!I &lt;3 THE Ipod!
4	1335052800	The product was just what was stated in the description. Would like to do business again with the seller. When selling item(s) it is important to always be honest to keep a good reputation and that is what this seller did.
5	1335052800	The iPod Touch 4th Gen 8GB is an amazing product. Apple has made many great products before but this is truly amazing. Everything works fine and I have had it for two years. Internet is awesome. Facetime is a little cheesy but works. Apps are fun. You can take pictures of what you are doing by pressing the power button and the home button at the same time. Always downloading music. iTunes is awesome. This is truly amazing.
5	1335052800	This 4th Gen 8GB iPod has performed exactly how I had anticipated plus much more.  All I needed was a vehicle to view and play music at our Church.  Now I have a mini computer to play spontaneous video on the screens, nice audio fill ins and able to text other Apple OS.
1	1334966400	I purchased ipod touch 4th to study English. (Because I'm a foreign student.) The purpose to have this mp3 player is to listen to English mp3 files. But it didn't work appropriately to transfer files from my computer to this device. And I pod touch can't arrange a lot of mp3 files and remove from device. If you want this device to play its role as a mp3 player, I don't recommend it to you. And I will not recommend this device to my friends.
2	1334966400	Okay...this one is...I don't even now how to start.NOT BLACKWON't MAKE CALLSWILL NOT PLAY DVDS!CANNOT Find ON-BOTTOM--is it hiding somewhere???TOO BIG, thought it would be more smaller!Not enough space for my lol cats and p$%^.I've owned every IPoD (except: gens 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, nano, touch, mini, shuffle, and classic) and this is teh worst!Clock keeps changing--every time I turn around it's something differnet.  Also whether app is wrong, like time.  Password is too long--AND (just like the logitech keyboard)does not have the '.  I SHOUDL NOT HAVE TO GOOGLE THE ' to text.  Says itunes is in sync, check sync--no itunes.  Doens't come with itunes--really?  That is a FAIL.  Microsoft is pathetic, they never make anything right and worst than that it's all overpriced.  I'm not Barnie Fark--I'm not MADE of money--or stage 1 prostate cancer.  WILL NEVER BUY FOR MY KIDS AGAIN.  ruins parties.PS: Bill gates has let me down for the last time.
5	1334880000	I was amazed at the features of this little wonder.  My wife is loving it and using it for her walks and for miscellaneous web activity.  It works great!
1	1334880000	my ipod wont work, my screen turned white and the apple store wont help  me ! it didnt fall or anything, it just stopped working. Now i have a white screen of death
5	1334880000	Ipod works great and was sent to me in a timely matter. I am thinking about purchasing a new another one.
5	1334793600	When i ordered the ipod, it said that it would come in good condition. When i received the ipod it was in GREAT condition. I was expecting it to have scratches on the back and screen but it only had a few scratches and the screen was in perfect condition. I love this Ipod and it did not take too long to get here. It was worth the buy and it was very affordable.
5	1334793600	Bought it for my son.  He has been using it consistantly for about a month, save the few days he was grounded.  There is so much about this iPod that is positive.  The limitless free downloads that occupy a teenager's time is perfect.  Fun, silly apps.  Easy to check internet history.  *parents, make sure you know their pass-code all the time.Would be beneficial to have internet access.  You could download the apps somewhere else and then use them later.
5	1334707200	I bought this iPod for my 10 year old granddaughter and she absolutely LOVES it!  She takes it where-ever she goes!  She can text, play music or games and she loves to Face Time me on my iPhone. It was a wonderful gift that she will be able to use for years to come!
5	1334620800	I absolutely love my ipod touch, i can do so many different things with it. I'm able to listen to my music, check my online accounts, go to social networks as well as facetime with my family members that have an ipod touch or iphone. Choosing the ipod touch was a good decision and shortly i will be looking to purchase three more for my daughters.
2	1334620800	All of my family and fiends had an iPod touch so I raced off to buy one. RIP OFF!!!!After having it for less than a week the music department froze. Only able to change the song, i can't change playlists and were stuck on one song's artwork. Very disappionted. The apps are working fine but I got this for music and that was the first thing that had a glitch.Also Facetime has terrible connection and very fuzy. NOT AT ALL WHAT THE DISCRIPTION SAID. It freezes up and won't work. Very sad because something sooooo expesive is so defective.Returning or fixing tommorw
5	1334620800	Ordered a "reconditioned" iPod 4th gen and it was better than expected.  Shipping was prompt and product came in box with all accessories without a single scratch or nick.  Very pleased with purchase and will use order another one from same seller again very soon.
4	1334534400	I an very surprised with this product. I had the exact same one before I purchased this one and it just fell apart within 1 month so I game very pleased this time around
5	1334534400	My granddaughter loves her IPod touch 8 GB 4th Generation. The only problem we had was that the first one she received was used and arrived without ear buds or a charger, even though I ordered it new.  I'm thankful that Amazon is such a great company because they quickly sent my granddaughter another one... This was the second time this had happened to me when buying an Apple product. The first time was when I bought an IPod for my daughter from Best Buy that turned out to be used. It even had porn movies on it!!  Apple needs to get it's act together because I've since discovered that other people have experienced the same problem. Apple products are great but there must be a break-down somewhere in their corporate chain at which they need to take a look.
5	1334534400	This iPod is amazing. It's like mini computer in your pocket. Just find wifi somewhere and have fun. Great for every age
3	1334448000	I didn't need this Apple iPod touch 8GB (4th Generation) - Black - Current Version.  I bought it used so I wouldn't be out a lot of money if I screwed it up.  Well, it was screwed up when I got it and luckly I had some computer experience. The passwords,emails passcodes, etc. were still on it and it didn't want to be restored the first time and it froze, but I finally got it restored and with a new driver it's downloading and running great.  I'm glad I didn't return it, because I'm enjoying audible books and my music.  I will definatley buy new when this one has seen it's last day.  I love it!!  Just buy new if you have no experience with computers.
1	1334361600	Let me begin by saying that I've taken post-graduate courses in mathematics, I've built electronic peripheral devices that interface with computers, but those undertakings were cakewalks as compare to getting a Touch-Screen iPod up and running.  Prior to the iPod, I've purchased, installed, and used generations of Apple products with satisfaction.As to the iPod itself, my wife and I often listen to audio books while traveling.  But audio CDs are limited in selection and are more often abridged than are downloads.  Downloads however require a portable playback device.  I was assured by an Apple salesperson that the newest iPod would more than meet our traveling needs.  Use was all Apple-easy.  Just connect the iPod to my Mac's USB port and my audio-book files would load "automatically" and be ready for play.Not so.As it turns out, listening to audio books on an iPod requires the downloading of an "App".  The downloading of an App requires connecting to my email at Yahoo so that my Apple password might be "verified."  Understand that the iPod is designed for people with very, very, very tiny fingers.  To enter my email address and password, I needed to correctly execute nearly twenty keystrokes.  I quickly learned the iPod is unforgiving of typing errors.  Errors are easily corrected if they are immediately noticed, but if not, error correction means beginning over.  And over and over.  Add to this the inexplicable randomness of the keypad disappearing, or of the screen leaping to one nearby, or of the in-progress entries evaporating suddenly into the ether, or of the iPod turning off with any hesitation.  (Unlike a laptop that goes into a sleep mode with a few minutes disuse, the iPod turns off, forgetting all recent activity after a dozen seconds of neglect.)  And so, after a half hour of fruitless effort I was terminally frustrated and my small-fingered wife insisted that I give her a try.  Or two tries or four or six.  But she persisted and after ten minutes she had our email address and password entered.  She triumphally tapped "next" only to realize too late that she had misspelled our last name.  Nuts.Let me say that typing a word is not as easy as "typing" might suggest.  Even on the tips of small fingers, it is quite easy to hit a key adjacent to the one aimed at.  Even with the iPod's puckish tendencies--turning off erratically, the keypad playfully disappearing--there is the fact that the letters typed only briefly appear before turning into black dots.  It's difficult to spell check a row of eight black dots.Our now-misspelled email address implied that our password could not be "verified", which meant that our access to "Apps" was blocked, which meant the iPod was unable to play audio books--the primary task that motivated our purchase.  (I tried opening a new wrongly spelled email address at Yahoo, but that fix doesn't work.)  As there was no obvious way to correct a spelling error after a "next" tap, I decided to download the iPod manual (none provided with purchase) in the hope of some guidance.  A small pamphlet in the iPod packaging provides clear instruction on how to download the complete manual.  Carefully following those instructions lead me to a site were Apple products were for sale--but with no manual download option that I could find.  I tried again with ever more care and with the same result.  The official path to the manual apparently was a ruse.  Not deterred, I did find the elusive manual by using a Google worldwide Internet search.  The effort was worth the trouble for the iPod manual was clearly written, detailed, and well illustrated.  Unfortunately however, the manual concerned itself with the iPod's functions and uses, whereas the iPod itself seemed more dedicated to screens offering products--music, film, etc.  Theory and fact were only tangentially related.  The sensible little device that existed in the manual did not seem to exist in the real world.After another half hour or more of manual-navigation frustration, I realized the spelling error correction was far beyond my skill-level.  Consequently, I phoned a local Apple-product service shop.  I confessed that I'd misspelled a word, and asked if I might hire an hour or so of profession technical expertise to right the wrong.  The shop owner admitted that such a spelling error on an iPod was no easy matter to fix, and that I might have better luck at an Apple store where the employees were "better connected" than was he.  That advice necessitated a round-trip drive of sixty miles though heavy traffic and gallons of fuel.  Momentarily I was somewhat regretful for having bought the iPod at a local retailer in a misplaced desire to support local retailers.  With more experience now, I would only buy an iPod from a dealer who could offer hands-on high-level technical assistance with small spelling errors.The Apple store gambit seemed chancy. I feared that store employees likely would be too busy selling iProducts to help much--even if one happened to have the technical skill to do so.  And too, I didn't think it reasonable to expect someone to give time to repairing a product the store didn't sell.  Instead, I decided to bite the bullet and phone Apple service at universe central.  In India?  My machine-disabling spelling error seemingly could be resolved at no lower administrative level.I phoned the Apple 800-number and waited and waited while music tinkled on.  Eventually a service representative came on--one who was quite knowledgeable, who spoke clear English and was of saintly demeanor insofar as patience is concerned.  He guided me through screen after screen, selecting this box and that until I was well lost.  We finally came to a screen where my correct email address and password needed to be entered and the task would be done.  Or so he suggested; I was by then distrustful of Apple's easy promises of ease.  So my heart sank.  I needed to type two words.  I knew by then how formidable the undertaking was that faced me.  Yet I pushed on stoically.  As before, I tried and tried and tried again while the iPod did what it could to amuse itself by turning off or dancing away to inappropriate screens.  The distant Apple representative encouraged me as best he could.  Long minutes pilled up until finally I had to admit defeat.  My nimble-finger wife then wanted a second--and third and fourth and fifty try.  She soon found herself on a screen that bore no resemblance to any we'd seen before and neither of us could find the way back.  We had been on the phone with Apple help for over a half hour and our only recourse was to start at the very start yet again--a labor of real-time hell.We apologized to and thanked the Apple-help representative, but we had failed him.  Were I at a Las Vegas slot machine, I might think that repeated random efforts would pay off eventually.  Not so on the iPod.  After three hours of hard frustrating work, our willful iPod was nowhere near operational, and we had no reasonable hope it ever would be.  Keep in mind that we were only attempting to enter an email address.  A first step.  Once that was accomplished, we had the terrifying App download to perform--a formidable exercise that likely would require more screens and screens and screens with boxes and boxes to select among, and perhaps more words to properly type until 1040 tax forms would appear simplistic by comparison.  A nightmare in that we had no nano-fingered children available.Instead we phoned a Visa representative and explained our troubles with the iPod's ease-to-use audio-book capacities.  Audio books load "automatically" we had been told, and in our innocence we had believed it.  Should it come to a dispute, the Visa representative agreed to support our request for a full refund for the disabled little wonder machine--rendered unusable and un-repairable by a single tragic keystroke and a hopeful "next" tap.
5	1334361600	The best, I've been using this for almost 3 monthsAnd all I can say is before you buy it, have a full screen protectors and a case!(;
5	1334275200	This iTouch is just what I want, white and clean. And it works great in refurbished condition. In addition, the price is fairly cheap comparing to others. I would definitely recommend it to friends!
5	1334188800	I'm so pleased with the fast delivery of my iPod.  Took less than originally quoted.  The iPod is the coolest gadget, I'm loving it.  Have over 1000 songs and the apps are the best for my use.  Thank you Amazon for making my purchase experience a positive one.Best regards.
4	1334188800	I don't know entry I waited so long to get an IPod Touch. Works great and apps don't crash. Shipping was very quick and product was exactly what I ordered.Just wish I would have spent the extra money for the model with more memory.
5	1334102400	This little machine is a beast. It's faster than my home computer. The video quality is average but the camera takes some crystal clear pics.
5	1334102400	my daughter so happy with your iPod, updated it to 5.1 and definitely great, super great beauty and simplicity is a device!!!
5	1334102400	i should have gotten a bigger one, didnt realize my music collection was as big as it is. i figured id want to simply update and pick my albums so i didnt need a big one (32gig) but now i see i want too much with me at all times and i will be buying a bigger one soon. but the device is awsome. but c'mon if ur looking at this u know its awsome. the battery life is very impressive as well
4	1334102400	It's amazing what you get with this thing.  Decent cameras (in good light) a pretty screen, and a small size.  It runs just abput everythi (certain apps seem to crash/steuggle on the Ipod Touch proessor occassionally)  A couple significant negatives-- especially with wifi on and screen fairly bright, battery life is more like a cell phone than what someone might be used to with an iPod.  After a day of moderate to heavy use, it will need to be recharged.  Turning off wifi extends battery life somewhat.  Battery life is really the biggest downside to this device, to me.  Otherwise, very happy!
5	1334016000	This item was received as described and I am 100% satisfied.  This Ipod touch is amazing and can perform a number of functions with so many applications and internet access.  It takes good quality pictures.  You can text from this Ipod and play a variety of games.Truly an amazing product.
5	1334016000	Its an excellent product, for the price, my wife use as a computer, to read email, chat, web browsing,You can also check the amazon kindle fire, its kind of diferent but is the same price...
5	1334016000	So far I am enjoying this iPod touch 8gb. Really don't have any cons since all I'm using this for music and little bits of everything. :)
5	1333929600	Service was fast and the product is great, brand new and everything I hoped it would be, I would definitely do business with them again!
5	1333929600	I got an iPod Touch in December 2011, and it has been quite a blast. The display quality is superior. Really dig the chrome backing.  The overall quality is fantastic - nothing cheap about this. Very sleek and thin.Only concern is that you can't delete synced photos directly from the device.  Also, I would recommend 32 gigabytes of internal storage as 8 is not quite enough.Chrome backing is gorgeous. iOS 5.1 is great because it includes iCloud, a remote storage server.App store has all kinds of educational apps. For example, Brainpop with a featured movie every day for free, and many other educational movies for a $2 a month fee.
5	1333929600	Very happy with it from the time it arrived. Very easy to use. arrived promptly. its just what i expected. it just didnt come with the wall piece charger.
5	1333929600	I ordered the Apple iPod touch 8GB for my grand daughter's birthday.  She loves it and keeps it constantly with her wherever she goes.
1	1333929600	Seems to work ok still figuring it out but it was ordered as new and the back of it is all scratched up
5	1333929600	Estoy complacido Con Este Producto y El Tiempo estipulado Para La Entrega muchas gracias! Bye espero volver negociar Con ustedes Gente Muy Seria
5	1333843200	I bought this Apple iPod Touch for my Wife. Received it on time and I ended up (with encourgement from my Wife) keeping it and buying her one also, from the same vendor.  Both are working great and no problems. Now we can keep up with the kids and grandkids.
5	1333843200	El sonido es muy bueno, el software es muy amistoso, la apariencia muy buena, el tama&ntilde;o muy bien tambien, 100% recomendado
3	1333843200	I am interested in the phone but I know that technology is GSM or CDMA if I'm from VENEZUELA and operators here are only GSM support
5	1333756800	I purchased this in order to talk and see my granddaughter who is 1500 miles away from us in the wintertime.  I like to be able to carry it around with me to different rooms.  Much easier than skyping, you don't need a computer.  Good purchase for my needs.
5	1333756800	great awesome cool love like !! i love my ipod very clear picture i have not found a flaw in it besides dnt let ur lil ones get a hold of it lol its just great its easy to put songs on or what ever u like :)
5	1333756800	Bought this for my wife as a gift for are one year mark only worked for a short amount of time now it doesn't charge i contacted the seller about my problem and they had no problem refunding my money maybe not a great itouch but great customer service
5	1333670400	this ipod 8g is a great, i love to listen to music and watch videos, its great for when you travel
5	1333670400	I ordered two ipod! and they arrived in perfect conditions, this ipod is the best in the market, i recommended 100%. I'm Love With it!
1	1333670400	I returned it after a few HOURS because:1. It took nearly 30 full minutes to extract white on white from the see-through case.2. Inside the case are two microscopic disclaimers, one with legalese and one with photos, neither legible because of the size.3. I managed to locate the serial number and called Apple on IP Relay.  After 48 minutes, I got someone at Apple to give first and last name and worker ID number.  She still could not instruct me how to turn it ON.4. The problem:I am deaf and disabled.  I need it ONLY FOR MOBILE IP RELAY.  The buttons are invisible.  The screen is too small.  I cannot go to an apple store.  It has to be easier to SEE and TURN ON.I am not going to use it for sound at all.It came with earbuds (never unwrapped) and another cord.  I plugged the other cord into the iPod with great difficulty (after another 30 min) because it did not fit and I did not want to force it.  Finally, I plugged that cord into the computer.  It would not fit in any USB port on the hub.  Then when I finally got it plugged in, it would not turn on.  It turned itself on and off a few times.  Leaving it alone for a few hours did not charge it.I sent it back a few minutes ago, completely disgusted with apple computer's customer service for deaf and their tiny invisible buttons and devices.I hope some day apple computer can produce a device for visually impaired that is BIGGER.
5	1333670400	The iPod Touch 4th Generation can now function as a stand alone computer, or at least what most people use their stand alone computers for, anyway........surfing, email, skype, books, music, and videos. The best surprise is the Retina Display. I can curl up anywhere and watch a movie. The picture is sharp, sharp, sharp. The image almost jumps right off the screen. Even the briefest of app research tells you that you could use the iPod Touch as the ultimate personal assistant from the time you wake up in the morning until you finally go to bed at night, all with something you can shove in your jeans pocket. The iPod Touch completely exceeds my expectations.
5	1333584000	I recently purchased a new I pod Touch from Amazon.com. I would like to say that the whole proceedure went off without a flaw.My family and I are really enjoying it.This was my first time buying from Amazon and I will buy from you again.Lookig forward to dealing with you in the future.Thanks,Dave
5	1333497600	When i opened the box i was shocked (i'm a first time user of an ipod) i was struggling to open the plastic box, i was fussing and biting it until i realized a small tape on the side. I felt like a fool when i opened it but i simply enjoy this device, free wifi anywhere, games, chatting, texting and further more. If you have not purchased one, please do so, it so worth your money and it's a hands on computer; :]
4	1333497600	You ever buy something that you know is great and has great features but you don't know how to use it to it's capacity. Well this is my feeling. I paid all this money but don't feel like I'm using all that I paid for. This is a popular item and everyone either has one or wants one.. but it's hard to use.. Where is the tutorial... I just learned how to turn it off.. The power button is along the top edge. Itunes was made for geniuses I think.. I can't always figure it out... so I just buy stuff and hope for the best.I expected that a tutorial would launch at start up.. come on APPLE .. help out the newbies. You can go to Youtube for help if you need it.. or you can call their wonderful customer service..if you start off like me...technically challenged.I got the 8 gb.. big mistake.. I like to record my kids and also they like to play games.. so I'm maxed out. I can always download stuff to my computer to gain that space again. If you are like me..get a higher capacity if you have the cash to spend.One last point.. if you are trying to decide between this and an Ipad.. I would get the ipad.. if you want a larger screen for movies, homework and surfing the internet.. The ipad is like a super sized ipod touch.
2	1333497600	The item is having a lot of scraches, the back side is having a lot even the front side, I have noticed some minor scraches.
4	1333497600	The iPod touch 4th generation was introduced on Sep 1 2010.There are a few substantial upgrades in comparison to the 2009 iPod touch detailed below.PRO:A 1ghz A4 processor - faster and more energy efficient than the 2009 model960-by-640 resolution backlit 3.5 inch LCD ("Retina") display - 4 x increase in resolution over the 2009 model's 480 by 320 pixel resolution screen.Three-axis gyroscope - useful for gaming and motion controlled applications.Dual camerasCamera 1 is a 640 x 480 resolution frontal camera for video chat (through Wi-Fi networks but limited to video chats only between iPhone 4's and the iPod touch 4th generation through the Facetime app)
5	1333497600	I purchased this for my granddaughter's 13th birthday. She loves and I do to. I have to order me one soon. The camera has some great fun settings. Picture quality can be a little grainy at times but most of the time I think it's the photographer. She can load her music on very easily.
3	1333497600	Product arrived on schedule with no damage and no instructions. Adapter took 5 minutes to place in docking port. A connector should not be this hard to lineup, push in, or pull out. Rhapsody does work on this device if you download the app. Unfortunately, any external device that controls the iPod does not recognize the Rhapsody playlist and reports that there are no songs, but if you use the device directly it will still play music to the external device. I guess when Apple says it is proprietary and if they think you don't need it, they mean it!I give it a 3 star rating because of compatability issues with its own cables, and 3rd party apps and hardware that should function flawlessly without a hitch. This was my first Apple product, but if this indicates a common theme accross all Apple products, then this will be the last Apple product I buy.
5	1333411200	I use it every day!!! For people who are thinking about buying this, the top 3 FREE apps I would recommend:1. Instagram (kinda like facebook but only pictures. )2. Temple Run (awesome game. )3. Doodle Jump (addicting game. HINT: type your name as "Ooga" and youll turn into the islander from Pocket God!!! So cute!)
4	1333411200	the ipod is great for playing apps and watching video. when ever I start playing family guy or jackass on my ipod everone is around me. the only bad things are that it lacks sometimes and it runs on a wifi connection so you dont have internet 24/7. other than that it is a great thing to have.
5	1333324800	Was sent quick anx the Ipod aas in amazing shape, its almost as if We never lost our first Ipod at all.
5	1333238400	The 4th generation iPod touch is innovative, adding both rear and front-facing cameras to the iTouch. The device is a steal at only $199 for the 8GB model. The iPod Touch is essentially a palm-sized computer, with a web browser, and not to mention the world-known app store. There are apps for almost anything. Another improvement over the 3rd generation iTouch is the retina display and the ambient light sensor, which can adjust the brightness of the screen in response to the surrounding light in the room. If you're on the fence about buying this device, you should definitely go for it, as it will provide entertainment, as well as many useful applications for a wide range of situations and purposes.
5	1333152000	I am very happy with this product (: I received it 3 days earlier than it said it would get here.  The only downside is that is is very fragil and any careless drop can ruin it if not properly protected by a case.  I was able to track it threw my computer so i knew were it was 27/7 until it got to my front porch. Right when i hear my mom calling ALEJANDRA THERE'S A PACKAGE FOR YOU!!! i already knew what it was but i was surprised that it was early. I recomend this product becasue it is fun and awesome!
5	1333065600	I am just addicted to this thing! It is amazing the amount of things that you can do with it. Play your favorite songs, movies, videos, etc. You still have internet access wich is amazing; youtube, websites... all in the palm of your hands!
5	1333065600	Love the new Itouch. Love the new camera and the speed of the internet seems to be faster. Much clearer screen than older Itouch models. The videos are a nice touch as well. Nothing cooler than facetime with someone. Very pleased with this model so far and would highly recommend.
4	1333065600	I've lived with my iPod 4 for a year.  It is so much better than my 3 gen Nano and  my nano touch doesnt even show on the radar.  As an MP3 player it's pretty good.  not bulky and interface is great.  I also really dig the Genious lists.But what I really love is that it keeps me from sitting at my computer... heck, it IS a computer, at least in the sense that I can web surf and deal with email... over wifi and it's free as long as I can get a signal.  Sometimes a challenge but it's pretty cool to leave my smartphone 3g friends fumbling when we're trying to bird-dog trivia.  However this power comes with a price... Serious web browsing will deplete the battery fairly quickly. But playing from the music libray doesnt seem to pull much of a drain and neither does streaming music... which brings me to my first problem with this Pod...  Why didn't Apple include a RADIO TUNER???  My Touch Nano has one but it's battery life is THE WORST.  So, for this I think Apple is guilty of holding out to require a demand for the Touch Nano.... Which is a really good device if you just need something to stay alive for 4-5 hours.And why wouldn't Apple include a charger for something that costs close to $300?And as many have already pointed out; the camera isn't very good, and not nearly as good as the iPhones.  it's ok for candid snaps but leaves me jeleous after watching what my friend can do with his iPhone and cool imaging software.And these few drawbacks are why my electronic buddy gets only 4 of 5 stars. But I still take it almost everywhere because I never know when I'm going to learn how to do something new with it.Also spend some money on a good protector. It's not very sturdy and I've seen what mild neglect can do. Mine has escaped damage thanks to my Otterbox Commuter case.  I only take it off for occasional cleanings. I've dropped it several times and pocket it a lot but it's still in really good condition.
5	1332979200	Oh my goodness, I ordered two other products with the new Ipod.  We thought it might be a couple weeks before we received the product but it was like three or four days.  The I pod came brand new in the box with headphones, even a clear plastic case to place in when not in use.  We love it. IT is working great so far so good!
5	1332979200	Excellent service and fast, there was no problem at all, I recommend this product--Excellent service and fast, there was no problem at all, I recommend this product
2	1332979200	Apple is known for their ease of use and customer focused product.  That's why I am really dissapointed with this product.  Recently this product was stolen.  After having the device stolen, I learned that there is an application that can track its whereabouts if stolen, but only if you had previously downloaded and activated it.  Really?  Like without prompting I am going to go fishing for an application I don't know exists?  What was Apple thinking?If privacy was the concern, then during the initial setup I could have been given the option to turn it on or off.  The only explanation I can think of is that Apple could not pass up the money they make from selling the app.  As if they don't make enough.  That's just greed.So, with my device stolen, I have no intention of replacing it (too expensive) and I am no hurry to buy anything more from Apple (just another greedy corporation who has lost their way).  If you think I am wrong, remember the iPhone design problem where if you placed your finger on the outer edge (lower left) you would lose reception?  The solution was a cheap, plastic, made in china bumper.  Remember Apple's reaction?  I'll remind you... corporate sent out an email telling all reps that in no way would Apple provide a free bumper to customers to ease their pain.  Never mind that those customers paid a premium to get the phone and never mind that the bumpers probably cost $0.30 to make.  Corporate greed... pure and simple.
2	1332979200	I bought an 8Gig iPod touch.  It came in the mail, I hooked it up to my iTunes, and iTunes is telling my iPod has a maximum capacity of 6.4Gigs!?!?!
5	1332892800	The Bad: Power button is in a bad spot, screen could have been a little bigger, camera quality is not the greatest in low lightDidn't the 3G touch just come out last year? It did, but this new iPod reflects the next-generation hardware of the iPhone 4. With the Retina Display (more on that later) and a new 1GHz processor it trumps the 3G in every way. With the additions of two cameras and a mic this brings the iPod to a whole new level for Apple.The new model is actually a bit smaller than the 3G, but just slightly lighter despite having more parts inside. There is one camera in the front at the top and once in the back. The touch screen also feels smoother and sleeker and seems a bit more responsive. Also, thanks to the iOS 4 you can now multi task, so pulling up a walkthrough for your game in Safari won't require you to completely shut down your game so this alleviates having to save constantly. You can also just hit the home button, pull up your music, watch a video, or even jump into Facetime then go back into another app. Multi tasking has come quite a bit late for Apple, but at least they're catching on.Under the hood the device has the same GPU as the 3G, but the processor is a whopping 1GHz which is unseen in a phone let alone an MP3 player. If you just listen to music you won't care, but this is what allows you to multi task and swap between apps without much slow down. It makes surfing Safari faster and game loads are quicker. It also shares the same amount of RAM which is a huge 256 MB. The resolution has also been doubled at 960480, but is still lower than most high end phone models, but for an MP3 player this is amazing. It allows for 720p video, so HD video watching has finally come to your iPod. The Retina Display is actually how the screen displays it's graphics to you. Apple's research showed that 300 ppi is the max amount the retina in the eye can see from about 12 inches away, and bumping the resolution up any higher wouldn't make a difference to your retina.The camera is pretty decent, but you have to have a lot of light or you will get grainy pictures. The video looks great though, so this perfect for people who don't have high quality phones or cameras. Despite these features the iPod can also play next generation iPhone games that have higher texture resolutions, better lighting, and just overall look really close to current generation consoles.There aren't too many complaints about the device except the power button. It used to be nestled right on top of the edge of the device on the left side, so it was just an index finger away. Now it's on the right side and nestled on the curve so it's a pain to get to and you have to kind of contort your hand to get to it. Was it because the camera is on the other side? Probably, but this was a poor design choice. Overall the 4G is an amazing device, and adds a ton of new options to make it well worth a new purchase.
5	1332892800	Im so happy my ipod came in the mail :D i practically hugged the ups guy!!!!!! anyways its a must have!!!!!! best eletronic i own!! ;D
5	1332892800	I finally bit the bullet and bought an ipod touch!!!!! Boy am I glad I did. I can now store all my music on my ipod and free up some space on my android phone. Sound quality is also better on my ipod than my android. The only thing I didn't like was the earphones that came with it. I hate those type of earphones because they don't fit or stay in my ear. But that's easily solved, just buy another set of earphones(preferably the ones that go in your ear).
5	1332806400	I love the price and service that was provided by Amazon.  I needed a new ipod 4 Gen White for my daughter I did not have to think twice about where I would purchase from.  I found exactly what I wanted at a great price.  Would buy again.
5	1332806400	Best iPod ever! If you are planning on buying an mp3 I totally recomend buying this!! The price is worth it. In my opinion, there is no other choice that can top this.
5	1332720000	It's come a long way since the Commodore 64 I had when I was a kid.  One generation, and this is what we can do.  Amazing.  Great Apple product.  The screen in amazing.  Wifi is easy to use and I enjoy all the apps.  The wifi eats into battery life.  But if you turn wifi off, the battery lasts really good.  Great selection of apps.  My first, but definitely not my last Apple product!
1	1332720000	I'm not happy because the product is not the publicity is not double camera and it is the 4th generation is not a scam?
1	1332720000	This is the fourth mp3 player I've owned and by far the worse. This thing requires DRM software that is terribly burdensome and frustrating. I regret getting an Ipod touch and will never get another apple product again.
4	1332633600	I did buy my ipod without thinking that would be one of the best purchases I made ''and I am very surprised by the product is fantastic, it's like having a mini computer pocket ME, but the only disappointment is that it includes a charger wall in the product. The product shipping was fast and agile, without any problem.
5	1332547200	Wow...what I have been missing...received my ipod on 3/23 and it is the greatest thing since water...lol...everyone been telling me I need to get one...I really love my ipod...
5	1332460800	I bought this for my son for his bday and he loves it. I'm not too impressed with the itunes having almost full control of the device. I can say if your not very tech savy this may be a bigger pain than you think.
5	1332374400	The iPod touch totally rocks it's marvelous it can do everything I like it a lot because it has mail safari YouTube games and lot's of other fun things.
4	1332288000	Product was very well kept, minimal scratches and came with a fresh install of iOS5, there were faint scratched on the back, but I expected that, I don't really care though, its a wonderful upgrade from my 2nd gen ipod touch!
5	1332288000	I love my iPodTouch 4G! / &iexcl;Amo mi iPod Touch 4G!I recommended! / &iexcl;Lo recomiendo!********************
4	1332288000	This is an amazing product.  The only problem I have had with it so far is that my screen turned white after a couple of weeks.  After turning it off, it worked fine when it came back on after 10 minutes.  That is the only problem.  Other than that, it is amazing.
5	1332288000	This was a birthday gift for my daughter and she loved it.  Nice color on the ipod and wasnt to hard to get started.
5	1332288000	I Love how easy it is to load music and listen to it later. The touch screen is very easy to use but the typing takes alot of practice when you have big fingers!!!!
5	1332201600	i love the ipod touch 4g. i already had one but i lost it, and i bought another. the ipod touch is just like the iphone 4g but without the cellphone part, so if you already have a phone but want the ipod it is perfect.
4	1332201600	I like this product it is amazing to go on and I have fun using it when I'm bored and wen I want to listen to music this helps me out when I'm relax
5	1332115200	It takes a pair of days in order to initiate the request, but complied with the order and the product arrived in perfect condition. many thanks.
5	1332115200	This is the second IPOD Touch I've purchased from Amazon and I must say....great purchase!  Both were packaged well and we have had NO issues at all with either IPOD!
5	1332115200	This is a great product. Just got one for my 12 year old and he loves it! You can go on skype and a bunch of other apps! This is a great transportataion system too.
1	1332028800	This thing sucks no gps no radio low camera i recomend getting the Samsung galaxy player 4.0 way better has gps radio and lots of more features plus sd card hole
5	1332028800	I own an Ipod nano 4g so I didn't really purchase this for music. It was bought for everything else. I mainly use it at work for having mobile access to Auto Cad drawings, but its a killer gaming platform. When you have a few minutes to spare / kill, a few rounds of Tap Tap or Angry Birds is a sure good way to pass time. On a whole, the device feels comfortable in hand, even with a protective case. I've owned it for about 6mths now and have never once used it without the case. The feel of it feels heavenly without it, so I remove the case ever so often just to get a touch...lol. I would recommend buying one of those bundle accessory packs that gives you a screen protector, case, car / wall charger etc, so you won't be bogged down to charging it via a laptop / computer. If you ever considered getting an Iphone, just for apps sake... this is just a good!!!! It's an Iphone without being able to make calls. Unless you have a wifi network around and skype!!. Then its just as good. The still camera isn't the best, but its good enough for me when I need to take quick shots of stuff in the field. All in all, I'm glad I purchased it, and its definitely worth the price. Depending on whatever you intend to use it for, work, entertainment, play.. there is definitely an app for that!!
5	1332028800	I got this for christmas and its great!It holds a lot and its very small.The only problem i had with it was that it only had 6.8 gb. when i got it. There is not a problem i have with it those idiots who gave it one star don't now what there talking about.Buy this now!Go jesus!
5	1332028800	One of the best devices ever. I do everything on my iPod touch. Great  gadget. It' very easy to use. I love this product
1	1332028800	Ipad delivered in one day. however it did not come with a charger. Really? I would love to say how great it is but I cannot charge it.
5	1331942400	Very nice product. It was for my son and he loves it. It's got cool design and small enough for him (9 year old) to carry around.
5	1331856000	I got this so I could play games when my husband has his iPad with him at work.  It is so much fun and easy to use, both my little ones enjoy playing games on it too!
5	1331856000	EXCELENTE EQUIPO, LLEGO RAPID&Iacute;SIMO Y SIN CONTRATIEMPOS, EN PERFECTAS CONDICIONES...MARAVILLOSO EQUIPO TENGO TRES MESES CON EL Y FUNCIONA DE MARAVILLA... RECOMENDADO...
1	1331856000	I really liked the way this tablet looked but that's where it ends.  I had high hopes after searching for days trying to find a table in the price range I wanted with the features I wanted.  The tablet is not user friendly and is clearly a "China" tablet.  If your looking here, keep looking.  This is not worth the time.
5	1331769600	I bought this as a christmas gift for my oldest son. WOW!! I didn't know mommy was going to hit the jackpot. He loves it, did I say he loves it.  He doesn't even use his cell phone anymore. This was a great purchase. Not only does he love it, it saved me $40 a month on his cell phone bill because all his friends have I-something. IPhone, IPad, IPod, what's next?
5	1331769600	I received this one day earlier than the listed dates.  I am very happy with the iPod.  It is very easy to use and set up.  I was very pleased with the apps that were loaded on it and it is so easy to get the apps that I wanted.  The main reason I wanted it was to read my Bible.  I loaded YouVersion and at 68 years old I find it easy to use and read.
5	1331769600	Product as expected, and it arrived on time. It is an awesome product and exceeded my expectations. The service was excellent.
5	1331769600	Product arrived as promised in good, working order.  Very satisfied!  Used as a gift and the recipient very happy with it.
5	1331769600	I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it.  I bought the same one for my son's birthday. He loves his too.
5	1331769600	What can I say about an Apple product that hasn't been said already? I bought this for my grandson for Christmas, and he loves it!
5	1331769600	Watch movies, videos, read books, listen to music.  Can't ask for much more.  Love all of the apple products
5	1331769600	The device is working as expected and came in a great condition...Thought it may have came with a AC adapter but it was okay...had a bunch lying around.Great Seller!
5	1331683200	this was a Christmas present for my 10 year old son.  I shopped the prices and this was by far the best.  We have not had any problems with the device and he loves it. I was a little concerned about getting the 8GB but it has been more than adequate for his use, which is down loading apps, games and music.
5	1331683200	We got this 8 GB for our 11-year-old; it meets his needs and he is thrilled with it.  But we had to go to 32 GB for our 15-year-old, as older teens become power users pretty quickly.  (The 8 GB is probably fine again after the age of 35-40, I'd bet.)One more note if you are indeed buying for a kid:  While there are free apps available at the online Apple Store, you can't get them without opening an account, and you can't do that without a gift card or providing your credit card information (used to be able to do so, but that option no longer exists).  Go with the gift card ($15 minimum) to protect yourself & your credit line!
1	1331596800	I got it. Asked the the seller that some thing is messing this up. Keeps crashing. No replies. Waste of money and time on this. I mean I really need it this you know.
5	1331510400	Hello, I bought this for my ipod 4g white girlfriend, and she liked it very much! the ipod is just great, I recommend everyone buy without fear.
4	1331510400	this was a great deal i bought this item as a Christmas gift for my grandson he use it everyday
5	1331510400	it gets old after awhile so thats bad but who cares it is awesome. It is my first apple product and is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! again
4	1331510400	I absolutely still loving this but it's getting slower and sometimes it freezes too, I think it's because of the applications that i have so sometimes i don't have a choice but to delete some of my apps.
4	1331510400	This was the best gift my 2 kids could have ever gotten I think!  It is silly that Apple even makes an 8gb because it does fill up quickly, but it suits it's purpose for my 6 and 7 year olds and has been loads of fun.  The 8gb was just in our price range.
5	1331510400	I love my Ipod. There are so many apps and accessories available at many different stores. I can surf the web at any time as long as I have a connection. It has operated well with no problems.
5	1331424000	It's awesome, it shipped quickly. I like how slim it is and how pretty it is. lol there's plenty of free apps and iMessage, which lets you text anyone anywhere for free using WiFi. I like it very much, and recommend it to anyone looking for a new ipod.
1	1331424000	Bought two latest model iPod touch for my niece (ipod touch 8GB) and for nephew (ipod touch 32GB). The 8GB one had the backlight gone bad within less than 2 months of use and I had to get it replaced from Apple store. My nephew just started using his ipod from mid-January and I just heard from my him that the 32GB one is also gone bad and it doesn't charge anymore... I have yet to get it checked....I am extremely unsatified with my iPod purchases on Amanzon :(
5	1331424000	great ipod with wonderful access. it wasn't quite 8 gigs that i expected but still good nonetheless. have hundresds of songs to enjoy now.
5	1331424000	I received My iPod Touch(As a early birthday gift) I absolutely LOVE IT!! Who needs an Iphone/Android when the Touch can Do basically anything a cell phone can do only without the Cell phone contract. Since I have constant wifi I can pretty much do as I please with my touch. I have over 500 songs downloaded for my listening pleasure as well as games I can play when I'm not on wifi. Facetime Is AWESOME, I can Chat with my Sweetheart who's over 1200 miles away from me at the moment but Facetime makes it soo much easier to deal with the distance between us; not counting all the apps I can download such as Oovo/Skype/Pinger..Imessage is another great thing because we're now constantly connected . KUDOS for APPLE for making their products so user friendly..For the PRICE it was a STEAL! Again LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!
5	1331424000	This is a great I pod lots of fun the apps are unlimited! It is easy to connect to the web, I mean easy. simple to learn just start playing with it.However I would strongly cation on choosing super saving shipping Amazon held for days before shipping.
5	1331424000	I'm more than happy with my iPod and loving the iCloud that allows me to have all my music on it in a very easy way. If you don't need an iPhone, get an iPod touch.
5	1331424000	I really like my new ipod touch. I use it everyday! I couldn't live without my music and this ipod is perfect!
4	1331424000	This was a good buy. The price is right and the product never stops surprising you.Definitely a good investment.Friends already want me to order for them.
2	1331424000	The product itself and the service were great... But it was listed as "newly installed LCD screen" which is perfectly fine...but it was poorly installed. The screen jutted out a bit, and it wasn't a flat screen. So, little to say, it cracked within a week. The price for the screen could've been used to just buy a new iPod touch. So I recommend that instead...
5	1331251200	Great iPod. i got this because i got 200 bucks for Christmas and this is what i wanted. plus i have more gb now still use my old nano 4gb for going to school lol. great ipod though! can't go wrong with apple products.
5	1331164800	Good quality, fast shipping, I recommend this to others!I been looking for an ipod and this is definitely a great one.Thank You!
5	1331164800	This is they best item i have every gotten on amazon. This ipod does EVERYTHING!!!!! Its very fast on the internet and apps are amazing and have a hudge store. IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT GETTING THIS DONT THINK JUST BUY IT!!!!!!!
5	1331164800	We have two of these in our house.  What can I say... between me, my husband, and my kids, the iPod's are well loved.  We're not big Apple lovers.  My tablet is actually a Samsung Galaxy Tab, so just saying... The only thing I have to say against the iPod is that it's Apple, but we forgive it.  It's easy and convenient to have - I forget I only have wifi on it though and try to access the internet from it like I do on my tablet using the 3G.  :)  Oh... oops.  It's not hubby's iPhone.
2	1331078400	I ordered the iPod it's nice but it's not 8gs it's only 6 I would have returned it but my son would be sad and think I was punishing him. But I will call the manufacturing company and inform them because that's like fraud! Please check before downloading apps or giving it to someone as a gift.
3	1331078400	I bought this for my daughter for Christmas,she was so excited when she realized what is was and she has not put it down since,it is every bit of a five star rating product but I gave it a three star rating because the battery life on the touch sucks and I was very disappointed about that. My daughter is happy with it and that's all that really matters.
4	1330992000	i bought the Apple IPod touch 4 about a month ago for my Fiance cause she has been raving that she needs a new one cause the 2nd Gen was pretty much worn out it will freeze up a lot and lot of the times the volume button wasn't working right so iended up buying her a new one for a gift and not once has she put it down she been getting apps after apps and not only that ithas great sound she don't even need her headphones to listen to music or to watch movies cause the old one didn't havevery good sound at all but the only down side i really have is this IPod Touch 4 gen is that it's a lot thinner so she getsworried it might break on her one day and the other down side that the battery life isn't as good she has to charge itup a lot but other then that it takes really good pictures and captures great video and audio so overall this IPod Touch4 Gen is amazing and she loves it and also i have notice to that u can put pictures on the home screen and lock screenwith her old one u couldn't do that it would be all black and boring but this new IPod Touch u can do that :)
5	1330992000	I will make his review short and sweet for the people like me who don't have time to read a long review.This device is great! A huge upgrade from the 3rd generation. First not one but two cameras. With the new thin design its a miracle they got a camera in the ipod let alone two! Many people have been complaining about the low res cameras but should be grateful that there are 2 cameras.Overall this device is amazing great apps and now comes with the facetime app so you can chat with other owners of this ipod or friends with and iphone!
1	1330992000	i never received this product. ordered it on feb 3rd waited until feb 17th. found it was "lost in the Mail" second i pod ordered was due to come in on feb 25th didnt get that i pod either. Finally canceled my order. Didnt get any kind of "sorry for the inconvience what can we do to make it up for you" from amazon only "lets try again and you can wait another 5 to 10 days for your son's birthday present that was now already a month overdue"- try explaining that to a 10 yr old. Finally just canceled my order- guess i'll try Walmart. I do realize it was not actually Amazons fault as much as the FEDEX shipping center, however Amazon didnt really do anything to make it right except to wait.
5	1330905600	Simple purchasing options, ease in navigating site. Great products= happy customer!I have and I will continue to purchase products from amazon now and in the future.
5	1330905600	My daughter loves her gift, and the price was remarkably reasonable. I would recommend anyone who is looking to save a few buck, to shop at amazon.com.
5	1330905600	The price was unbeatable!! I love the set up and all the new features!!!  The shipping was fast! I will be buying more products from buyer if they continue to have great deals!
5	1330819200	The ipod touch works great.  No problems so far.  My daughter loves it and uses it all the time.  She is able to text or email on it.  She loves to play the games online.
5	1330819200	I loooove it!!! I do everything on this thing. I am actually writing this review on it. Besides my only reason for buying this for the  music. I have downloaded everything from kindle(which I hardly use the kindle touch anymore because of this) to movies, games, and even docs that I find and send to my email. The size is perfect being that I can just put this mini computer in my pocket. Even if you have no knowledge of technology (like myself) this is fool proof stuff. I don' t know about all the generations iPods or pads but this is simple. Con: I really should have invested in one that can store more music. So for anyone reading this review can I get an answer to having more storage without buying another? Is that possible?
5	1330732800	Present for our 13 year old daughter.  She's thrilled and uses it everyday.  Way cool little gadget.  Tons of free Aps. Cloud. And as a bonus it even plays music.
5	1330732800	This product is amazing, the only reason it does not have the capabilities of the iphone is because it does not have wifi AND a 4g network to go along with it.  When you download something or use internet while using the iphone it uses both wifi and 4g just not as much 4g to save on your data plan.  If you were really planning on having a legit camera on the thing then you're mistaken because of how small it is do not expect to be able to take perfect pictures to print out, just buy a good camera for $200 and stop complaining.  The screen shatters easily because people make careless mistakes such as dropping it, the screen doesn't break unless you drop it on the screen part which in that case even most glass screen phones break like that too so take the time to invest in a case preferably one of the exploding ones so that the ipod lands easily on the ground instead of full out blasting the case and ipod.  For the size of the product it is actually decently fast and has great capabilities to go along with it.  Only thing wrong with this product is when you do break the screen the service to replace the screen is a hassle and in the case sometimes it is worth it to just pay for a new used ipod all together for a little more money.  Set your expectations low and be happy for the amazing technology now days, I broke my screen and brought it to a local shop and they ended up not being able to fix it so I just bought a new used one from Amazon for $40 more than what it would be to fix the screen and it's been driving me crazy not having my ipod for 3 weeks now.
5	1330732800	I got it shipped to me fast and it was in excellent condition. They even inclose a card saying they want you completely satisfied with your product and to contact the if not, something small but very much appriciated!
1	1330732800	LATELY I BOUGHT THE 8 GBT IPOD TOCUH, IT IS HORRIBLE IT ACTUALLY COMES WITH 6 GTS DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!
1	1330646400	Apple's "Business" is apparently to look the other way while its unscrupulous app developers rack up bogus in-app charges on children's games. Apple then takes a 30% cut of all of these bogus charges, giving it little incentive to rein in the practice. The default settings of the iPod allow children to make unlimited in-app purchases with no approval as long as the apple ID was entered within the last 15 minutes. In many of these cases the child is not even made aware that he is doing something that will incur a charge.
4	1330646400	This thing works great but would be perfect if it was just a half inch wider. I know it is supposed to be pocket size, but my pockets aren't that small. The rounded back makes it harder to hold on to also. Square it up!
5	1330646400	My 10 year old got this for X-mas and absolutely loves it!!!  It is easy to use and awesome to have the latest information at your fingertips.
4	1330560000	Works great.  Shipping was great.  It's user friendly.  Next time it would be nice to have more clarification as to what is included...like...earbuds...cable, but no charger. Thanx
5	1330560000	I'm very pleased with my Apple IPOD touch 8gb. It's everything it says it is. I don't know what i ever did without it. I highly recommend it to my friends.
5	1330560000	I got the 8gb from my spouse for Christmas, and I use it almost constantly....playing games, using the wonderful reference material apps, listening to podcasts, music of course, surfing the web, you name it. I already carry a blackberry for my job, and have a regular personal cell, so I wasn't looking for a smart phone or the monthly cost...the ipod does everything I could possibly have wanted from a smart phone, except for making phone calls or being able to get on the internet when wireless isn't available.  Those are the ONLY cons to this device, and I would recommend an ipod touch to anyone. It's lightweight and basically just a lot of fun to use. My only problem is keeping it out of my busy 6-year old's hands...he is an Angry Birds addict now!
5	1330560000	Honestly the product speaks for itself but I will say I didn't know the fourth gen had FaceTime which is pretty much amazing for me.  I have family all over the country so its definitely worth it.  Also since Apple products are very compatible I can answer the FaceTime call on my macbook pro or the iPod.  I don't spend to much time outside of wifi range, especially with the expansion of wifi networks pretty much everywhere. So not having 3g is fine...I have a go phone so the cheapness offsets the hassle of two devices...I pretty much have a backpack most places I go so that isn't bad either...anyway GREAT product!!
5	1330560000	This is my first iTouch and I am very happy with it. I am amazed at what it can do and we are kind of inseperatable now as I use for work and relaxtion all the time. I strongly suggest you read the manual as I found myself being constantly amazed at all the things it could do.
5	1330473600	I have had my ipod touch for about 1 year now it hasnt had any noticeable problems yet.I am very pleased with it,i think it was definitely worth the money.I have used it for texting calling and my favorite facetime.I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5	1330473600	Use this every day for music, weather, 'quick' news and E~mail.  'Clock' is soreliable I use it every morning as an alarm and yoga exercise timer.  Quite loud !The real sleeper APP is Adobe Overdrive to read digital library books.  Free.  Log on to yourlocal library and search for an available digital title.  Download.  Adjust the font sizeand at night use reverse (night) video to minimize light.  7/14/21 day checkout time.PS: Automatically returns book when time expires!  Fun tostream Netflix.  Many APPs are happier on the iPad's larger screen; but for sheer conveniencethe Touch has no equal (except iPhone).  Own 1st generation ~ and can'timagine this with a camera !  Can't imagine this 10 years from now !!!And ... 'Pandora' mixes are such a pleasure withearbuds or ported into the home stereoand especially over the car's sound system !
5	1330387200	Hola! mi novio tiene una semana usando el producto y hasta ahora le ha funcionado de maravilla. as&iacute; que lo recomendamos!!
5	1330387200	I bought this for my stepdaughter, we had already bought one for our oldest daughter brand new.  But, when I seen the price of this one, I decided to give it a try and it looks great.  There are a few scratches on the back of it but the front is perfect; I'm glad I got it, she loves it!!
4	1330387200	Have had it for a few days now. No problems with it so far. Only downside is camera is very low MegaPixels. However, it lightweight and is much better than my 3rd genration ipod. I also wish it came with a wall charger adapter for the USB charging cable.Pros:fasthigh quality screenCons:low MP for the camera
5	1330300800	I love this ipod. price was right, it;s in perfect condition. i would recommend to anyone looking for cheaper ipod.
5	1330300800	I bought this a while ago and I enjoy it very much. I can play many games and text my friends. I can also call people. If you are thinking about buying one but aren't quite sure, I really think you should, it is like a computer that can fit into your pocket. Eight gigabytes is a perfect amount, not too small, not too big.
5	1330214400	Very nice interface and resembles more like a an Iphone.  When connected to WIFI, I feel like I have another Iphone with me.
5	1330214400	honestly i lost my last ipod, but this ipod i got was vitually out of the box new. the screen was in prestine condition and there were no noticable scratches on the back at all. im very happy with this purchase. shippin was nice and quick. thanx a bunch
5	1330214400	So I thought about ordering the new white ipodtouch. It was great because it came the next day after I ordered it. It came in great packaging. Perfect condition. I was very exited to see this. I could not find it anywhere in the stores. But good old amazon had it. Overall great iPod I love it.
4	1330214400	ok, i never got into all the hype about apple products, i thought, you buy the machine and then it just keeps costing you money,boy was i wrong-i bought a 64 ipod from a private person here on amazon, it is like carrying around a little computer. the one thing i was not about to do is spend a fortune on music, so, i looked into other things and i found out the best way is get rhapsody, one device 10.00/a month- 3 devices 15.  it is amazing, my son searches for music, and then , my ipod is not even hooked up to the computer and it transfer your playlist, its way cool, we have over 4000 songs. my son was totally jealous of mine so i got him an 8 gb ipod, facetime,skype,netflix, my newspapers,my mail, and yes even angry birds. i really do not know how we ever not had them, the reason i gave 4 stars is the only downside is the home button, kinda weak,if that messes up you are in trouble, i thought they could come up with a touchscreen home button. i do suggest getting a pen,for them, it makes it way easier to use the keyboard and functions. get a good one, targus,stylus-it will say for ipads and tablets,it will cost about 12 dollars.well worth it.
5	1330128000	muy buena compra, excelente servicio, recomendado a cualquier comprador que desee llevar un buen producto, ademas de ser totalmente seguro.
5	1330128000	Shipping was fast and item was easy to install and set up. I was very impressed with the way it looked. It met and exceeded my expectations.
2	1330128000	This was a Christmas present for my daughter, and in typical Apple fashion, they can't make a product built to withstand heavy duty wear and tear. While it does some cool things and provides lots of entertainment for my daughter (she loves it) I was disappointed it. The screen is easily cracked, so you HAVE to purchase additional 3rd party items to prevent this from happening. And within a month, it had completely crashed forcing me into the dreaded hours long phone call (literally) with Apple...that fortunately I didn't have to pay for since it was still new enough to qualify for free help. I am just not a fan of Apple, hate the frustrating piece of work that iTunes is, and would rather not have spent my money on that particular prodcut. But since it was a Christmas present, what can I do?
5	1330128000	Item provides continuous engaging for young impressionable personas. Gains access to almost anything virtual. My child never puts it down (only for recharging) so I can only translate his activity with the apparatus as "he loves it".
2	1330128000	I bought this IPOD for my Granddaughter.  Very shortly after she got it the screen shattered on it.  To be honest it did get dropped but not very hard.  I looked on some forums and this seems to be a common problem with the new generation of IPODs.  In fact a number of people had taken them to the Apple store and had them replaced at no cost, no questions asked.  Unfortunately we don't live near an apple store so this is not an option.  The IPOD still works and the touch screen also.  You just have to be careful not to get glass slivers in your finger.  If you purchase one of these be extra careful with it as you may have one that easily shatters.
4	1330041600	This iPod works extremely well except for the fact that safari and sometimes iTunes crashes when I listen to music also. It (safari) sometimes crashes when I am not. I don't know what that's about but it needs to be fixed a.s.a.p!!!!
4	1330041600	Trying to configure a new Ipod is a formidable experience.There are no set up instructions with the unit and there are a lot of questions to be answered before you can finally use this thing. If you don't write down this stuff it's hopeless. I tried to verify my logon a few times and it just keeps me going in circles. Now I have an appointment with an Apple tech to call back.
5	1330041600	Ipod was very well packed and shipped. Product came two weeks before schedule. I was very satisfied i would highly recomend KYGABYTES.
2	1330041600	-This divice has much more potential. Especialy the screen is very impressive and it is easily the strongest side of the ipod.-Cameras performance is poor, but video is nice. Software is less than ok. Very few of the apps are decent.-Whoever design the volume and power buttons should go back to the basics and try to design something that is at least usefull and easy to use, not both ugly and impractical.-The battery life is a joke.-Soooo easy to scratch.I also use a cell phone with Adroid system on it. Easily better than the one on ipod.Just like any other item or brand that was ever desired by people, it is not the best, or even very good. But it is not important, as long as people will think that it is cool to own one, apple does not have worry about sales figures.A very good example of successful marketing.
5	1329955200	What an excellent product. I didn't think it would be this good. What is "good?" It is versatile, holds a good amount of information, and the interface is slick. Itunes can be finicky, however.
4	1329955200	I would give my iPod touch 4th generation 4 stars. Because it has notes, music, videos, and you can play games. My iPod holds lots of different music albums and games.  The bad thing is it has a short battery life. That is why I only give my iPod 4 stars.
5	1329868800	I should of bought one sooner i love it.  The way the iPod feel in your hand is so cool.
5	1329868800	Las bondades del Ipod touch, las pude comprobar al haber podido efectuar gracias a la aplicacion FACE TIME, video conferencia con mi familia, sin necesidad de pagos por dicho servicio.Adicionalmente pude adjuntar fotos al instante.
1	1329782400	title says it all don't buy. I rather get the black one now. Battery might last you about 30 mins without doing anything. Waste my time and birthday money.
5	1329782400	Great price for the new slim white iPod touch. My girlfriend loves it! And it even got here early. :D
5	1329782400	I purchased my used Apple iPod 4th Generation 8GB and am very please with it. I love the camera and the background it comes with. I am having a blast with it. I received it within 5 days of ordering it, it was wrapped nicely and protected. I appreciate the time the sender took to ensure the safety of my product. I honestly do not see the point in owning a smartphone when my iPod does everything I would use my smart phone for and it is AMAZING!
5	1329782400	i love this Ipod soo much! i would most definitely recommend this to a friend. This is the best Ipod i have.. i have three others and this one is better than all of them combined.
5	1329696000	My tween kids HAD to have one of these, so I made them save their money and buy it themselves.  I thought it was quite an expensive little toy.  However, I have since learned it is a huge money saver.Besides the great MP3 playing, high quality videos, kindle app, facetime and i-message features, there is an app that lets them text message their friends for FREE in any wi-fi hot spot.  This app gives them their own phone number and they have the ability to send and receive texts to ANY cell phone or iPod in any wi-fi hot spot.  Since our home is a wi-fi hotspot I do not need to pay for an expensive cell phone plan with texting.  With their i-Pod, this app, and a wi-fi hotspot they are good to go!It has already paid for itself with that one little feature.Besides goofing off with friends, they also use it to carry a Kindle Bible, so at church they can easily look up verses.This is Mom approved.  I think they spent their money wisely.
5	1329696000	This is the first new Apple product I've purchased since about 2005 and before this I've had several android devices including a G1 and two different Android Tablets. I have to say that I am VERY impressed with this ipod 4G. This thing hands down smokes both android tablets in speed as well as stability and iOS is far more impressive than I would have imagined. The battery life is incredible, even when watching video. I'm not a huge gamer, but do play from time to time and there simply is no comparison at all between the iOS and Android. Games in iOS are extremely high quality graphics and have a very responsive game play. I downloaded NBA JAM just to see how it would run, and it actually plays great! Fast detailed graphics and nearly as good and a handheld device specifically designed for games.I also bought iMovie and Garage Band, it's very cool to be able to edit video right on the device, however iMovie needs some updates. It's a bit limited but works okay. There's another editor on the market called "splice" that's slightly better in my opinion. I'm a pro musician and I think Garage band is very cool, though definitely more of a toy. I wouldn't produce final products with it, but its decent for working out ideas.The cameras are great, HD video looks good, front camera is a bit grainy, but fine for skype, chat and other items. Skype btw works a million times better than it does on my androids. Also headphones with the built in mic work fine on it as well, so this makes the iPod a great travel companion.Here are my only two complaints about the device; Like I said before I am a musician, so I was really hoping to be able to record practice and shows with the audio recorder, but unfortunately this is not possible AS IS, the reason is there is no audio level adjustment! Music just makes it clip and is totally unlistenable. There are external microphone solutions on the market, but it'll cost you an extra $70 to $100. The other complaint are the headphones that come with it are rather uncomfortable, though sound decent. I had great headphones already to use, so it wasn't a big deal. The main issue is the recording level adjustment.I plan on buying a mic for audio soon, and with all of the other great features, I can live with it. But would like to see this feature in future models. Seems like a simple thing since even the oldest Win 95 systems were able to do this.
4	1329696000	This is a great product.  My son really enjoys it.  Apple's iOS could use some improvements though such as more granular parental controls.  And why does Apple insist on not showing the battery percentage on iPod Touches?  Some of the things iOS does not do annoys me (why no widgets!).  But I jailbreak to allow some of the basic functionality to be added.This is definitely the iPod to have, and is IMO the only mp3 player to consider.
5	1329696000	I just purchased a brand new 4th gen iPod to replace my 2nd gen iPod. The difference is amazing! The colors are so much brighter, the games load so much quicker, and now I can take pictures anywhere I have my iPod with me because it has a camera built right in! This is a wonderful upgrade to my old iPod. I love Apple products and highly recommend this one!
5	1329609600	I love iPod touch mainly because it is touch screen. Technically it's not the touch but how you have various things you within it. The apple Apps like the games are fun and there is soemthing to download that are free. You can read the news or just have apps for your our amusement. If you like music i recomand the classic and if you just want a ipod get the nano. Get the touch if you want enterainment. That is the primarly reason why i bought the touch. Overall i had multi apple products and the touch is the best.
5	1329523200	I purchased this Ipod a month ago and it have been the best purchase I've ever made on amazon. This product is amazing, theres nothing you can't do with it, I mean, in the app store you can find any book you want, any famous game you want, you can be a Dj and you can even have your own personal trainer for the gym! Apple did great with the ipod touch 4G, I can't wait for them to release a new generation because if this is amazing the next one will be... I dont know but it will be more than amazing. In the other hand, the shippment and the amazon service were great, it arrived as expected and I got the color I asked for (white).
5	1329523200	My son loves it.  He has had no problems with it at all.  He especially like the video and camera abilities.
5	1329523200	The camera in the iPod Touch completes the functionality I needed.  The longevity of each charge is far greater than the iPad.  I am a happy camper with the purchase.
5	1329523200	My first apple product is this iPod touch. I'm really amazed and impressed at what you can do with this thing.  I got it for the games, email and Internet but find myself using it for so much more ( music, Netflix, reading and math for my son with learning disabilities, etc.  I highly recommend one.  Best price was here at Amazon.
5	1329523200	My  kids can not get enough of it!  Always using it, even while they  sleep it seems! GREAT PRODUCT,Alotof features.Like a mini tablet. Highly reccomend.
5	1329436800	Apple iPod Touch 8GB 4th Generation(White) works great!!! It has great speed, no lag what so ever. The camera on it is a .7 MGP, not the greatest, but at least we got on on the touch. The iPhone camera is a 5.0 MGP, so to those who were thinking the 4th Gen and the iPhone had the same camera. Its not. Over all good.
2	1329436800	Yesturday I received my ipod in the mail.  The first problem arose trying to plugthe cord into the ipod to charge the battery had a terrible time getting it in andout.  The back of the ipod is all scratched up as if it was prevously used and Ithought it was brand new?????
5	1329436800	I chose this item so that my 4 year old granddaughter could Skype me whenever she wanted to. And she does just that. She loves it. So how do I feel? love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	1329436800	Very disappointed after getting my 3rd gen iPod i was psyched to get my 4th gen.  My 3rd gen worked for 2years (it broke on my fault).  Ok I'll start with the cons of the 4th gen:  slow CPU, home button breaks quick, (this model holds 6.2Gb), battery is ok, (if your get this I recommend not using the camera quality is so bad.)Pros: skinny.  3rd gen cons:  a little bigger Pros: fast CPU, doesn't freeze, better battery.  So I recommend waiting for gen 5 or get a 3rd gen if you looking for a good iPod now.
5	1329350400	I recieved this product within 6 days. When it arrived, it was in excellent condition and the screen was still fine. However the packaging was not very secure. The phone was excellent and the first time I used it I was able to activate it by making an apple account. Then I just started downloading free apps right away. I have downloaded so many free apps, like reading apps, games, mazes, etc. So many awesome apps out there. I love it. I will definately purchase another one with more GB in the future. I also downloaded an app where you can text for free!!! It's awesome and I do not have to pay a single cent. I love my ipod touch!
3	1329350400	I bought this iPod essentially because I needed a newer one to use all of my favorite apps. Most of the upgrades have made older versions of app useless, and my 2nd Generation iPod (the first that allowed use of purchased apps) essentially only plays music (which is nice and the main reason I bought and iPod to begin with)My problem with the new iPod Touch is that it has a few bugs too many. i don't know how well it was working before the 5.0 update, but after I bought it, the 5.0 update was available, so I can't compare to a previous version. Here are the flaws/new features that differ from the old iPod.CameraThis iPod has not one, but two cameras, a feature that may initially attract those looking for a low-end, all in one, device (and if that's what you want, the iPod Touch is probably your best bet). Unfortunately, the rear camera is horrible. I thought the rear one was supposed to be HD, but unless you have good lighting, the pictures are of horrible quality. For those people who know about adjusting aperture/shutter speed/film speed, you will be sorely disappointed as there is no way to do that. They didn't even include the basic "modes" (macro, landscape, portrait) that low-end cameras usually include. As of right now, I haven't seen an app for that, so I wouldn't rely too much on the rear camera.But this iPod also has a fantastic front facing camera. Again, without decent lighting, this will take pretty low quality pictures, but it is focused perfectly for closer range images (presumably for face time). If you can figure out how to take pictures using the front camera without looking at the screen (where, coincidentally, is the only camera buttons location, there is no nifty side button or anything,) then you're in luck.WiFiComparing to my old iPod, connecting this one to the internet is a breeze. Most of the time, all you have to do is switch the WiFi on, and, usually in under fifteen seconds, you're connected! My old iPod would take anywhere from 30 seconds to a full minute to connect.My old iPod would also only connect when the signal was relatively strong. Not a problem for this iPod! Even in places in the house where all of our laptops have trouble connecting, I can usually get at least a bar on the new iPod, where before I was just out of luck.AppsThe apps I have tested an used one this iPod work far better, faster, etc. then they did on my old iPod, but unfortunately this only applies when they work. I don't know if this is because of the 5.0 update, but most of the apps (including proprietary Apple ones) are buggy and crash somewhat frequently. This is true even of the music app, which to be honest, is still the reason why I'm using an iPod. It should work. Speaking of...MusicThe music application on the iPod works well - when it works. More often then not, however, it freezes, pauses songs while I'm in the middle of using other apps, sometimes doesn't skip to the next song when I press the skip button, it freezes and crashes when I'm doing nothing but listening to songs. In my opinion, it is, at its core, an iPod - shouldn't the music app above all else work?ShortcutsDouble tapping the "home" button when the device is locked will still let you pause, skip, or skip backwards and has the added bonus of a small camera button to take you to the camera application. Here's where the good ends. Half the time when using this screen, it doesn't work, or causes the iPod to freeze, and you won't be able to do anything with your iPod for another few minutes (which is really annoying).When actually using another app, if you decide to change the music, you can't do so by double tapping the home screen as with the old iPod touch. Double tapping the home button while the device is unlocked brings up a dock with the last four used application up. Useful if you frequently use iHeartRadio or other app to listen to music, but not so much if you just want to press next without leaving an app. (speaking of - Yay! This version allows other apps to run in the background. That is a feature Apple wouldn't let other apps do initially. Though maybe that's why it freezes so much?)Lock/ Power Down button.The location of the black button on the top back of the device has been moved from the left, to the right - something that took me a week to get used to.  It doesn't seem to work as quickly as on my old iPod, but that's a minor flaw, and doesn't really bother me too much.HeadphonesThe included headphones have seriously been improved from the ones I received with my old iPod. The ones with my old iPod were uncomfortable, and broke almost immediately. These new ones (which have a built in mic - necessary for Skype, Facetime, etc, there is no built in mic) are far more comfortable in the ear and don't seem to tangle as easily.Outside Design.If there is one characteristic that both iPods fail at, it is the outside design. Yes, it's pretty (that goes double for the new one), but it seems designed to slip right out of your hands (though I have smaller hands, maybe this works better for those with larger hands). My old iPod touch has several large cracks in the glass, a result of having been dropped countless times over the past few years. The back of the device has also slipped off several times as a result of being dropped. I have a skullcandy case for the new one, but when it was outside of the case, it slipped right out of my fingers. I would have been absolutely devastated if it had cracked then, and hopefully the skullcandy case will keep it safe.App StoreThe app store is incredibly similar to the one on my old iPod touch, but with one major difference. The new app store actually allows you to download all of your purchased apps! Every app I've ever purchased/downloaded, including ones from when I first got my iPod a few years ago and completely forgot about, are archived and available for download.StacksIf you've seen iPhone/iPod commercials, you've probably also seen information about "stacks." For those of you who haven't it's essentially a folder that makes it easier to organize apps. For example, I have a stack labeled "books" inside that stack are iTunes U, iBooks, and the Kindle app. This new feature allows me to have dozens of apps on the home screen. But, for whatever reason, it seems you can't move the new "Newstand" app into a stack...OverallIf you want to use apps, but without paying the data/messaging rates required for an iPhone, the iPod touch is probably your best alternative. The flaws make it seem as though Apple has stopped trying as hard, and you may just want to wait until the new one comes out (which, is presumably sometime this year). It might be worth the wait.As a commuting college student, the iPod touch has been invaluable. Since security alerts and classes being cancelled are often emailed, it is impractical to wait until I get home to check messages. When I use public transit, I can use my iPod to listen to music and play games. On occasion, I've forgotten to bring my cell phone to school, and one time my cell was stolen. The free texting apps (which, on the new one also have free calling features) have made sure this isn't a huge problem.  The flaws and bugs however will make me carry around my old iPod, just so I can be assured I can listen to music without the device crashing.
5	1329350400	Chose one day shipping and it got here in one day. The packaging could have been a bit better. The bottom of the ipod had little black dirty marks i cant take off but you can BARELY see them. Not to expensive. first day and im loading music already... excited
5	1329350400	I had an iPod mini for years and loved it, but wanted to upgrade. I bought the iPod touch 8G and I am so in love that I went and bought an iMac. I love all things Apple because of the simplicity and the way that they share info. I am not techno savy, so Apple is perfect for me!
5	1329350400	What can you say the Apple products are just great and this one does everything you need. Purchased this particular product for my 10 year old grandson, who is one little happy camper!
5	1329264000	I really like the IPOD touch.  MY one big mistake was getting only 8GB.  If I purchase the 32GB also I am truly lost!  #techjunkie
5	1329177600	Got this as a gift for my son and he is very happy with it  Put all his games and music on this so he could use it instead of his iPhone
1	1329177600	The speaker broke after day of use but it works if you use the headphones I will try to send it in.
5	1329177600	I bought this for 188 dollars and its so cool it has a front facing camera VGA quality and a rear facing camera about 1MP quality but can shoot 720P HD video and its pre loaded with Apples newest operating system IOS 5 so for anyone who cant afford a iPhone on contract or out right, and your still looking for a iPhone type experince than buy this iDevice you will really enjoy it and the fact its WHITE instead of traditional BLACK makes it even better.
5	1329177600	I sold my black one of two years that I got when it came out on Craigslist for the white 4th generation because it's WAY cuter to me. It looks like an iPhone 4 or something. Don't worry about it getting dirty, buy some cheap screen protectors off Amazon and you're good to go! Plus a cute case, like blue or pink. Incipio is my favorite.Can't say too much about the iPod because I've had it for a while so I'm used to all the features except that Amazon takes YEARS to ship. It took me like a week to finally see that it had shipped and then another week to actually arrive..It's a great iPod, it's a mini computer basically with all the amazing apps in the App Store and things you can do on this. I used to listen to music on it but now I just watch Youtube on it for music, so I don't waste my 8GB on music. I like playing apps and games with my boyfriend instead. :)THANKS APPLEEE. 
4	1329091200	I think it is a great product. The only thing about it is it has a short battery life. It may be because I play 3-D games for 1 1/2 hours, but I have to charge it every night. But over all I think it is a great buy.
5	1329091200	This iPod is awesome. i love it sooooooooooooo much, the games are amazing and the display is wonderful. I love it, love it,love it, love it, love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you should get this, it is a wonderful gift for anyone!
5	1329004800	This was a perfect gift for a grandchild.  It arrived in time and packaging was excellant.  Makes for a lot of fun and easy to use even for 4th graders
4	1329004800	regular ipod. works great.  my kid loves it.  a bit costly with no special discounts.  saved money on tax only reason bought here.
5	1329004800	I had a 2nd generation Ipod touch and loved it but had to buy headphones with mic to talk on it but the 4th generation Ipod touch has it's own mic and camera...the camera takes good pics but you have very little mps so you can not enlarge the pics...good buy!
5	1329004800	This is one of the best things i own! i love my iPod touch!! I got mine just over a year ago from Christmas, and i absolutely love it! However, for some reason the home button on mine sometimes takes me pressing it 3 or  times to exit out of an app. This started about a month ago and i don't know why. However, this is still the best product ever!!
5	1328918400	I am delighted with my iPod touch.  I bought it primarily to download audio books from the public library.  It's so easy to do.  I also bought the sports arm band and I can do housework for hours while listening to a book.  The time goes by much faster and in such a pleasant way.  I also use it at the gym and can ride the exercycle for more than an hour without realizing it.  The capacity is pretty good and Apple is very good at notifying me of upgrades to the software.  I highly recommend it.
5	1328918400	amazing device, nothing more to say about that..shipping was done at and amazing speed..way early than wat was promsied at the time of order..
5	1328918400	This is just amazing! Besides the camera everything is pixel, but besides that amazing sound, great LCD, and much more!
5	1328918400	Delivery was on time. And I can't take my ear pieceOut of my ears. The new iPod touch is a must haveCan't work out with out it
5	1328745600	GreatIBut I didn't know that other things like the Screen Protectors and the Gummy Cover were not coming with the ipod. You should have told me this.I have to wait now! It's too bad.
5	1328745600	Bought this ipod for my son to use.  He loves it!  The 8G is already almost used up though but it's OK by the time he gets sick of playing an app, he just deletes it and adds another.
5	1328659200	My son didn't know what he wanted for Christmas (I always give a choice of presents to my kids), so I decided to surprise him and got iPod Touch. The smile on child face on Christmas morning is priceless. He likes it, use it to quickly check weather before heading to school, downloaded few games to play (no more "Are we there yet?" on the long trips), downloaded few reference application for school use (his school is actually sponsoring Apple products and allow usage of Apple products on the open book tests). He likes to listen to music on it and chat on the FaceTime with me while I am away (I know that I can use Skype too but Facetime is good too option). The only thing that he didn't like was a headphone, sound is shallow and not comfortable for child ear. So I got him Sennheiser CX200 headphone and he loves his iPod.
5	1328659200	Great product for great price! My son loves it and I love that he is not bothering me to change the channel on the radio.
5	1328659200	This apple iPod is a great product, suits all of my needs at work and at home. It is easy to use and to handle. The shipping was fast as well.
3	1328659200	they are overal good but the screans if u even drop them on soft things the screan always breaks then u have to go and pay more to get that repleaced bout the only bad thing about them
5	1328659200	This was ordered for a friend who got two of them.  This is the 4gen and I like it.  I have a 2nd gen and plan on getting on myself.  Like the fact that you can take pictures.  I did take it out of the box and charged it for them.  Item was shipped fast and arrived in good condition.
5	1328572800	This ipod was a gift for my niece, she absolutely loved it. I was skeptical in purchasing the color white it just seemed right for a girl. I was right! the color if real cool and any case you put on looks real cool.
5	1328572800	First of all I would say OMG...It is amazing how this thing work...I am like on it all day, all night...When I first purchase it, I just couldnt get anything done, because I was so addicted...I am always going back from lunch late, because I am on the games all the time...My son wanted me to read a book to him, but I was too into the game and he fell asleep...It is so convient for when I am on the go and my 4 yr old son loves it...So iam thinking I will have to buy him one as well, cause I am getting jealous of him having it...I love it and look forward to purchasing some gadgets to go along with it...Thanks Apple...mini computer when I am on the go :)
5	1328486400	Got the product I was expecting and was in its original packaging. The shipping was very quick and nothing was wrong with the product when it arrived
3	1328486400	I had a first iPod touch, and liked it at that time and after almost 2 years I bought this thinking it would be dramatically faster or something but it is still almost same deal. Disappointed.
5	1328486400	This iPod is almost exactly like an iPhone and it is so much fun to have because my friend wants one and I don't want to let him use it. I know it sounds mean but I like this thing and I haven't had this device for long at all. I would recommend this iPod to anyone that asks if it is worth the price.
5	1328486400	I got this for my niece for 2012 Christmas and she is really enjoying it. I think she really likes the feature that allows her to snap photos of her friends and its seems to be easier to navigate and it is thinner so more easy to carry. So far absolutely no complaints, good job Apple.
5	1328486400	This is an amazing little device and it literally goes everywhere with me short of the shower. This device is perfect for anyone who does not currently have or plan on getting an I-phone as this will do everything the I-phone 4 will do besides connecting to a cellular network. With the countless number of apps available, there is something for everyone on this thing. Instead of writing on everything this thing can do which would make this a very long review, I'm just going to cover the main things I use it for.Music: This is a no brainer. Like the original I-pod it plays music and does so brilliantly. I own an 8 GB Touch and with my entire music library loaded on the device, I still have plenty of room for all my apps.Camera: It has a camera on the front and rear, but what makes this different from any old cell phone camera are the countless fun camera apps available. I have about a half dozen camera apps to include Hipstamatic, Instagram, Camera+, Tiny Planets, Tilt Shift, PS Express and more. It really does make taking pictures a lot of fun and this is coming from someone who owns a $2,000.00 DSLR.Skype/ Face Time: Although it's not an I-phone, as long as you have an internet connection this can be used just like a phone. I keep in touch with my family and through Skype and Face Time is just a wonderful feature. For those who are not familiar with Face Time, it uses the camera on the front so that you can see who you are talking to. Obviously, the other person also needs Face Time for this to work which is currently available only on I-Touch 4th Gen, I-Phone 4 and I suppose the 4s.Games: Just about any game you could imagine is available through the app store.  Most of the more popular title come in two different versions, a Lite version and the full version. The full version typically offers more options, but the Lite version is free (think of it as a DEMO). In the end, if you like the game, you pay $0.99 for the full version for most games. Here are a few of the games on my Touch, (Chess, Solitaire, Spades, Tetris, Mahjong, Fruit Ninja and my personal favorite, Angry Birds)Nike+ GPS: If you are a runner or even walk for exercise this is a great app to have. The GPS feature does not work the same as it would for an I-phone so you have to calibrate it, but once it is calibrated it works great. Also, for the I-Touch 4th generation model, you no longer need the little sensor to use the app so don't bother getting the sensor. This app tells you how far you run, how long it took, how many calories you burned and keeps track of your progress all while listening to your favorite music.Internet: I use my I-touch quite a bit to browse the internet. The display is outstanding and perfect for viewing You Tube clips as well as updating your status on Facebook. With a lot more places offering free WiFi service, this gives you internet access just about anywhere you go these days.Other: This review is already long enough so I will end by just mentioning a few other apps I use on my Touch. (Translate: Language translator), (RL Classic: bar code scanner), (Good Player: movie player), (Turbo Scan: document scanner), (GuiTune Lite: guitar tuner), (Currency: currency converter), (Convert Units: converts measurement i.e. inches -> cm).
5	1328313600	I received my iPod before the estimated date. It has worked wonderfully since I received it and I have not had any problems with it. The iPod was in the original packaging and was in perfect condition!
5	1328227200	I bought one for my sister for Christmas and turned around and bought another one for me. The price was amazing and very affordable. I absolutely love it and so does my sis. She is using it every day and I have mines at work. Great for vacations and when you are doing work around the house. Recommed to everyone.
5	1328227200	I bought it for my 11yr old son in January. It was Delivered in the time frame that was specified in the delivery with no problems,it actually came a few days early much to my surprise.So far no problems with the device, works as expected.  my son loves it and has not put it down since.
3	1328227200	I was worried about getting it because of the screen cracking comments but I never had a problem.  It is definitely only for music though....and games.  You can't use it a lot of places because it's only WiFi so I would say to get a nano or another kind.
5	1328140800	Amazing quality! Simply but a higher GIG! Don't buy the 8 GB unless your just wanting the basics!!!!! I loved it amazing!
5	1328140800	The only con is the slow start-up from being off.  Otherwise, it is amazing.  I got it primarily for playing music, but use it more for other tasks.  I find the free applications are great, from calculators, conversion programs, e-mail, bar code scanners, etc, this is a great device.
5	1328140800	I bought this for my daughter for her 8th bday and she loves it she has downloaded tons of games and she even has me hooked lol. she calls her cousin almost every night using the face time app on it i cld not have asked for a better gift for her, she stays occupied it makes for a really good babysitter u cant go wrong with this purchase..
2	1328140800	I guess this doesn't bother anyone else: I type something in the google search field along the top in Safari- and wham, the box i'm about to type in darts quickly to the left. my eyes then saccade to try to refixate it. I go to type my userid on a website and WHAM - the line darts down suddenly. My eyes try to follow it. I finish that line and WHAM it darts up. I go to close a window and it does all sorts of motions i can't even keep track of - gets small and then moves and so on. Kayboard pops up when i'm not ready for it and keep having to hit "done" and it just keeps coming back. Even the feedback with the letters showing up largely when I type adds to the visual chaos. (though the keyboard issues are minor compared to all the other visual chaos). I find this very frustrating becasue the ipod touch puts the world at my fingertips but then gives me an interface I find unpleasant yet impossible to change. Do others find all this zipping about of things on the screen cool and exicting? or just not mind it? or perhaps have never tried a device that doesn't do this to see how much easier it is on the eyes? this thing leads to eye strain and fatigue so much more quickly than other devices i have.
5	1328054400	I was a little nervous ordering this online. I was afraid it would be refurbished. It is new. We just received it so we are still learing everything about it. I wish it came with regular charger instead of always needing to plug it into the computer. Sorry I dont have more to say.
5	1328054400	Having had this ipod since nov. 2011, its a good thing to have around with you to keep you from boredom.Pros: 1. Its made by Apple.2. Great Retina Display.3. Killer apps.4. Thin and nice to hold.5. Fast internet device.6. 2 Cameras.7. Good battery.Cons: 1. No SD Slot.2. Bad Camera quality.Otherwise it seems to be a great product to have your songs and games on.Its also very good to customize with thousands of cases to choose from.Basically, its a near perfect device, with a few flaws, but its the best from the rest.
4	1328054400	Is a high-tech equipment for its speed and ease of navigation with multiple applications. The recomiento for different use and works.
1	1328054400	If you're looking for something to just play music, this is not it. Stick with the Classic. Plus, it's not very durable. Dropped once on the concrete and the screen shattered. It's Nanos and Classics only for this music lover. The Touch is an expensive, fragile piece of junk, and redundant if you have a Smart Phone.
4	1328054400	I LIKE IT VERY MUCH, HAD PROBLEMS DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING THE I TUNES SOFTWARE, I HAVE WINDOWS XP, AND UPON LAUNCHING ITUNES MY COMPUTER WOULD CRASH, THIS HAPPENED TWICE, I CALLED TECH SUPPORT AND AFTER A LONG TIME IT WORKED. OVER ALL I WOULD BUY AGAIN.
4	1327968000	I brought this 4 my lil sister, its great for kids & game apps, ect but if u thinking about use it 4 working out dont wast your time once u break a sweat your fingers are not so good on the touch screen, screen does not read finger, making you have to stop ur workout, I use my classic 4 working out, thats why 4 stars {wish they put skip buttons next to home button that way u wouldnt hav to touch the screen] then 5stars
5	1327968000	thanx so much for ipod touch 4th generation it worx so well i like it alot better then the other ipod models..... its UNIQUE thats for sure definately alot more compact and thinner then the earlier models which to me is very impressive.  Thanx Guys 110%%%%%%%%% thanx amazon!!!!!!! as well
1	1327968000	when you order a 4th generation and expect to get a 4th end up with a 3rd generation, none of the accessories will fit it.  u must get 4th generation accessories with 4th generation i pod.  just saying.  i returned item
5	1327968000	I bought this mainly for playing games on trips but have expanded it to much more.I had a steep learning curve as this was my first time using a touch screen.  Now I'm getting used to it, and use a stylus many times to save frustration on my part. The people at the Apple Store in Jacksonville, FL have been a wonderful to this newbie, spending time with me and helping me get a bit more familiar with the device.I am really enjoying it as it is light weight and fits into a pocket very easily. I have to recharge the battery daily and I don't know if that's normal but it's really no problem.
5	1327968000	All of my children LOVE THIS --ages 9-17 :)I was a little unsure of this purchase due to the cost but it has been worth every cent
3	1327968000	Most people love this product - until it dies.  We had a 2nd generation unit fail after a year.  I took it apart and found defective soldering of the main connector as the cause.  These were not too hard to take apart to replace the touchscreen, LCD, or battery.  My daughter just dropped her 4th gen and shattered the touchscreen.  These now are glued together, with the touchscreen also glued to the LCD.  Now it requires great skill to fix and you must almost always change both the digitizer and LCD.Apple has designed this so the glass edge is exposed, so almost any drop will kill it.  I suppose they sell many more new iPods that way.
5	1327881600	My son loves the Apple IPod, he has not put it down since he got it for Christmas. Great price and delivery was amazing just in time for Christmas.Thank you Amazon!!
1	1327881600	Took longer than expected to receive, then it didn't work. No warranty info included. Fortunately the local Apple store exchanged it. Not really worth the savings to buy it this way.
5	1327881600	Exactly what I wanted, and came quickly and ready to go. I would recommend this product to anyone who thinks they might want it.
5	1327881600	So, this thing is pretty amazing. theres always something for you to do. ive never owned anything touchscreen, and i immediately got used to typing, tapping, etc. theres so many apps to choose from. front and rear cameras are a great feature, but the quality isnt that good. the video isnt really that "HD" but its good quality. the retina is definitely a plus, it makes the screen look stunning. its amazing how many apps there are, you can find one for basically anything! i honestly dont know the quality of the sound through the headphones, because ive never used them, but the speaker quality isnt scratchy at all. it comes out pretty clear to me. i got a texting app, so now i can text&call all my friends for free, with a real number! :D some of the downsides are that the back immediately scratched once i took the protective film off. also, the battery life isnt that great. my mom took it away(depressing, i know) and after two days of just sitting there, it died. i know it died because on "find my iphone" it couldnt locate it after 2 days, and when i tried calling it, there was no sound. Also, it can break easily, so i suggest getting some kind of protector. 8 gb fills up pretty fast, so if you love apps and movies, you should get the 32 gb. when i used it, i couldnt stop, its so addicting! for around $200, i think its a pretty good item to buy. honestly, i think this is a must-have. also, i never owned an itouch, and i didnt even need the manual. (: ps.- im a 13 y/o girl. haha.
5	1327795200	the i pod is great and i have not had any problems as i bought it for a teen which all known that they dont take care off things
5	1327795200	I purchased this for my 13 yr. old granddaughter, she just loves it.  She takes it everywhere she goes.  I also purchased a cover for it, which she also loves, and car and home charger.  SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT.  Amazon is wonderful.
5	1327795200	The iPod was shipped and received within the time it said it would be, which was great.  the item has not given me any problems; I love it and appreciate the service!
5	1327795200	good, every thing very good.Es lo que esperaba,tambien fue enviado en el lapso prometido.Considero que es una buena opcioon para comprar
5	1327708800	this ipod works great and works very well when i got it, it wasnot even open so good im pleased
4	1327708800	I love everything about my new iPod, it wakes me up in the morning when I travel, it gives me a weather reeport to start my day.  I get my email at a fingers touch, and can take a picture of a sunset. My grankids love angry bird (me too) and I love scrabble.It goes everywhere I go.
5	1327708800	Love the touch. I just got my first iPhone 4 months ago and LOVED it. Got 2 itouch for my 4 year old boys. They love it. There are some really great educational apps for them.  They're learning and having a great time. No issues at all with either touch. Just got the iPad for the husband. We r now official Mac converts
1	1327622400	I have been waiting for three and one half months and it hasnt arrived yet. I am tired of waiting whaere is my package.
4	1327622400	I really enjoy my iPod touch, I did not have any problems with it so far. It is very resistant as I dropped it once by mistake and it still works and looks great. If you want a cheaper variant to the iPhone I definitely recommend buying an iPod Touch.However, I have to mention that I am mostly using it for e-mail, music, some games, but nothing too consuming.One downside is that it does not support Flash, but it's bearable.
5	1327622400	Great product at a great price. Bought as a gift for my daughter. Looked everywhere in stores but no one had it and they were more expensive. Amazon had it and cheaper! Love Amazon!
5	1327622400	I bought this for my twelve year old son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. He uses it daily and it seems very easy for him to navigate through; he hasn't had a difficult time figuring out how to use it. It has kept him from being "bored" because he can download music, games and other apps.  I'm very happy that I got this for him and would definitely recommend it.
5	1327622400	Once I received my iPod I immediately took it out and started playing with it. I had no problem with figuring it out it's very user friendly people of all ages would love this product.
5	1327622400	Received the piece in perfect condition and no complaints at all :))If you intend to buy this product do not hesitate...
4	1327536000	I'm afraid that I'm giving this a 4 star review instead of the 5 that I would like to.  I recieved a 1st generation IPod Touch, but over the years advances in hardware and software has made it obsolete. So I decided it was time to replace it with a more up-to-date model.  I loved the concept of the Touch and really enjoy it.  I just wish Apple would NOT take up so much memory by installing permanent Apps.  I'm not a Wallstreet Guru so I'm not interested in Stocks which is permanently install OR into on-line games that much and again the Game Center takes up needed memory that I could use with more apps that I'm interested.  I'm sorry, but you can buy better Weather & Maps apps than what Apple has permanently install on the Touch if that's what you're interested in.+.
5	1327536000	It was a gift for my daughter, as I already have one. We both love it and the endless possibilities on it.. Cant say enough about the iPod!!!
5	1327449600	My daughter loves this iPod!!!!  She rates it a 10 out of 10.  She was sooo excited to get it.  Good price for a lot of fun!
3	1327449600	I purchased the Apple Ipod touch 8GB for Christmas for my daughter and was disappointed when It came and seen it was a 6GB.I paid for an 8 I should have received an 8 not a 6.I learned my lesson. So please be careful if you are thinking of purchasing this just in case this happens to you.
5	1327363200	Got this for my wife for her birthday. She loves it great buy for any and all. The white looks really good too.
5	1327363200	I just love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Super product. It is very convenient  specially for traveling. I will recommended it to everybody who likes to listen to books on audio. Save time.
5	1327363200	The purchase and dellivery was done exactly as was stated by the advisory notice from Amazon. The iPod is wonderful.
5	1327276800	Dual iPhone / iPod Splitter Cable. Charge up to Two Apple Devices At Once From a Single USB PortTHe ipod was a great Christmas gift.  Would you pleas send me the 15% coupon from my purchase.  I can't locate the coupon sent to me after my purchase.  Thank you, Coach Benacka.
1	1327276800	I am on my FOURTH 4th generation IPod touch and they have all been garbage. On One the screen sensitivity stopped working and the screen broke while attempting to open an APP it just splintered around me finger, the hiome button was defective on two others and now I can't get the Wifi to stay on. My 2 tablets, my phone and my computer never lost connectivity but my IPod couldn't connect. Believe me I tried EVERYTHING I could find online and I called Apple customer service for each device and I had to send back each time. I bought one refurbished and the rest were BRAND NEW. I will never purchase another Apple product. I jope someone comes along to give them competition so more people can see their products for the overpriced garbage that they are.
5	1327276800	Bought this for my son for Christmas.  He loves it. I think it is very nice. I love that it has a camera in the front and the back side of this.  Very Cool.  He had it less than a month and the screen shattered.  Amazon sent a replacement no questions asked.  Paid for shipping to ship it and to ship the broken one back.  Great Customer service!  Now we have it in an Otterbox Defender case!  I wish otterbox made them for the new Kindles!  No issues with this product.  Works great.
5	1327276800	This is one of my best buys ever.  The price for this product was great and it has been very durable and a pleasure to have.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for such a device.
5	1327276800	This gadget will do about anything-my husband loves the games and swipes it.  Probably should get him his own!  I use it for the kindle and audiobook functions the most.  The only complaint I have is that the touch keyboard buttons are so tiny that it's difficult to hit the right selection and so invariably it takes several attempts to type in a password, etc.
5	1327190400	Order was lost, I called Amazon. They sent a replacement the very next day OUTSTANDING. Execelent customer service. A satisfied customer
5	1327190400	I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. As with everything that Apple makes, it is an absolutely awesome iPod. My boyfriend can't get enough of it and uses it for everything. He has quit downloading apps on his Smart phone and now just uses his iPod. Amazon got my purchase sent to me within a couple days and it arrived on Christmas eve, just in time for Christmas!!! I am very pleased with my purchase and love ordering from Amazon. Purchases from Amazon never let me down.
5	1327190400	Is a great product. Holds tons of music and the video quality is outstanding. Also the pictures that are taken with it are spectacular!! Only wish was that there was a flash. Other than that, great product.
5	1327190400	PROS -I was paying 20 a month for unlimited internet and Texting for my cell phone. This thing will pay for itself fast.I get free unlimited calling and internet and Texting on the ipod touch 4g.Talkatone free app lets me make make and receive free unlimited calls and free unlimited Text messages.Con -Metal on back SCRATCHES easily, so I got the argyle case on amazon its around 2 bucks with free shipping works great.
5	1327104000	The iPod touch 8GB was exactly what my son wanted for Christmas!  The product was packaged well and arrived very quickly.  I would not have wanted anything to be any different.  Thanks very much,  Susan
5	1327104000	this ipod 4g is a great friend, I can surf the web and facetime my friends (who needs an iphone?) haha.  Anyway. this thang is great and I would highly recommend considering you can score this badboy for under two hundo - i'll take it!
4	1327104000	I have always been a Windows/PC person and seriously through the years kept noticing that Apple computers and all of their products, even though they tend to be considerably higher in price, are superior in quality and performance overall.  This iTouch was given as a birthday gift after my family seen my happiness with a purchase we had made for our daughter at Christmas of an Apple iPad2, which by the way is worth every penny!..  To make this short and sweet don't be afraid to purchase this item! Looks great, works great and it fits in your pocket very easily!  The battery lasts a good amount of time, depending on what your using it for. I love mine and I know you will too!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is because I wish it would be at least $50 cheaper but in reality it's still worth it!  Think of it as a mini computer that you can take anywhere that actually works as opposed to some of the Android based units!  I'm not opposed to Android products but a major problem that I've encountered is their battery life.  Hope this helps!  Now I need to get a case but will look on Amazon because of the great prices compared to the Apple Store!
5	1327104000	Love my iPod Touch--just like an iPhone sans costly monthly subscription charges. Holds a charge well, finds wifi easily and remembers networks and gas access to tons of apps.
5	1327104000	Have noticed it is not quite as "fast" with the navigation as my iphone 4s but this is virtually the same device minus the phone of course. Beautiful form factor...best ipod yet. Pictures are great quality and the facetime and texting with other iOS devices is a super cool feature when it has access to wifi.
5	1327104000	My son's opinion in his words: You should get the product.  It is a very good and practical electronic.  I use it everyday and haven't had a problem.  It is very fun and great to have.  The facetime feature is great to talk with family and friends.  It has very nice video quality.  You should buy it from Amazon right now.
5	1327104000	An awesome little toy to do games and music and all the apps.  Works very well and is lots of fun.  It was shipped very quickly and packaged well.
5	1327104000	I love my Ipod, it fell down like three times and still work like a new one... the sound its clear now I have to buy a Ipod dock, because the battery duration is average, I have to charge it every two days.
3	1327017600	it is very clear compared to the 2g but it keeps crashing all the time. the games look graet but it crashes when playing it a long time and when switching song. my frend has one to and hers crashes to get the 3g or 2g it doe not crash as much
5	1327017600	I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he said that it was the best gift I'd ever given him!  He LOVES it.  Now I want one because I have Kindle envy!
5	1327017600	GOOD PRICE,COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT BETTER WRAPPED FOR A DELICATE ITEM, BUT REC'D IN GOOD CONDITION OVERALL, WORKS FINE SO FAR. SHOPPED SEVERAL SITES, BUT NONE BEAT AMAZON. THE RECIPIENT IS HAVING A GREAT TIME USING THE GREAT FEATURES THAT COME WITH THIS ITEM.THANKS FOR THE FREE...AND FAST SHIPPING.... WAS A PLUS  FOR THE HOLIDAYS!
4	1326931200	Glad when it finally arrived, it was over Christmas holidays, so a delay, but amazon updated me frequently.  My nephew is loving it.
5	1326931200	APPLE!!! need I say more?  I got this shipped to me fast within 3 days and the shipping was free!!!! If you want this ipod buy it! its a no brainer!
5	1326931200	We purchased this for our 8 year old son.  We bought on Amazon because it was the best price around.  We have had zero issues and my son loves it to play games and listen to music!
5	1326844800	For years I have had PDAs (starting with the Palm IIIe) and I love them, as I really have little use for cell phone bills! ;) When Palm went to phones only, and I really wasn't impressed with the one Pocket PC I owned, I looked for an alternative. That's when I got my first iPod Touch (8gig, 3G). For Christmas my father-in-law got me the upgraded 4G iOS5 iPod touch, and I completely love it. I didn't think I'd use the camera as much as I do, but it makes an excellent barcode reader, that I use almost every day. The apps that are available are amazing, with games like Pocket God, Doodle God, and Fruit Ninja it's a wonder I ever get any work done, but the productivity apps are just as good with HanDBase a full database program, and Pages a full word processor it's like having a computer in your pocket. And with all that it's also an iPod so you can take you favorite music, movies and videos with you. The only complaints I have are that I think Apple should have phased out the 8 gig units and went to 16 gig, and maybe considered adding a micro SD slot to expand memory, minor complaints and I have over 40 apps and 300 songs plus a couple of TV shows and still have 1 and a half gig free. All in all a fantastic device, but I do recommend going for the 32 or 64 gig version if you can afford the extra cash.
5	1326844800	When we purchased the iTouch for our daughter for Christmas a few days before Christmas, it came within a few days, just before the big day. We were so pleased with the speed of shipping and with how well the iTouch was packaged. Thank you for helping to make our Christmas great!
5	1326844800	I needed a new MP3 player and my son suggested this, I love it. I use it for so much more than music.
5	1326844800	Within minutes of opening these on Christmas morning my 7 year old Granddaughter and 9 year old Grandson were already downloading new apps and music.They have been using their mothers iphone, now she is glad they have therr own gadgets.. Great item great price!
5	1326844800	I recently purchased a 8GB iPod touch from amazon and I was pleased with the speed of delivery also when my iPod made it here I was very pleased it was in good condition and now it is my favorite toy haven't been able to let it go sense I bought it!
5	1326844800	All my son wanted for Christmas was the iPod 4th generation. After searching the Internet and local shopping places I found the best deal to be here with you guys. The iPod came New and Quickly, I was very impressed by the unit and the speed in which it got here. My son is still loving his iPod... Thanks for making his Christmas special. I will use and recommend you guys in the future. A VERY pleased customer.
5	1326844800	I just want to say that since i got this ipod touch i found it to be the best i have ever used.I love it is very easy to use and the quality of sound and video play is outstanding! I have hadmany different media player and never had anything close to the quality and performance i got fromthis great apple product! I think its also an addicting one since you can watch netflix on it withno problem at all.
5	1326844800	When I ordered the product amazon informed me that it would be much longer than I had hoped telling me it would be 2 weeks at the soonest for it to arrive which was an issure for me because its a gift for my girlfriends birthday. It arrived much faster than the two weeks, just like they stated on their seller details it came very fast and the I pod itself is in great condition, new head phones and a charger like promised. I hope my girlfriend like the gift. I would recommend to anyone, in fact im going to buy myself one.
5	1326844800	I got this as a Christmas present and I have to say I absolutely love the ipod touch! It arrived pretty fast and I have absolutely no complaints:)
5	1326844800	My oldest daughter got this for Christmas and has not put it down since.  She loves all the features, especially while on our WIFI at home.
5	1326758400	I LOVE the apple ipod it is so great. I can do tons of things like play games, take pictures and even surf the web! I would totally recommend this to anyone.
2	1326758400	My daughter loves the ipod touch version 4. She has everything on it and just loves it. I would give it a 4 or 5, but 8 days after getting it for Christmas it slipped out of her coat pocket. The glass shattered, but the cover kept it in. The poor guy at the genius bar had glass shards through his fingers when he took off the cover. Great device, but why you would make the glass that hard (to take scratches) and take the chance of it exploding into little glass pieces for a kid's device is beyond me. Got it fixed and an otterbox is on it's way. Apple over the phone wanted $99 to fix the screen. Went to the store and it got a better.
5	1326758400	I would have to say that this product is one of the best ipods that apple has come out with to this day. I bought it for my sister and she absolutly love it from the video chat, camera, camcorder etc. its great for all freshmen college students i would recommend this product to anyone.way to go apple. also amazon its very protective towards all products so i also would like to thank amazon as well.
2	1326758400	the whole idea to an ipod is to be able to use it on the go whenever you want and keep in touch with anything entertaining but with the battery life on this device, you will only get to use it for about an hour or two if using it for just music abd for videos would probably last for 35 to 45 mins.... just skip over this item dont buy it.... its a waste of time and if you ever have any problems with your itunes account, it requires more money for them to fix your account from itunes.
5	1326758400	Item came very fast from the seller.  The product was in super condition.  I absolutely love this thing!  There are so many free apps that help  me out in my daily life.  I even downloaded a texting app that I can use for people that don't have an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch that I can use just like a regular phone.  I didn't want to purchase an iPhone because the monthly contracts are outrageous so I use a cheapo straight talk phone that has unlimited data, minutes and texting.  But this iPod touch goes everywhere with me, I love it!!!!
5	1326758400	I bought this for my husband for the holidays and he loves it. His car is only equipped to play on an IPod from the stereo. He can't use any MP3 player, so this was perfect for him. It is a little difficult at first to figure out how to download, but we managed and now he uses it all the time.An expensive gift but well worth the money.
4	1326758400	Pro: compatible with my mac...i used to have a Zen and I had to go borrow my brother's laptap just to configure Zen with music and video files. Not anymore!Con: sometimes its hard to turn it on...I would turn on the power button but it won't budge. I'll leave it alone and then turn it on again and it would work just fine.
5	1326672000	I'm very pleased with this purchase! An iPod touch was the only thing my daughter asked for for Christmas. After shopping around some I was happy with the deal I found on Amazon and ordered it with Free shipping! Christmas morning made it worth every cent! She opened the box and had a beyond excited reaction...like an adult winning the lotto!! hahaha Priceless!! It's been a great to see her use it for not only for fun but learning as well. The variety of apps are endless! We are both very happy with her new iPod touch!
5	1326672000	My oldest grandson loves this . Takes it everywhere he has used the phone on it and is learning how to be responsible with it.Listening to music is just what he wanted.
5	1326672000	I love this iPod.  It does everything that the iphone does except you cannot make phone calls.  All the services that I like are free.  I especially love the face time app and the words with friends app.  These 2 features are why I bought this iPod.  My life has improved with the abilty to see my family on face time.  Way better than skype.  Highly recommend this product.
4	1326672000	I like this ipod very much, But unless you want it to break i would get a case for it. I suggest buying "Trident Case Aegis". The thin rubber cases arn't good enough. I Had an ipod, I dropped it and the glass shatter'd. So now i'm buying a new one.-Pros:Touch screen is easy to use and navigate with.The Apps don't take up too much space.It has good sound quality.-Cons:The camera is low grade considering how much the ipod cost.touch screen is very fragile.Unless you want it to break, You have to put a super thick case on it, Which defeats the idea of it being "Slender".
5	1326672000	Purchased this Ipod Touch for my Daughter.  We searched for one in our local stores, Who were completely sold out.  We found an exceptional deal and super fast shipping at Amazon.  Thanks again Amazon, for offering fantastic products at great prices!!
5	1326585600	It takes alot for a "gadget" to interest my husband. I purchased this iPod tough 8GB for Xmas and he hasn't put it down except to sleep and work. If he could get away with it a work, he'd have it there too. I may end up having to have it surgically removed from his hand.....Thankyou iPod.
5	1326585600	This was given as a Christmas gift, the person who received it was ecstatic. I have an old 5th generation ipod classic and have had it for over 5 years, i am sure she will be happy with it for a while.
5	1326585600	well my cousin ipod, works great i mean, its apple what can i say, i got it in xmas deal so i saved a couple bucks,
5	1326585600	I gave this I pod touch to my 13 yr old daughter for Christmas and she hasn't put it down yet! She downloaded all of her favorite songs( at least 300 so far) and surfs the Internet while listenining to music! She loves the million apps available to download at the app store ! I am addicted to angry birds! Apple makes the best products ever, and Amazon delivers the product on time at unbeatable prices.Ps... This product is not just for kids, I'm going to treat myself To one for my birthday in February !
5	1326585600	I cannot review this item since I purchased it as a gift for our youngest grandson.  All I know is that he is very happy with it.
4	1326585600	We got this for our 11 year old from Santa for christmas. It was a great pick. We got it thinking it would help prepair her for the coming years of the cyber world and cell phones. We haven't figured everything out yet but there is a maturity level fir this product as it does have Internet on it. I love the fact she can look at apps but without the password she can't purchase anything not even the free stuff. It would be cool if there was an app to allow the iPod to text other products except the iPhone/iPad/iPod products.In all this was a great buy! It is just like the iPhone 4 w/out the phone part. If u want an iPhone but can't afford one this is the next best thing in my book!
5	1326585600	I bought this for my 15 year old son this Christmas and he has enjoyed it SO much! The camera takes amazing pictures and the new capability to hook it up to an HD TV to play your games on a big screen is SO cool! I have an iPad, and even though I enjoy the much bigger screen, I'm jealous of the camera he has on his iPod 4G! It's a fantastic product and well worth the money!
5	1326499200	I got this as a Christmas present for my eight year old daughter. I've never seen her so infatuated with a man made product. I don't believe I could have gotten her a better gift.The wife and I, and even our three year old daughter, also enjoy it. It really has something to offer for all ages.
5	1326499200	I will admit I wrote a pretty bleak review on the 1st Gen iPod touch, but with this one I really have only one minor complaint, in that the battery needs to be charged too often for my taste, but I will say again this only a minor complaint.  But aside from the battery this thing is a joy to own.  It was a breeze to sync with our home wifi, and it's simple to use.  I like it so much I got one for my son for Christmas.In conclusion, I tend to measure purchases of this sort by how much or little grief they give me, and by reliability.  So far this iPod has delivered no grief, and it works every time in whatever I ask of it.
5	1326499200	I really love this phone and use it for work and entertainment.  It pretty much has it all but I don't even know what half of it does.
5	1326499200	I brought this iTouch for my little daughter as a Christmas gift. The iTouch came earlier (12/21) than expected. She opened the box immediately :)
5	1326499200	I got this iPod for my 13 year old son for christmas.  He uses it everyday and loves it.  The camera works good and he was very pleased with the $30 free downloads.  It was everything I expected.
4	1326499200	Bought the 8gb and have had no issues with storage/speed of the device.  As i thought the battery drains rather fast but that is to be expected with the smart devices.
5	1326499200	Great deal.  Picks up wi-fi networks quickly and easy to download music and apps.  Perfect for my 13-year-old. Item was received within 5 days.
4	1326499200	because its the latest technology its got to be ridiculously expensive, but it is capable of many high quality things that earlier ipods couldn't do...i adjusting volume is only annoying thing to me, the slightest touch and the volume can be moved louder or softer than your desired level...
5	1326412800	I cant not complain. I received my item in good condition. The jod was done at my satisfaction. Thank you.
4	1326412800	I got this iPod for Christmas and I think it's great, but now that I have seen some people with the Kindle Fire, I'm thinking it might have liked to have it instead.  They are both the same price and from my understanding have a lot of the same features, but the Kindle is a larger tablet as opposed to this tiny iPod.  I don't really know how the Kindle interface is though and I have always been a big Apple fan.
5	1326412800	Wow! Very fast shipping! Received item in 2 days! It was supposed to arrive on the 17th. Thank you amazon. As for the iPod, just as I expected great camera, hd video, and very thin! (thinner than my 2g)! I cannot wait until my case comes and it will be complete!
5	1326412800	I had a great experience purchasing thsi product.  The product was received in a timely fashion and was received as it was advertised.
5	1326412800	My 5th generation iPod was stolen and I was going to replace it with same product.  So glad I didn't...the Touch is great!!  Concerned I should have bought larger than 8GB, but for me it's plenty...
5	1326412800	The iPod I ordered came in on time, and was exactly as I ordered. My daughter loves it and uses it all the time!
5	1326412800	Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas, she couldn't be happier (except now she wants an iPhone 4s). It was an upgrade from her previous 3rd generation iPod touch, and well worth the price.Also appreciate fast shipping and delivery by Amazon in time for the Christmas!
5	1326412800	Bought this in lieu of a new smart phone for my 12 year old daughter's birthday.  With all the apps, there is hardly a need to keep her cell phone.  Free text msg apps, face time to make phone calls, and of course the games and music.  The new color is HOT and looks really sharp.  Happy kid = happy Mom.
5	1326412800	i had the ipod 1g since launch date decided to go for the 4g. mainly beasue the apps demanded i needed a new firmware to use them :\i love the 4g version espically the camera and the voice recording it has its very useful for me when im in college saves me money on recording and picture taking for my medical school.
5	1326326400	This device is as ordered, came promptly, and met expectations. The purchase price was a $1.00 less than Walmart price.  I pod was given to 10 grand daughter and she loves it.
5	1326326400	I bought my gf the black one in-store but it got stolen, so I surprised her with this one for Christmas. She loved it so much, she couldn't stop thanking me. Her facial expression when it was delivered was priceless! On top of that, it was shipped and delivered on time.
5	1326326400	The Apple ipod touch 8GB 4th Generation. I purched for my daughter is amazing she playes it while she is playing with anything.While talking on the phone, using the computer,and even while we are playing Halo Reach. I don't see how she does it,But she just can't put it down.
5	1326326400	I bought my son an I-Touch last year and he uses it all the time. It is like having a mini laptop except Apple provides so many fun game apps, free or some cost, to download and keep them busy. They are great for long car rides. I bought my daughter this one for Christmas and copied all the downloads to hers and she loves it!
5	1326326400	I purchased one of these for each of my three sons.  The product is endlessly entertaining and capable.  I recommend this to anyone.
4	1326326400	this is my first ipod toutch i dont realy use apple products. i like all of the different apps u can get. i think u should be able to use more thing then itunes with out paying a monthly fee. i think you should include portible chargers in the package. all the cool kids have one and i think you should make more white ones so they are equel to the black.
5	1326326400	its beein doing its purpose so far and no problems....but its early to review for this kind of item since its only a month old ( i will update once i encounter something) - im giving it 6 mos....but its "Apple", you know...they are built good...also btw, the shipping is really fast....Thanks Amazon...
5	1326240000	This was purchased as a gift for my son for Christmas. My daughter had received one last year so I knew it was a good product. The 8gb is perfect for them. I would recommend this product.
4	1326240000	This is an easy product to by for your kid to use if he is just entering into the technical phase of his development.  My six year old wanted an ITouch and while I hesitated at first, he uses it for everything from taking pictures, to face timing his aunt uncle and myself, to listening to music, playing apps etc.  He also uses it to run his online store to sell cigars.  (Hey, I am just kidding about that, but I am sure he could if he wanted).  The only reason I give it a four star outcome is that it is a bit fragile for a young kid.  So you will need to invest in a case that is age appropriate if you would like to see your return on investment.
4	1326240000	We got each of our kids one for Christmas.  The device is a dream.  It has loads of features and a ton of apps (Although it isn't a phone if you are connected to WiFi it works like a phone and has it's own number.)I have two issues with it however.  The first is that before it can be used you MUST register it either via WiFi or thru itunes (we'll get to that in a moment). There is a catch here if you have a WiFi network chances are that it is -- or had better be -- a secure network.  One layer of security is to all your devices in a 'white list' on the WiFi AP (Access Point or router).  NOWHERE in/on the box/packaging is the MAC (Media Access Control) address which is encoded in the hardware and is unique to every single network device.  In order to get it you have to use itunes to register.  So in reality there is only one way to register your device, itunes.I have been involved with personal computers since before there was a PC or Macintosh, or even Apple Computers Inc was around, and one thing I have to admit in general from a purely user point of view software from Apple is easy to use and intuitive.  itunes however is NOT!  In order to use it you have to register and create an account.  Not usually a big deal but in this case you MUST provide credit card information!!!!!  (I know, I know that the idea is that you will need to pay for something & they want to make sure they get their money.  I have no problem with paying for a song or application -- let's give it it's proper name -- when, or if, I actually BUY something!!!)  Now that you have registered for itunes you can connect your device now itunes wants to 'sync' your ipod (that can take several minutes in general it took 15 min per device) and every time you want to add a song to your device it wants to 'sync' again.  You should be able to just drag-and-drop (isn't Apple the one who got the whole drag-and-drop thing going??!?!?!)In summary the ipod is a great little device, it has a plethora of great apps & songs you can get, still haven't figured how to get a video OFF the darn thing & the docs aren't much help, it takes great photos & videos.  Despise the REQUIREMENT to register prior to use and itunes needs to be reworked to be more intuitive.
5	1326153600	My husband absolutely loves it. It was a Christmas gift for him and he has not put it down. He loves everything about it. The apps the music and that he can get his emails and it works with our Mac. It was the best purchase we have made.
5	1326153600	IPod Touch 8GB 4th Generation is already an awesome product but backed up by Amazon's quick service and excellent support I belive this was a home run for my boys. I was trying to decide on ordering from MAc versus Amazon but I decided to go with Amazon and saved a little money and the product is awesome. It is like having and iphone and an Ipod because with the technology available they can use face time chat and send emails. 5 Stars!
4	1326153600	My wife & I each bought an iPod for our kids within minutes of each other.  We got a great deal and were very pleased with the price.  Both iPods were shipped to the same address via the same shipping method, but arrived 3 days apart.  Overall we were pleased, but the shipping of the products could have been more timely.
5	1326067200	as always apple will go beyond quality, I bought the ipod as a christmas gift for my wife and it is excelent very user friendly and as all apple products excellent quality, inmediatelly she connected to itune store and started downlowding all apple apps that she wanted
5	1326067200	The IPod Touch is a great product, very durable. The good price I got from Amazon made the purchase even better. I bought it in the white color which my son liked in order to keep his from getting mixed up with the usual black ones his friends have. I have always been greatly pleased with Amazon product and service but was somewhat purplexed as to why this product was not padded during shipment. It was simply thrown into the side of a box with another item I had purchased. Luckily no damage seems to have occured to the IPod.
5	1326067200	This was a Christmas present for my grandson and I was amazed at all the things it can do...It is so pretty too....so easy to load pictures on to Facebook, I was even able to do it. Very user friendly.
5	1326067200	My 10 yr old saved his money to buy this for himself and he loves it. I have had to call Apple's customer service tech support and they helped us with everything we have needed so far! We are very happy with the Ipod Touch. I hope my other son will be able to get one for himself as well. It's a great product. It's a little more difficult for me to figure out, but we haven't had any Apple products before. Great product!
4	1326067200	This item performs as specified. It is well liked. It was what she wanted for Christmas. I'm glad Santa could afford it because I sure couldn't.
5	1326067200	My oldest son got an iPod for Christmas leaving my younger son and I extremely jealous.  My husband and I have been contemplating another laptop, or tablet of some kind.  I can pick up wireless internet most anywhere.  If only I had wireless printer at home like I do at work I'd be set.  Great product delievered in just a couple days.  Thanks so much.
5	1326067200	Ordered 3 IPod Touches for our teeneage grandkids and they absolutely love them.  They do everything an IPhone does except make phone calls.  They can even video chat with each other and friends. Hardly saw them the rest of the holiday season cause they were so happy using their gift. Ordering from Amazon was so easy and they were delivered in a couple of days. Even got to use our American Express points so got 3 for the price of 2. Really great way to buy.  Thank you, Amazon.
5	1326067200	Love it! i got it for my boyfriend, he lives in Mexico and we can talk for hours without pay anything!! we just need wi fii and that's it, pretty much the ipod touch and the iphone works the same :) so if you dont want to get enroll in a 2 years contract , and ipod touch its your best option
5	1326067200	Had great experience ordering the product on-line and with Amazon. The product was packaged well and came on time! I LOVE iPod s and this is my third:) My only complaint about this product would be that Apple take up too much space on the iPod with their own crap you can't delete and you only get like 6GB of memory from an 8GB iPod! If you plan on putting a lot of stuff on it get a 32GB! BRING BACK THE 16GB AS WELL!
5	1325980800	Going on 2 yrs and still going strong! My son loves it. He uses it every day. He even had something spilled on it in December and it was still covered under warranty and they replaced it. Thank goodness he had all his info backed up on the home PC.
5	1325980800	best thing ever you should get one they are excellent i have and mine is awesome the 8gig is the best i think because cost less and that is really all the room you need
5	1325980800	Couldn't beat the convenience and price.  It was exactly as stated and arrived quickly. Felt good to not have to stand in crazy lines and still get an awesome deal. Thanks!
5	1325980800	Great product. Works perfectly well. Received on time in original package. I installed wi fi internet at home when I got this iPod and since then I almost stopped using my computer... works fantastic for most simple internet needs, facebook, mail, music, etc. Definitely recommend!
4	1325980800	The Ipod arrived when promised and in good condition. The price was the best I'd seen up to the point I bought it although, I found it a few dollars cheaper at Best Buy.com, although I had to pay sales tax there which raised the price above Amazon's.The kids love the Ipod and haven't yet begun to push its limits. Maybe I should've bought one for myself! Hmmm...
5	1325980800	This purchase sure made one little childs Christmas very special...and after talking to the Mom...she was pretty happy too! Great for quiet time!
4	1325980800	The only problem I have is that it is too easy to break the screen. It took my daughter less than a week.
5	1325980800	Teenager love it of course. Takes pictures, videos, holds 1000+ songs. Also used for texting and video chat with out of state friends. Works well, no problems so far. Also holds plenty of game apps.
5	1325980800	What can be said for the marvel that this item is. Bought as a Christmas gift, this purchase is a winner. It is essentially a full blown computer in the palm of your hand. Hat's off to Steve Jobs (RIP) a true genius in our lifetime. This product can do everything my computer can do. Great gift and great product! Would, have, and did buy again and again. Highest Recommendation!!!
5	1325894400	After purchasing an iPod from Amazon for my daughter as a gift for Christmas.  She showed me 'all' the things you can do with this.  So, I just had to have one for myself ;)  We bought 2 of these & LOVE them!!  THANK YOU Amazon....your the Best!!
5	1325894400	Once again another Apple product that I am very satisfied with.  This iPod touch is very easy to use and has plenty of space for my youngest daughter.  While this iPod touch is a little expensive compared to other 8GB MP3 players, I believe it is well worth the price.  It is very easy to navigate and operate.  Downloads are easy and quick.  I did have a bit of difficulty when I first went to load music on it, but once I figured out what I was doing, it was a piece of cake.  The sound quality is great and the video quality is excellent.  I would definitely recommend an iPod touch to anyone looking to purchase an MP3 player.
1	1325894400	This product is everything it says it is, however, Amazon is not.  I ordered the IPod from Amazon as a birthday gift for my son.  When I bought it, which was 10 days before his birthday, Amazon indicated that the expected date of delivery was 2 days prior to his birthday.  When the IPod had not been delivered the day before his birthday, I called Amazon to find out where it was.  I spoke to 3 different individuals at Amazon.  After an hour and a half on the phone, I finally spoke to someone who transferred me to the shipping company.  Apparently the IPod is considered a "smart phone" and is subject to special shipping procedures.The shipping company told me that even though Amazon had electronically delivered the item to hem for shipping, it had not physically given the item to them yet.  Consequently, there was zero chance that I would receive the IPod on the listed expected date of delivery or with a week of my son's birthday.30 minutes later I was able to get to a supervisor at Amazon and cancel the order.  Amazon didn't want to cancel the order claiming that the IPod was already in shipment.  They wanted me to reject the item when it actually showed up at my house, but again couldn't tell me when that would be.  I told them I would not be home, would not accept the item, would not reject the item and would not take responsibility for anything that happened to it.  Apparently, that changed their mind as it never arrived at my house.  Nonetheless, I am still getting emails asking me to write reviews on a product that Amazon never delivered to me.  So here is my review.  Amazon failed to deliver and their customer service has been horrible.  I would not purchase this item again from Amazon and I'm reluctant to purchase anything else from them at this point.I picked up the IPod on my son's birthday from Target.  It cost $10 more than the price on Amazon, but I had it when I needed it and the customer service was well worth the money.  My son loves it and hasn't put it down since he opened the box.
5	1325894400	I got an I-pod touch for my son for Christmas, and we are very happy with our purchase! We got it right on time and the price was unmatched!!!
5	1325894400	Actual rating: 4.5 stars.The new iPod touch holds many improvements over the 3rd gen. It has a new camera, it comes in white, it's thinner, and the glass display has been enhanced with Retina Display. I have been very happy with it so far, but I noticed there are a few flaws about it.Pros:1. All the apps...there are so many good games and other apps!2. The Retina Display...it is the most clear screen on an iPod, or any MP3 player out there. It's bright and vibrant. There is no chance any competitor will beat it.3. The design is a pro and a con; see the bad part about it below in cons. It looks slick and stellar, and is a brilliant fashion statement. I bought the white one, and people always comment on how sharp it looks.4. iOS 5: The operating system is amazing. It is easy to use, it holds thousands of apps and music in the iTunes and App stores, and best of all, you don't need to tether it to a computer to own it!5. The camera. I think it is, like the design, a pro and a con. It looks nice and high-end, and it takes HD video which is nice, but see below for the cons about it.6. The search feature really helps with finding things buried in the operating system. With 32 gigs, you can easily forget about an app in a large folder or a song in a large playlist, which is where search comes in to help.7. FaceTime actually works, and it's way better than Skype. The picture is so much clearer, and it has less lag.Cons:1. The design. As I stated above, it's a pro and a con. It looks nice, but don't expect the mirror back to last a week without getting a scratch or scuff on it, even if it's in a case.2. The camera. Once again, it's a pro and a con. It's nice to have if you need to take a quick picture and you don't have a real camera with you, but the pictures are grainy and low quality, especially in medium to low light. The HD video is actually pretty good, though.3. The screen is way too glossy. There is so much glare that if you are trying to use it outside in the sunlight, you can barely see what's on the screen. The screen is also fragile. Most of the people walking around my school that have this iPod are using it with a shattered display. I didn't want that to happen, so I bought a case for it. A solution for the reflective screen: get a matte screen protector. I bought the Halo matte screen protector here on Amazon really cheap, and I am very happy with it.Summary: I am very satisfied with the iPod. It surpassed my expectations, I love the color (white), iOS 5 is flawless, and it looks magnificent. It is a bit overpriced, I paid $322.17 for it at the Apple store including tax, but in the long run I'm sure it will be worth it. I would recommend this iPod to anyone looking to buy a new high-end MP3 player.
5	1325894400	This is an amazing product.  My daughter loves it I give it 5 stars.  If she is happy so are we. The product was delivered on time.
5	1325894400	I could`nt be happier with my ipod i got for Christmas, if i had known they were like this i would have had one a lot sooner , it is like haveing a computer the size of a cell phone , so convenient and easy to use . great price at amazon,and fast shipping.
4	1325894400	Was as advertised. Fast shipping. Would buy from again. Only down side didn't come with a wall charger only way to charge it is with computer.
4	1325894400	Let me be brief on this reviewPros:-Great Display-Overall nice speeds-Very versatile-Great battery life-32gb provides enough memory for all my music,videos etc (This may not be the cased for everyone so be warned)-Mostly great apps-Nice new features thanks to iOS 5-Quality in total is great-Very portable and fits easily in your pocketCons:-Terrible rear camera and front camera(it's the same as the iPhone 4), especially photos, decent video recording though(I'm thinking Apple will more than likely improve the camera in future generations, I'm not asking for an iPhone 4s type camera, but at least 5 or 6 megapixels, I mean this iPod has less than 1 megapixel, come on Apple you can do way better!!!!)-No flash for photos-The mic is decent but often has issues(at least for me that is)-No built in real radio(but there are apps that use wifi and give you radio)-Very easily scratch-able back(a case can usually get rid of this issue)-Speaker is not too loud, hopefully they'll improve it.-I know some people hate hearing about it but, NO FLASH PLAYER!! (it's not that big of an issue and I understand why apple doesn't have it but they should at least let us choose if we want it or not)-Sometimes the iPod will have heat issues, this doesn't happen to mine but be warned yours might have this problem-Lastly, this is an issue for many people; the price. For what you pay you'll defiantly get a great device, but for many $300 is just too much, which is why Amazon should be your place to buy the iPod Touch for a nice discount.I love my iPod Touch, it's a wonderful device and honestly with a few improvements and additions, it would be a perfect device(well for me anyway). I'll be waiting for the iPod Touch 5th Generation generally, I'm confident this device will satisfy you as well. However you may want to wait for later on in the year to go on and buy the 5th Gen instead of this one. Anyway I recommend this product, especially for any teens out there. This is the way to go if you don't want to pay monthly for an iPhone but still want a name brand device. Apple has really won me over with the iPod Touch and I'm sure they'll continue to do so with future generations.
5	1325894400	I didn't want to buy a smart phone but wanted the ability to use apps and wifi connectivity to itunes. Works like a charm. Love love love it!
5	1325894400	this product is truly amazing-our grandson is the recipient of the ipad-and he just loves it-we really had to shop around to fine a white one,and amazon was the only place we found it - and it was less expensive than the prices that other stores wanted.  We are firm believers in Amazon- thanks for all the good work- Ed and Becki K.
5	1325894400	I hate to say I love this stupid little device. I got it for my wife who is not very computer savvy, and I was kind of in awe of all the things it did I thought only a smart phone could do.I'm not a convert, but this is undeniably a great product. Most important of all, my wife absolutely loves it!
4	1325894400	I got this for my husband and daughter for Christmas. Now I don't have to fight over MY ipad. Most of the apps that I had for my Ipad will also work on the IPod Touch. It is also compact and great for travel. I give it only have 4 stars because the keyboard on the screen is to small. The sound on it is well.
5	1325894400	daughter loves it  arrived within two days no problems  easy purchase  will use again.  product has many uses  what else can I say
4	1325894400	excellent product, was very good purchase, the product is very good! I now have so much fun with my mp3, I like very much!
4	1325808000	As someone new to Apple products I have to say it was a pain to get this thing up and running.  Not at all user friendly set up.  But once we finally figured all of that out it is great.
5	1325808000	Excellent product.  Excellent service.  Timely delivery.  We are very happy with the total experience of this purchase.  I would highly recommend it.
5	1325808000	i'm IN LOVE with my new 4th gen ipod touch! i've wanted to upgrade my cell phone to the iphone for a while, but i just can't justify spending an extra $30/month on a data plan when i don't truly need it. this is why i decided to buy myself an ipod touch. i can take it anywhere with me & get online wherever wifi is available, & i can also play games or listen to music whenever i want. i got the 8gb version & it's plenty of space for me. amazon.com is awesome! this was one of very few places that had the white color in-stock & i saved money by ordering here instead of through the apple store. plus shipping was free & i received my brand new ipod less than 48hrs after i ordered it! do not hesitate if you're thinking about ordering one too :)
5	1325808000	My son was so happy with his Christmas gift, Awsome price Awesome shipping... Love Amazon!!!! Anytime I need a gift, will turn to them. And was so glad my boss gave me my gift in Amazon gift card.
5	1325808000	Great product no problems at all.  Ipod is apple's greatest hit. Will definitley buy more ipods. Daniel my brother loves his ipod too. Too many words in this crap.
5	1325808000	This Ipod was a gift for my son and he is very happy with this toy. He installed his music from the computer and now he can take it with him.
4	1325721600	Great little gadget to have. The only downside is sometimes it isn't obvious when it turns off, and if it isn't properly turned off the battery dies.
5	1325721600	I have the 32 GB and bought 2 of these for my 14 year old grandkids. They love them. They're on it for hours and I could not have given them a better gift. They love the APPS espically Tango and Facetime because they live far away and we get to keep in touch.
4	1325721600	The iPod touch does what it says on the box. It is user friendly and is already much loved by the recipients.The only downsides are its size (small and thin so can easily be lost), fragility (needs protective screen and case - should come as standard) and addictiveness, but these are all known quantities when we bought it so not a fault of the item - just something to consider.
5	1325721600	It's super fast and HD. I love it so much. I obsess over it so much. My friends play with it but I get really protective. It's just really amazing, you should totally get this :)
5	1325721600	First of all, I love apple products. So of course this is no exception. This was a gift for my 4-year old and he loves it. So many different learning apps and games he is able to play for a very minimal or no fee at all. Apple products are simply the best!
1	1325721600	I bought the Ipod touch for my 7 year old daughter and she loves it. It's simple enough for her to manage and use alone. The camera takes beautiful clear pictures.
4	1325721600	This item arrived a couple of days late but in great conditions. I just wish it would arrived on time.
5	1325635200	What can you say about the itouch.  I bought this for my son and he uses it every day.  The itouch is easy to use and it has a wide range of uses. Music, texting (if you have wifi and text another apple product),movies, games etc. Great product.
5	1325635200	Bought this for my niece and she loves it, now I get a chance to facetime her from NY to LV, apple always makes a good product!
5	1325635200	Excelente product, excelent seller. And i had any problems with the ship. Very trustly. I recomend the product and the seller,
5	1325635200	The iPod Touch maybe the last great MP3 player standing.  With iPhones and Android phones becoming the primary mp3 player for many users, mp3 players are simply dieing out.  Well the iPod Touch is the last hold out.  And with the high resolution screen, thinness, graphics, and now available in white it is the best MP3 player out there.  The main reason to get this over a phone is that you don't have to pay monthly fees.
5	1325635200	I bought this Ipod touch for my son--( don't tell him that,>&lt; Santa sometimes needs a little help.) It is perfect.  It was very easy to set up and use.  My son no longer is bugging me to use my phone to play games.  I love the fact that everytime he want to download an app or game - it asks for my password as well as sends me an email to make sure I made a purchase.  I do not have crazy fees or unapproved downloads.
5	1325635200	This little dynamo is just like the iPhone sans the phone call capability. Like a mini computer. Great for the kids too. Have tons of apps for math and reading.
5	1325635200	I bought this item for a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and she is absolutely in love with it. I would reccommend it to anyone looking to buy someone a gift or if they are interested in one themselves.
5	1325635200	This ipod touch is perfect for our wireless service!  Anything is accessed on the 'net ....at your fingers!  Highly recommended over buying a laptop.  We also heard that the iPAD is a waste of time.
5	1325635200	We bought the Apple ipod touch for our 14 year old son.  He loves it!  this is his first ipod and it does so  much.  I was looking at it and was so amazed at all the differant things it can do.  He was so excited about getting one, he takes it with him everywhere.  This was a great purchase.  We recieved when they said we would.  I highly recommend this for anyone interseted in an ipod,Apple iPod touch 8GB (4th Generation) - Black - Current Version
5	1325635200	Great product , very little weight ,  sound quality is good and the touch screen has very good resolution and it is very responsive .  For me the most important thing :  my daughter is trilled with it.
1	1325548800	My iPod Touch Gen4 (a free gift from KeyBank) just died on my kid's hand while playing game, with absolutely no dropping/water/anything suspecious. I was hoping at least the iPod would outlast its battery which I cannot replace.It has been a good entertainer for my kids (4 and 7) before they got the Nintendo 3DS, after which neither barely touch the iPod. During one of the holiday night gatherings we had a bunch of kids around, each was playing a toy. My 4yr old was playing the iPod Touch with another kid (extremely peacefully). It was just fully charged and has 80+% battery left. With no sign, no dropping, no water, no nothing - it just died on the kids, and would never respond to recharge/home button/anything.Enough about Made-by-Apple quality.
5	1325548800	I have tried several ipad and ipod clones and none that i have tried compare to the Apple ipod 4th generation, absolutely the best of the best!
5	1325548800	I made a wise choice for a Christmas Present! It was quite a surprise and he luvs it!!! Best present under the tree!
5	1325548800	The ipod was purchased for my grand daughter as a Christmas gift, she has not put in down since. I was amazed at all the functions on this unit.Thank you for the quick service.
5	1325548800	I bought these for my daughters for Christmas- ages 10 and 13.  They LOVE them, they carry them everywhere.  They have had no problems whatsoever with them!  Great price also!
3	1325548800	I bought two iPod Touches for my girls for Christmas.  I already had around 650 songs in iTunes from over the years.  I went to download them all onto thier iPods before putting them under the tree.  Those 650 songs filled up their iPods.  They are normal, everyday size songs.  A few were a little long but most weren't.  The 8 GB iPod touch says it holds between 1,500 and 2,000 songs.  I had to delete songs on their iPod Touch in order to put new songs on from the top 40 that they wanted from the iTunes store.  If I had known this, I would have bought the next size up iPod Touch.  There was nothing on their iPod Touch, only what it came with so it's not filled up with other apps, pictures, etc.  So just take that into consideration before buying the 8 GB one.
5	1325548800	I got this as a late christmas gift, everything was amazing! the camera tok great quality pictures and it kept me entertained for hours! Unfortunately, it got stolen 4 days after i got it, but i'm getting another one so it's all good :D
5	1325548800	Bought this for my 11 year old.  She just loves it.  Does so much more than just pay music.  She was texting, taking pictures and emailing them all within the first hour of getting the iPod.  Easy to use.  Would recommend for anyone.
4	1325548800	Of course, Apple makes outstanding products and this one is also. We bought this for our twin girls for Christmas and they love the camera/video feature which is the only thing they can do at this point because we can't get an Apple ID for them. My husband has logged in on two different computers to no avail. He keeps getting a message that he's "suspicious." And when I called to try and work this out with someone, I received an automated message that sent me to their customer service which was busy and then I tried 3 other times and was connected to another customer service area that didn't answer. I can't even call a store directly, ugh. So...I rated it a 4 star because of the customer service issue, if we ever get an id, I'm sure it will be worth it!
5	1325548800	New in box and in great condition. Exactly like what you would get at your local box store but less $$. Thank you
5	1325462400	Bought for my ten yr old daughter.  She loves it.  Love the white option.  Can easily tell it apart from her brother's iPod.
5	1325462400	Bought is for my Daughters Christmas gift and she loves it!!  I am a regular shopper of Amazon.comI recommend this site to others.
1	1325462400	Have not got it so I dont know..It said it was delievered I have got my cover and all for it and the other stuff i ordered for it , can u do a track or sumthing and see where it is and when it might be here its a late Christmas present for my daughter and she really wants it....Thanks alotMisty
5	1325462400	Buying from Amazon.com was a great experience.  I purchased this item and it was lost in the mail, Amazon shipped another item out and I received it the next day.This was my Daughters favorite Christmas present.  She has had a great time playing games and texting.  What a great buy.
5	1325462400	It is a I Pod touch like it says. A lot less expensive than if ordering from Apple web site.
5	1325462400	I received this as a New Year's/Early birthday gift! I LOVE it!  It is easy to use, has a great battery life, and works really fast!
5	1325462400	Excelente producto y una compra 100% segura el vendedor entrego en el tiempo correcto lo recomiendo se puede bajar juegos musicas, recibo mi correo y otras cosas que aun estoy explorando
5	1325462400	We bought this iPod for our daughter-in-law for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.  She can do so many things with it.  She stays connected with her email, downloads music and other things, knows what the weather is at a glance, uses the notebook and so many more functions too numerous to mention. She also plays the music through her docking system. We highly recommend this iPod touch.
5	1325462400	This gadget is wonderful!  It is going to knock a big hole in computer sales!  Everything you need to do can be done here...except setting up my google profile it said I neeeded to use the desk top.  A+++++++++++++++++++!
5	1325462400	NEVER HAD ONE, AND THIS ONE IT'S SO COOL AND SLEEK. SO MODERN AND HANDY, ADICTIVE TO HAVE AT ALL TIMES EVEN WHEN YOU WORK.
1	1325462400	The Item is broken.  The "touch glass" is smashed.  We are very upset and very disappointed.  I've never had this bad a product from Amazon before.  Going nuts trying to find information on what we are supposed to do under theses circumstances.  Since I got this "review request" in my email, I decided to let you know via this way, and hope you'll contact us to let us know what recourse we have.I would rather have given 0 Stars or negative stars, but the program will not allow it.
5	1325462400	This ipod touch is the best,its basically an iphone.I love it,love the touchscreen keyboard,the thin and sleek design. Its perfection
5	1325462400	It's an iPod...What more can I say?  Looks great, plays great, and my daughter loves the white that none of her friends have. :-)
5	1325376000	Great product!  Arrived quickly. Worked flawlessly! These are top notch highly sought products products in white! Highly recommend to anyone!
5	1325376000	So I received this as a gift. Being a PC guy I had been holding out against any Apple products. After playing around with the ipod touch I may have been converted!It's a cool sleek product, works easily, no drivers to load and complex configuration. I was online in 5 minutes from opening the packet and setting up my account.For it's primary development history of being a music player it's fantastic but too large for me to run on the treadmill with - it's size is just right as a mobile personal information device to surf the net, keep my contact book, play games, keep my calendar and use a variety of apps.A few personal highlights for me that were really cool was the ability to completely control my roku soundbridge devices with a $2.99 app which has brought new life to streaming my music to my old devices. Also facetime is out of this world as far as the easy to use with another ipod/iphone (and using skype or tango for other devices) - was able to have a 2 hour video conversation with my sis in the UK - for free!!!Messenger was also wonderful. I suppose since so many people seem to have a mobile Apple product it really works well. I am impressed. If this is how Apple products are I may get a Mac as my next computer!
5	1325376000	I ordered this iPod as a gift for my son.  It arrived promptly (2 days before amazon said it would).  It has been used constantly in the week since Christmas and is working great!  He loves it!
5	1325376000	The amount of things that can be done with the iPod touch is far greater than a regular iPod.  Love the email capabilities, texting, camera, facetime and multiple apts.  We love that we get to play games with family and friends across the country.
5	1325376000	I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas.  I have learned a lot of options it has that I didn't know about..... might get myself one next month. Item works well and haven't had any problems.
5	1325376000	I lost my 3rd generation iPod touch about one year ago and I felt very bad for a long time, as I do use my iPod everyday.Recently I bought the 4th generation iPod touch as a Christmas gift for myself, although i thought about getting a iPhone.I opted for an iPod touch because:1) I have wifi at work and home, I use Skype app on my iPod touch to make most calls, I do have a T-mobile prepaid feature phone to receive calls.As I don't have many incoming calls, it saves a lot of money in the long run.2)I use my iPod touch mainly for music and podcast from NPR, and it is more than capable of doing that.Though iPhone is good for going out where there is no wifi, I just do not find myself need it that often to justify the cost.Still very happy with my iPod as always.
5	1325376000	I purchased this for my sons birthday.  He loves to face time his friends, play the apps and listen to music.  The 8gb has been enough for him because he does not download movies and we also monotor what he does on it and out time limits as well.  Amazon had it at a decent price.
5	1325376000	It's my precious, It's a thing of beauty.I love its glossy screen and shiny icons, It makes life so much easier now that i have it i find i dont use my laptop as much anymore as the ipod touch can do pretty much everything a laptop can, checking emails is great and having everything backed automatically to the included free icloud account the 8gb space is plenty enough for all my music and apps.I love you, My precious ipod.
5	1325376000	THIS LITTLE MP3 PLAYER IS GREAT FOR MY GRAND CHILDREN THEY LOVE IT FOR MUSIC TEXTING (WHICH IS ALL THEY DO) AND WI-FI GAMES.Apple iPod touch 8GB (4th Generation) - Black - Current Version
1	1325376000	well what is there to say about this itouch if i havent got it. this is BS cause i even payed over night shpping n i hsd been outside all day waiting gor my package that never  came
5	1325376000	My son love this Ipod touch! It was super slim and so clear and crisp. buy this product you wont be dissapointed!
5	1325289600	Bought from Amazon because I trust their return policy over Apple.  Daughter loves it as it was an upgrade from a lower version.
4	1325289600	fast ship and good conditions; its used and is fine. only the price for a used ipod touch is the same to new and this is a little hard to pay.
5	1325289600	This product is so nice and just right to its price!I have made my homework before buying this product and I found it best to buy at Amazon.com.
5	1325289600	Purchased the iPod from Amazon as a Christmas gift for my son. He is still happy as can be about the whole thing. Received promptly, and package appropriately, which is always the way with Amazon. Apple has a reputation for high quality products and after having gotten this one up and running for my kid, installed his music on it, and toyed with it a little, I can say that it seems very well constructed. Both hardware and software are top notch.
4	1325289600	real entertainment for anyone, you can do tons of stuff to keep yourself busy. Tons of free games available on line, so you never have to worry about being bored.
4	1325289600	This product arrived on time and was very well protected. The instructions for starting up the iPod was clear the only problem we had was that the latest version of iTunes was necessary, so be warned.  My son has only tapped into some of the applications since Christmas but let me tell you this is a great product, there is even an app for a cell phone.
5	1325289600	i ordered this with no problem and recieved it in a timely manner right before christmas and was amazed there was no glitches.  quality was as expected from ipod and am enjoying it immensely. would highly recommend the product and ordering from amazon.
5	1325203200	I absolutely love this Ipod. It is very durable and easy to use. It has amazing graphics and apps available for it!
5	1325203200	The iPod touche 8 GB 4th Generation is great, you can do everything with it, read books, listen to music, watch TV, it is just a great gift or something for yourself.
5	1325203200	My son received this as a Christmas present. Worked perfectly from day one. We had no problems at all. Would recommend.
5	1325203200	I surprised my wife with a 4th generation 8GB iPod touch for Christmas, and she has been very happy with the gift. Sweet. I looked into an iPad and iPhone, but they're currently out of our price league. When I mentioned to my wife about getting her an iPod touch, she did not like the idea of carrying both her cell phone and an iPod touch, but this has not been an issue at all. She had been expressing interest in a Kindle, but I felt the device would not get used as much as an iPod touch.The iPod touch does everything my school-provided iPhone 4 does except it does not contain some of the major call and internet features. You can't go online anywhere, but as long as you are in a Wi-fi network (homes, hotels, schools, libraries, coffee houses, etc.), you can surf the Web, send and receive emails, navigate Maps, and more. Although the iPod touch is not a phone, that does not mean you can't call people. You can call people through applications such as FaceTime and Skype. You can also send unlimited text messages for free to any iOS device.My wife has been using her iPod touch for a number of reasons. This includes daily reading, studying Chinese (we live in China), and playing fun and educational games with our girls. One of the things I think she likes the most about the iPod touch is being introduced to the App Store. I have enjoyed watching (and benefiting from) her finding new cooking and financial planning apps. In the future I see my wife taking pictures and video taping school events, syncing her iCal (endar), listening to NPR, and downloading cartoons for our girls.The iPod touch can be used right from the box. I was initially surprised at how much thinner and lighter the iPod touch is compared to iPhone. Your iPod touch will contain headphones and a small manual that you probably don't need to look at. I recommend purchasing some kind of case and screen sticker to help protect your expensive purchase. This is another great product from the people of Apple.
5	1325203200	Product was new as promised. Also the shipment came in blowing like the wind super fast. I would most definitely purchase from here again. Amazon even called my mother personally to make sure the purchase was made by her &  was supposed to ship to a different address other than the billing address.
5	1325203200	I got this ipod touch for my daughter and she was excited to have it. It came to us on time, without any issues and was intact upon arrival. She loves it, she texts,emails listens to music, and surf the web she said it is better than her smart phone. It was the cheapest online price for the white ipod touch 4g. Thank you amazon it made my daughter's Christmas I recommend it
5	1325203200	This was a Christmas present.  The recipient loves it.  It arrived from Amazon.com on time just as advertised.  Setup was easy and connection to a wireless network was flawless.
5	1325203200	Held off getting this for 2 years for my girls.  Bought one for them to share and had to order another one immediately.  Both of them love it (ages 13 and 8).
5	1325203200	This was shipped very fast.  I got this product in less than a week. It works great and my grand daughter was thrilled!
5	1325203200	Was impressed in quick turn around time for this product.  It came sooner than I expected !  It works perfectly & thrilled my son when he opened it on Christmas.  Was the best price I found ANYWHERE for a new iPod touch of that size.  Am very happy with the service & quality of product -- I will definitely use this site for future purchases !!
5	1325203200	I'm very impressed with this product. I had the previous version an decided to try the whe white one whic I have fell in love with. The camera could be better. Shipping was not a haste at all.
5	1325203200	This is exactly what my grandchild wanted.  It does everything it said it would... Amazon is the best. I always shop at Amazon.
5	1325203200	I love my iPod Touch! I have most of my music on here and I also invested in a few apps. Connected to a network with Wi-Fi, downloading is fast! Awesome!
5	1325203200	This has met all my expectations.  This was a gift for my 11 year old daughter. I have an iPhone and she loves that she can text me while I'm at work now. It is pretty amazing. She wanted the 3DS, but games are so expensive and with the iPod Touch, she has all kinds of free games and a few I paid for, but the most expensive has been $2.99.  Highly recommended for the hard to buy for pre teen.
5	1325203200	This is a great product! It is ageless and perfect for any occasion. I highly recommend it for everyone in need of a gift.
5	1325203200	Wonderful product, my husband was so excited he couldn't put it down. I couldn't be more pleased. The service was excellent. Thankyou Amazon.
5	1325203200	This IPOD rocks. It is the best small handheld device ever. Amazon sells products at amazing prices. I would buy one of these again.
5	1325203200	Great so far. Very good quality and function as you would expect with an Apple product. My daughter is enjoying the games and music.
5	1325203200	I bought the Apple Ipod for my twelve year old nephew. It has been in his hands since he received it . He loves it.He also got Itunes card which allows him t have phone service. He really loves that. I would recommend purchase.
5	1325203200	This Ipod touch is pleasing to the eye and mind.  My daughter loves it but boy, it sure can fill up space quite quickly.  Now I want one but I plan to purchase more gb's on mine.
5	1325203200	Ipods are very good to have around, it's like having a mini computer. We love ours!You can listen to music, check e-mail, watch videos, get on FaceBook, play games. Very useful little thing!
5	1325203200	Cheaper than at the store.  My brother loved this for xmas. Came brand new in box just like from beat buy buy less. Eight gigs was plenty for him. Fits all his music and pics.
4	1325203200	This iPod is a good product.  The camera is pretty good.  It is easy to use.  The battery isn't as good as I thought it would be, so if that is the only reason you are getting it (for a better battery) just keep your old one.  This product was shipped in a timely manner.
5	1325203200	This was a gift for my son from Santa and he has played with it since Christmas morning.  He has downloaded games and music and books.  He loves being able to take pictures and text me as well.  I recommend you get a case for it.  LOVE that Santa picked such a perfect gift ;)
5	1325203200	This is the 6th iPod touch I have purchased for myself or family members and they are still simply the best. My daughter wanted a white one for Christmas so we picked this one up for her here at Amazon, (along with the rest of my shopping list.)These keep getting better and better and offer more features and bang for the buck. I also want to say that every one of our iPod's are still purring along and we haven't had one go bad on us yet.So if you want an MP3 player that does a zillion other things, this is what you want. If you are after something for primarily music I would suggest the nano instead.
5	1325203200	I love my iPod Touch and use it daily, and not even using it to play MP3s.  It's a great PDA that does almost everything an iPhone does, without the phone.  There are countless great and free apps you can download from iTunes.  It's rock solid, very well built, and has great battery life.  The screen is fantastic too, bright and shape.  I would highly recommend getting the iPod Touch over any other personal media player using Android.
5	1325203200	My 4th generation itouch is a great purchase. I received it on time. This would be one of my first purchases with amazon. I had great service.
5	1325203200	The I-Pod Touch was a Christmas gift for our granddaughter, McKinley, who lives in Pennsylvania.  She absolutely loved it!  She called us the moment she opened it.
2	1325203200	It maybe great but the only instuctions that came with it was a short quick start guide. I would have liked  some kind of programing guide. Maybe I will like it better when I figure it out.
5	1325116800	This iPod is so cool you just have to make sure to check if you are acually connected to the internet with a 192 number in the wifi but if it has a 162 number it is not connected and you need a different wifi.  Also make sure facetime works or you can return it or deal with it.
1	1325116800	Looks like with over 380 reviews of 3 stars or less I will run from this purchase, I am more than surprised about this...!!!
5	1325116800	Received my IPod Touch quicker than expected. It was very user friendly and easy to set up. Face time is a great way to keep in touch with grandchildren.
5	1325116800	I was a littel scared to buy such an expensive gift online but no problems here.I recd a brand new unopened ipod for my son.-great price-excellent condition-works just like it should-would recommend this buyer to anyone
5	1325116800	What can you say about the ipod touch that hasn't already been said? Great little device! Wish I'd got the 16gb or bigger 8gb is ok but once you put some apps on it and a few pics you've already used up quite a bit of storage space. As always shipping was fast and free.
3	1325116800	I bought this on Black Friday, along with an iPod-2.  I have an iPhone-4, which I've been happy with.  I noticed the iPod Touch wasn't as fast as the iPhone, which was surprising since I thought they would have the same technology.  Then, on Christmas, I took a picture with my iPad.  The picture quality was...blah.  After reading that the iPad doesn't have a good quality camera (something like a 0.7MP) I noticed the iPhone was a 5MP...much better.  Thinking again the iPod Touch was iPhone-like, I took a picture with it, only to find it had the same camera quality as the iPad.If I could, I'd just get another iPhone without the 3G service and not buy an iPod.  The iPad I like - it seems pretty fast and I don't plan to use it for pictures, so, I'm okay with it it.Overall..I'm disappointed with Apple.  They should not release these types of products - sub-standard in today's world.
5	1325116800	This IPod is amazing ! It delivers what it promises in a lightweight design that aims to please and ease of use had me using it like a pro in no times! I love how it combines all my favorite pass times together where I can check my e-mail  .. write text messages or share a picture (or video) on facebook all in one efficient .. organized unit in lightening speed fashion.!
5	1325116800	Ive heard a lot of the screen breaking really easily. Well as long as your CAREFUL with it there is NO problem. Who knew it. Anyway, the camera on it is actually very good, front and back. It is much faster than the older models as well. Weight and size are about the same. But for the same amount of money you can, Like I did for myself, go out and buy a Kindle Fire which I think is much much better and can do much more, May not have cameras but thats about the only thing the iPod has on it.
5	1325116800	I bought this for my son and he absolutetly loves it!  I received this item within 1 week of ordering it.  Works great!
5	1325116800	Purchased these for all our remote close family members this Christmas and it's been so wonderful to be able to call them with FaceTime at any moment and see them.Of course that just scratches the surface of the iPod Touch. It's basically an iPhone 4 without the phone. I've since upgraded to an iPhone 4S and it would be cool if the Touch has things like Siri, or even a better rear camera, but you can't really ask for much more in such a small package.
5	1325116800	The iPod arrived within reasonable time and was in perfect condition upon arrival. I'm very pleased with it. Will do business again.
5	1325030400	I am a 58 year old man, and am somewhat computer literate. This product is very easy to operate....Makes me wish I had started with a Mac instead of a PC. I personally like the small screen, as opposed to the iPads and the different tablets being sold today. 8gb seems to be enough for my use....but I would consider the 32gb or the 64gb if you would be playing a lot of games, loading a lot of pictures, or like to listen to many different kinds of music....You might run short of space. This is a great tool or toy, depending on your use of it. But then again, I am easily amused!
5	1325030400	great product , almost like a computer or phone, great features, i would recomend to anyone,love the featuresi pods rock the world,
5	1325030400	i think they was so cool i bought two of them and gave them to my kids they havent put them down yet..
5	1325030400	I BOUGHT THIS I- TOUCH AND IT WAS INTOUCH BRAND NEW. AND WE ARE VERY PLEASE WITH IT. I WOULD BUY MORE STUFF FROM HERE. TKS!!!!
5	1325030400	Packaged well.  Everything needed in box.  Worked well as expected, arrived when informed it would.  Great price, would buy from electronic department again.
5	1324944000	THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. IT HAS ENOUGH CAPACITY TO HOLD MY FAVORITE MUSIC AND PHOTOS. ONLINE USAGE LIMITED BY SCREEN SIZE BUT BETTER THAN EXPECTED.
5	1324944000	Bought this for my 6 year old and she was so happy!!  It works perfect for her.  She can play her games and take pictures and video.  She loves that she can just push a button and see herself to take a picture. Received it very quickly!
5	1324944000	This is a great little mini computer.  It's very simple to figure out and I can take it with me everywhere I go.  I can have my music which is in sync with my home computer.  I can check my Facebook, email, read, Skype and so much more on this little device with local wi-fi.  This is a great little product and I'm so glad I gave it a try.  Service with Amazon was quick as usual.  I have no complaints so far but have only had it for a month now.  Apple makes some very amazing products.  This year is my my first experience with Apple and I'm so grateful for the switch from PC to Apple.  Great products.  Don't think you'll be disappointed.
5	1324944000	When i ordered my ipod touch it was sopose to come used but when it came in the mail it was brand new and it only cost me a little over $100.
5	1324944000	got this for my son for Christmas, he loves it.  Works great, shipped fast and great price.  Would suggest this item to a friend.
5	1324944000	Great product.  Good Price.  I use it everyday.  I would review more products if i didn't have a word requirement
5	1324944000	My son loves it, it has not left his side since he unwrapped it. It was cheaper on Amazon than on the Apple web site and arrived quickly with no shipping charges. I couldn't be happier with the service or product. It does everything!
5	1324944000	It was a Christmas present so really don't know how it works. Very nice. It was Packaged great and arrived quickly.
5	1324944000	the iPod are in perfect condition without any problem, very lindoel product in the white light and easy to use many applications, thanks
4	1324944000	I give the IPOD Touch a 4 Star Rating.  I purchased it for my son who is an athlete in college.  He takes it everywhere.Apple iPod touch 8GB (4th Generation) - Black - Current Version
3	1324944000	No SD slot + No sharing + No FLACs = AppleI think my Samsung galaxy tab 10.1 is enough for me.
5	1324944000	The iPod Touch is very easy to use.  It is very simple to setup  and provides easy access to your music and movies, not to mention All the apps you can enjoy!!
5	1324944000	Received the Apple iPod Touch in the mail from Amazon.  The order arrived timely and was a hit with my 10 year old daughter.  The iPod Touch has many capabilities and is an excellent gift idea for most kids ages 10 and up.
3	1324944000	This Ipod is a good product, but I think a lot of its functions are done by the Iphone, so since I have both, the Ipod tends to get left behind more and more often, and I take my Iphone everywhere. The quality is good and I think there's probably a lot it can do that the Iphone can't, but for basic music needs, you don't need the Iphone and Ipod both. If you're like me and aren't all that tech savvy, you'll probably find that the Iphone fills the need for both phoning and entertainment.
5	1324944000	I purchased this for my ten year old daughter.  She loves this ipod.  The item came in time for Christmas (keeping true to the shipping time frame).  We have had no problems with it so far but it's only been two days.  It does seem that she is running the battery down in it rather quickly but she is playing games on it a lot too.  We didn't have any problems getting the i-pod set up.  I've still not downloaded all of her music to it yet.  I am working my way through our cd's and adding a little each night to the player.  We also downloaded a the free text app which she loves.  When she is connected to wi-fi, she can have access to text.  My biggest problem is the ipod charging  - it charges while connected to the laptop but my laptop will go into sleep mode after so many minutes of non-use.  When this happens, the i-pod does not charge properly. I am planning on purchasing a wall charger to correct this issue. Other than this, the i-pod is what I expected.  Now I just need to invest in bubble wrap :)
5	1324944000	Received product quickly, everything looked and works great, and we were happy to save some money by purchasing it through Amazon! Would happily recommend to family and friends.
5	1324944000	I ordered an IPod here on amazon and I have been waiting for my IPod to come. It hasn't come back so I am waiting for you to give me my IPod i payed for.
5	1324944000	Product came just how I wanted it. Excellent design, function, and look. I am very happy with my purchase. Will buy future products similar to this one.
5	1324944000	Great product at a great price...this was a Christmas gift for my son this year. It arrived quickly and it was less expensive than at any other places especially right after Black Friday.
5	1324944000	Everyone in the family loves the ipod touch. My son got one for his birthday and we had to get a family one for Christmas because he was constantly having to share his. The only negative thing about it is that it's kind of hard to put the charger in. Other than that, we have no complaints.
5	1324944000	Everything is good. Delivery is as estimated. The only thing to concern is if you want free engraving, order it from Apple (included in its price $10 higher than Amazon's).
5	1324857600	I am new at mactech, but I'm enjoying the podcasts going to itues and wmp. I can burn cds of things I've wanted to share. I
2	1324857600	Was downloading "free" aps on the Samsung within minutes, never even got the iPod to download even after trying to set it up all morning!The Samsung was a breeze, install battery(which is like a cell phone and user replaceable, not like the iPod which says is NOT user replaceable) plug in the $16 16Gb SD micro card(no such upgrade options with the iPod, one must spend $100 more for the 16gb model) and I was downloading free apps.With the iPod(which included NO wall charger, come on Apple how many other devices come without a wall charger! you have to pay extra for a wall charger) I spent all morning trying to download even one app but no luck. To even use this thing you have to setup a iTunes account. I tried many times but kept getting a error that I wasn't old enough to set up a account, and therefor use this device(other than turn it on and look at the nice screen). Anyway I was all the way down to 1970 for a birth date(40+ years old) and it still kept saying to young!!!!(I first tried to be honest and put my daughters birth date(who the iPod was for) but apparently honesty is not the best policy with Apple). Finally I started over with a entirely new name/email account/birth date etc(this time I used 1900 :) and it took, until I got to the point where Apple asked for my CC info! Try as I did I couldn't bypass the requirement to give Apply my CC info! All I was looking for was some free apps, not give anyone my CC info. Thats crap! The iPod is going back and if this is the way Apple operates, I guess Apple isn't for me.The iPad is going back and will be keeping the Samsung with it's Android operating system.The +'s of the Apple are:Looks nice and very thin.Ability to purchase many aftermarket accessories.Apple quality, apparently Apple is known for being built quite well.After discounts, slightly lower price than Samsung.Touch screen is very accurate and screen is very sharp, but a bit small.The -'s of the Apple(compared to the Samsung Galaxy 4.0)Insistence to use iTunes and everything that goes with iTunes.Non user replaceable battery.No ability to simply and cheaply upgrade memory.No included wall charger, must purchase separate charger or use your computers USB port.The camera(front and rear)is not nearly the quality of Samsung.Smaller screen than Samsung(but iPod may be a tad sharper which is good).Others who already have a iTunes account may have better luck setting up this product but for someone setting it up for the first time(and telling the truth on the users age) I would NOT suggest this product.
5	1324857600	Quick shipper. My child loves this thing.  It was a Christmas Gift for her. So far its a great product.  Just gotta figure out how to set up two iTunes accounts on one computer.
5	1324857600	My 12 year old daughter is thrilled with her new iPod touch, 8 GB, 4th Generation . . . she especially likes the "white" color.  It performs everything that she wants to do.  Easy to operate.  Very happy with this purchase!  :)
5	1324857600	THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE WAS SO SURPRISED AND HAPPY.SHE ENJOYS COMMUNICATING WITH HER FRIENDS AND LISTENING TO MUSIC. PERFECT GIFT FOR HER.
5	1324857600	Great product!  My daughter got this ipod touch for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.  It is easy to work and very stylish.
5	1324857600	This iPod is the perfect solution for anyone that wants all the joys of an iPhone without the cost of a data plan. With city wide WIFI in Minneapolis it functions as a VOIP most of the time. You can facetime, iMessage and use all of the apps. The iCloud functions across all of our devices which is great as we have a new baby and are constantly showing off pictures. The look and feel of the 4th gen iPod is amazing and is much slimer than my 4th gen iPhone. It is simply an all around great device and well work under $200.
5	1324857600	The latest iProduct to my household. Son loves this gift. Can do everything he borrowed my iPad for in the past. Nice to see an 8 yr old inviting mom to play Words With Friends.No wall charger inluded.:(
5	1324771200	I just got this today and I must say it is amazing. It is a great birthday present for anybody at any age to be truthful.The screen is amazing nd teh sound quality is great. Just make sure you purchase a good case for it because it is rather light and can easily slip out of your hands if you are not careful.
4	1324771200	"Games + Apps. What iPod touch was made for." "over 500K apps"  Ok, I was really excited to get this but then the first app I tried - the compass and magnetometer do not work on the iTouch. Even this 'upgraded, new version'. It's misleading to think there's a map service that can get you anywhere, hence a gps system, but a compass (and magnetometer) won't work. Sadly I had to send it back. I did like most everything else - including that there's a speaker that they do not tell you about. But the most important app for me will not work. So, four stars for not enough serious information on it.
5	1324771200	I bought the Apple iPod Touch for my 6-year old grandson, and he loves it!!!He is totally addicted to it! As soon as he gets home from school,he goes to use it!He loves the Facetime feature, and the text feature as well, but the apps are so entertaining for him!
5	1324771200	Both of my children have these.  Great product at a great price.  Wont be the last apple product we buy.
5	1324771200	This lived up to all expectations. Great for many age groups. Bought as a gift for 10 yr. old boy who loved it!!His 15 yr.old brother also got one and has as much fun with it as the younger. I'm a grandparent and want one now too.Apple has scored high with the iPod Touch. Amazon did great with the price this season on the IPod Touch.
5	1324684800	This is the best gadget for the price it offers. It has everything that a smartphone can offer except the voice calls. but, who cares? i need not shell out extra 400 bucks for that. The software(IOS5) is exactly same as what is being offered on latest iphone and ipad.I use it exhaustively for VOIP calls, social networking, checking mails etc. I recommend this to anybody who wants to be connected at a cheaper cost.
4	1324684800	I love my new iTouch. It has everything I ever needed. But one question.... why does it only have a 6.4gb capacity? I paid for 8gb! Other than that, its a great product.
5	1324684800	I ordered this item several weeks ago, along with alot of other items. I always do all my christmas and birthday shopping on amazon. I didn't notice until Dec. 23rd that this item was missing from the box when I started going through all the boxes. Amazon overnighted a replacement to me and I received it Dec. 24th at about 9 in the morning. Amazon was a life saver for doing this! I'm so pleased that Amazon stepped up to the plate when it was needed most!! Thank you Amazon for such great service!!!!!!!
5	1324684800	Bought this for my daughter's 16th b-day. She was sooo happy. Very impresses with the condition, in mint. As far as ipod4 goes it's very fast.  Very happy!!  =)
5	1324684800	This iPod was totally worth it! (: thought it was going to be a bad idea to buy it..but Nevermindniw I can say that they do sell good things in amazon.com
1	1324598400	I didnt receiving the version I paid for.  I paid for generation 4 and didnt get it.  Got an older one.
5	1324598400	This purchase was too good to be true. I got my ipod touch from the amazon warehouse. All I had to do was install the itunes app and everything was working. I use it all the time(especially on the bus to school) so I needed quality merchandise and a great battery life. I can listen to my ipod for hours without interruption from a 20% low battery warning. Over 6 months later my ipod still works (even though it has probably dropped twice). Again, too good to be true!
5	1324598400	The ipod was used but completely like new. Not even taken out of the packaging. Im loving it! Thank you.
2	1324598400	the battery is poor, no more one hour with internet, fotos, o other operation.I need charging several times per dayI received this product dec 21 2011 is new item
1	1324598400	the apple itouch 4G is not working properly. i am disappointed with my product its getting hanged and what ever application i download is not working after 3 to 4 days .I want my  money back .
5	1324598400	Love the white color than the black and is a great product for texting and using it similar to a smartphone.
5	1324598400	I'm not much on listening to music all the time, but I have used my iPod Touch a few times for that purpose and it sounds great. I know it's classified as an MP3 player, but it's SO much more.... which is ultimately why I bought it.I don't need an iPad, nor do I want to lug one around with me everywhere I go.  What I wanted was something that allows me to easily carry my calendar and contacts around with me.  The ability to read email was also a requirement.  I have no use for a smartphone, especially for the grand or so a year that it costs to own one.I have wifi at home and at work, so my iPod is always up to date.  When I'm wandering around the buildings at work or sitting in the living room at home, I can access my email, receive appointment reminders, check my calendar and tasks and look up a phone number.  I can record a quick note to myself, or record a voice memo if desired.  I can even snap a quick photo, which I've done a couple times (though it's not the greatest camera).For my needs, this device is perfect... it sits in my shirt pocket and has no monthly fees.The screen is outstanding though I don't feel it is realistic to attempt much web browsing in that it is just too small.  It's also rather hard to hold on to so I highly recommend a silicone case or some other means of encasing it.  I purchased a black silicone "AmazonBasics Silicone Case with Tread" ($10.00) and found that it made a world of difference when it comes to handling the iPod.In general, this device has a "iPhone without the phone" feel to it.  Precisely what I was looking for.
5	1324512000	dont buy this anywhere else u save money with free shipping no tax and 15 dollars of retail! thats 30 dollars off rather than buying from apple or best buy!
5	1324512000	Just got this a few days ago because my old one gave out. I really like the color. My mom and brother also have one but in black and they also love it.
5	1324512000	Love the iPod touch, it is great for games, kindle, e-mail and playing your music.  However the 2 iPods we ordered arrived with the box open and dumped out at the curb.
5	1324425600	Oh wow! this gadget just blow my mind... I'm still checking all of the things that it can do...Amazon really ships really freakin' fast! it came to my door step 2 days earlier than the due date... all I can say is WOW! :]so guys...this is an awesome gift for yourself or someone else...simply awesome! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
5	1324425600	The iPod I bought from amazon.com is great, I use it for a lot of things. It's a great present for just about anyone wether their a music lover or if they just want it just for the heck of it and, also amazon is also cheaper than having to go to the store and buying it.
5	1324425600	I absolutely love this new ipod touch, I bought it as a gift for my brother. Great features. Fantastic design.  500,000 Apps. I love how slim it is. Retina display quality is unbelievable.
5	1324425600	We've now bought 4 iPods for ourselves and our adult children! They are great fun, very portable, apps are free or cheap and they can be used with free WiFi in coffee shops, etc. There is no "contract", no fee for use...bonus! And Amazon delivered it to my door very quickly and very well-packed. Great item!
5	1324339200	this is the best creation apple made this is amazing it can do almost ANYTHING it includes camera it can film video chat touch screen download songs texting ant like much more.
5	1324339200	I bought a basic 8GB model to use a my personal organizer (I have a 3rd gen iPod for my music). It works flawlessly. The design is sleek and attractive.
5	1324252800	Love the I-pod touch. Better than the other I-pod that I had. This one doesn't lock up while playing in my car like my old one did. I would recommend this to anyone. Great for kids since you can download games for them to play to keep them occupied.
5	1324166400	I asked for the white ipod and it's very pretty. I'm satisfied with it. It's just what I wanted, and it's very useful.
5	1324166400	Everything about the ipod is so natural and perfect. The retina display has such an amazing picture. My biggest problem is the 8gb model. You might think 8gbs is enough but if you want plenty of games and you actually want to use the camera to record and save videos then DONT GET THE 8GB its simply not enough space to store ALL the games that you would want. If you can Definitely go for the 32GB or 64GB models, you'll be glad you did. Besides that the ipod couldn't be much better, its such a great thing to have when your bored and once you get one you cant be without one.
4	1324166400	I previously owned either the 2nd or 3rd generation iPod Touch, but it decided to disappear on me.  I'm still holding out hope that it will one day just turn up.In any event, I bought myself the 4th generation iPod Touch. I'm even happier with this than with my previous iPod Touch.PROS:Extremely Portable - I can take this thing anywhere.  It fits nicely in my pocket and sometimes it's in there with my wallet or keys, and it does fine, with no scratches, etc.  I don't even have a protective case for it...though I should probably invest in one.  I can't comment on dropping it, because I haven't done that yet, at least not from a significant height or upon a very hard surface.  And hopefully that won't happen.  I have heard the horror stories of a cracked iPod screen.  Again - see aforementioned protective case comment. The form factor is great. It is super thin and though it's slick, it doesn't slip out of my hands.  My cell phone, which is much thicker and heavier slips from my grip all the time and has many little dings and bruises to show for it.Display: It has a beautiful display.  Very vibrant colors and very sharp.  Much better than the previous generation iPod Touch.Fast - The iPod Touch is quick - really quick.  I can scroll among apps very quickly and fluidly.  Apps open promptly and load times are very short.  Exiting apps is very easy as all you have to do is press the home button and you're back to the main menus.  The internet connection is also pretty fast and finding wi-fi connections is very easy.  Load times for most web pages are very quick and because so many sites you go to all the time are available through their own dedicated apps, that makes getting to those sites even quicker.Internet - As mentioned above, the internet connection is fast.  And this thing is great at finding wi-fi connections.  Take it to Starbucks and it will find the AT&T; wifi without blinking an eye.  It's receiver is strong too, so you could be standing outside a place with wifi, right next door, or even across the street from it, and still latch onto that place's wifi connection.  Safari isn't perfect, but it's fine for browsing the internet.  Also, I love the pinch to zoom and multi-touch display that allows you to zoom in and pan whilst on the web. The internet apps that you can download, many of them for free, are great.  You can get Netflix, etc...and even the Kindle app.  It streams video very quickly.  You don't even need a Kindle to read Kindle ebooks.  It's not e-ink (the iPod has an LCD screen) and the size is much smaller than a Kindle, but it's possible to read e-books on this.  You can always adjust the text size if it is too small.  If you get the iPod Touch, definitely get the Kindle App.  Plus, if you already have a Kindle or an Android phone or something, you can sync any of your books and content to the iPod Touch's Kindle App as well.  That's a great bonus. You can easily link this up through your web-based email account of your choice so that you can always get instant access to your emails (when connected to wifi).Games - Because Apple offers so many great Apps and there are so many great free Apps and games, there is no shortage of great games.  We aren't talking just Minesweeper or air hockey.  You can get games like Need for Speed or EA Sports games on here.Music - of course, being an iPod, you can download tons of songs of your choice. And it has a nice cover-flow feature which lets you easily sort through the full-color album or song covers.Video - It's great at streaming video and you can buy videos to download directly to the device.Management - Very easy to download new apps or to delete apps to free up space.  Very easy to change basic settings, too.  Has dedicated physical volume control buttons, too.CONS:There are very few cons I can think of, except of course, if you lose it or break it.  In that case, the biggest con is not having it anymore.This is not perfect.Battery life is probably its biggest downside. If you're reading an e-book, checking email, doing light web browsing, or listening to music, the battery does okay.  But when you play a game, watch a video (streaming or otherwise), then this thing drinks juice like there's no tomorrow. Make sure you have some kind of portable charger or means to keep it charged if you are on long trips, etc. One tip: if you are not using the internet, turn off wifi, otherwise it will suck even more battery life because it is constantly searching for wifi connections.Sometimes, apps will shut down without any warning and just kick you back out to the main menu.  But it's usually not hard to get right back into the app.  The biggest problem occurs if you are in the middle of typing a long email, etc. and it decides to kick you out.  You can lose all your work.For the most part the integrated touch QWERTY keyboard is quite intuitive, but also not perfect as typos are very easy to make.  Also, as is well known about Apple products, word prediction is sometimes abominable.  Just be sure to proofread what you type before saving it or sending it, otherwise you may inadvertently send something very different than you intended.Summary:The latest generation iPod Touch is a great and convenient device with just a couple of minor gripes.  It's great if you are on the go, on long trips, or are stuck waiting in line somewhere for a long time.It's a great smartphone alternative.  If you do not have a smartphone yet, then you may be able to hold out even longer if you get yourself an iPod touch.  With so many places providing free wifi now, it is very easy to find wi-fi internet connections.  Even many buses and maybe even trains have free wifi included.  Obviously, you can't connect to 3G, so there is no internet browsing while riding in a standard car, etc. If you are just out and about, away from home or from somewhere else that offers free wi-fi, there is not internet connection.  However, think about how often you really need the internet.  Chances are you have internet access at home, work, as well as free wifi in many coffee shops, stores, etc.  For those times when you don't have internet access, it shouldn't be too long or too difficult for you to gain access again at some point in the very near future during various intervals of your day.  If you are a business person who absolutely constant access to work email, etc., then maybe you do need a smartphone...but chances are your work may already provide such a device.  For the standard employee however, owning an iPod touch should preclude the need for a smartphone, which will only cost you a fortune (both for the device - some can be $600 or more without a contract or unlocked, as well as for the monthly data plans - which can be as high as $80 or more per month...for what?  Why?)One last point, the iPod Touch is not a phone and it's not a tablet.  However, one can argue that it's just a mini iPad.  Why then, should you pay between $400 and $600 more for something that offers no more than just a little more real estate?Though it's not a phone, the iPod can be.  If you take advantage of FaceTime, you can communicate with someone else over a wi-fi connection who also owns an iPod Touch or iPhone.  Also, you can download Skype and make Skype calls.  Again, you do need wi-fi for that, but this is handy if you want to call overseas with no major cell phone charges. I called my brother in China using Skype on my iPod Touch a couple of times while I was in a standard Starbucks in the U.S.  My cost - $0.  It's also great in an emergency, if your cellphone isn't working.  If you have Skype credit, which isn't too expensive, you can call any land-line or cellphone using Skype.The iPod Touch isn't the world's perfect device - yet...but it provides enough versatility to make it's $200 price tag more than worth it.Also, for the casual user, you probably don't need much more than 8 GB, unless you plan to store and keep lots of movies, etc.
1	1324080000	1 star because it stopped charging after a few months of use.  Solution was to buy a wall adapter (which cost an additional $30).  The ipod works great now and is a fun piece of technology, but it would have been a 5 star if all essential equipment was included in the product price and I wasn't forced to purchase additional equipment simply to charge it correctly. How many phones, cameras, etc. are sold without wall chargers? None.  The ipod should be no different.  Good technology, but gimicks to force customers into purchasing additional equipment that should have been included in the first place.
5	1324080000	Hard to top all the great reviews. We just got an iPod touch for the kids to spare our ipad2 some so we can get our hands on it. It is of course perfect but the one thing I would like to add is the great quality of video input to TV using HDMI. Just by the tech specs, the ipad2 output is 1080 HD while the iPod touch is 720 but practically it makes very little difference. The quality of Netflix and iTunes moves are excellent in HDMI from the iPod. Great sound and supports Apple iCloud which became indispensable especially with iTunes match. Smooth, fast and great screen resolution as it has retina display.
5	1324080000	The apple iPod touch is amazing. It takes beautiful pictures, easy to share with friends and family. There are so many useful app that you can download. If you ever lose it there is an app to locate it. It holds tons of music and the sounds are great. That is just a small portion of the thing that you will love about the iPod touch.
5	1324080000	After seeing the new Apple iPod touch 8 GB 4th Generation in the new white color, I started to read reviews like the one I'am giving. I now have my own and love it. Truly amazing. Each day I discover another function the iTouch can preform or a new app to add to make it more useful. I do not need the more expensive iPhone and the costly air time. My iPod touch has face time that lets me talk to other friends with iPods or iPhones and it is on WiFi, no cost. Great purchase I made,love it.
5	1323993600	It's like holding the universe in my pocket. I love being notified about emails. Pointless checking is history.Apps like Shazam and Midomi - you sing into the phone and it tells you what you're singing (No more wondering `What is that tune in my head?') it's extraodinary.As for download games - I was playing Blade Dash on it for about two hours last night. I felt like I was back in the arcade it's so good!Music - it's an Ipod, we know it's good for that ;)And as for reading - well, I downloaded Bram Stoker's Dracula. I'm now reading on the Ipod :)Amazing. Five stars!
5	1323993600	I've had my iPod touch for 2 years now and it's still in mint condition and I use it A LOT every single day. I do have a leather case for it, but the screen is completely open and its very well made. I constantly have it in my pocket and have no issues with it scratching or anything.As for the music quality, it's amazing! Couldn't be better. Also, Apple has MASTERED the touch screen and it's absolutely flawless.Battery life is starting to dwindle a little bit when using the internet and running a few apps, but to help maintain longer battery life, I simply disable the WIFI and close the apps I'm not using. If you just use it for music, the thing will run for days if not weeks.I'm very impressed with the iPod touch and although I hope this one lasts me a lot longer, I will be buying another one the SECOND this one dies on me. I've had NO problems with it at all and as mentioned, I used it for hours a day because I have a desk job and am able to listen to music. I love this thing!I really would put this as my number one most favorite product I own. I could not live without this thing.
5	1323993600	Come on Apple, increase the screen size to 4.3" or 4.5", at 1280 x 720 pixels.Then add a light sensor so the screen brightness changes automatically.Lastly, allow us to play a variety of video formats (wmv, avi, mpg, mkv) from our home networks,without going through iTunes.One other thing, give us a gamepad accessory that attaches to the charge/sync connector, thengaming would be awesome on this device!  Here is what it should look like:Sony PEGA-GC10 Game Controller for PEG-NX, NR, T, SJ, SL SeriesThat would be the PERFECT iPod Touch, and we would pay extra for it too!  Then we would have NO reasonto even consider Android!
4	1323907200	Nice portable device for music and a lot more. I absolutely love it. RETINA display is awesome.The only setback is the battery. Once I got the iPod Touch 4th Gen, I upgraded the system to IOS 5.0. I noticed that if the wifi is on, the battery goes out fast. So every time I don't need wifi (e.g. listening to audio book), I would turn it off to save the battery.
5	1323907200	Love it. Cannot wait to give it to my chid for Christmas! Came in apple packaging. Best price I could find!
3	1323907200	I love my new White touch 4 but for some reason I feel that it is a lot slower than it should be. Like when i try to unlock the screen b/c i wanna change a song, the arrow slides to the end but then stays there and it basically freezes there for a while... its a bit depressing since its only a month old...if it was say 2 years old I would be fine with its slowness. Is there a reason for the slowness? Sometimes when I try to exit out of games or programs it takes ~8 secs to exit (may not sound that long but for a month old electronic it shouldn't be this faulty). Also when i opened the box i found a couple of scratches on the back, i don't really mind it and don't feel that it is necessary to return it over that. However I am wondering if I can still return this item because of how slow it is (its getting pretty annoying) even though I h ave used it for about 3 weeks now?besides that amazingly big problem, I like my touch, just not enough for a 4-5 star.
5	1323907200	Es incre&iacute;ble al recibirlo! primero el color blanco es hermoso, se conecta a Internet muy bien, la app store funciona de maravilla, la c&aacute;mara aunque no tiene muchos megapixels toma buenas fotos y al bajarle el instagram puedes jugar con los efectos. Recomendado 100%
5	1323907200	I really like it, if I can get wireless then it is same as iPhone. However once in a while I will have to reboot because it is very slow.
3	1323820800	I haven't opened the iPod completely because it's a Christmas giftBut, I didn't receive any paperwork/or even an in voiceWith it so I am a bit concerned.  Did it have a warranty orAnything?  If you could pleas send me the paperwork inCase something happens to it or we become dissatisfied soThat we can take proper action.Thanks!Mrs. Szymanski
1	1323820800	so i decided to sell my ipod touch 3g 32gb and i wanted one with camera so i order this one.Big Mistake!! this thing is so slow! so damn slow! each time i try to open an app it lacks by 3or more seconds.the screen broke within 4 weeks!! this thing just dropped one time n it cracked.unlike the 3g i dropped that thing a million times n never had an issue.i regret buying this ipod and now i have to pay 75.00 to get it fix n thats a deal i supposedly got.
5	1323820800	I Received this item in great condition and very quickly.... Buying on Amazon saves so much time it's a great shopping site.
5	1323734400	I bought my daughter the ipod touch for Christmas. It has so many fun features. She uses her ipod touch all the time. I definitely got my money's worth. What a great gift.
5	1323734400	works great,put all my music on it. Have added some apps and weather locations. Everything is working great. I'm very happy with my purchase.
5	1323734400	received the item in just a few days.  very happy withthe purchase, and the price i received!thanks AMAZON!!
5	1323734400	I wish I could buy this to each my family member....we are six in a family, this item make my doughter hapiest girl in the world
5	1323734400	I bought this for my granddaughter's birthday.  I couldn't have bought her anything better. She absolutely loves it.She loves the idea of being able to store so much music on it. After searching locally for the iPod, I decided to go with Amazon.com.  They had the very best price, no shipping or tax and very fast delivery.  Amazon is the greatest!
5	1323734400	my fiance bought me one of these  when it came out way back when. the battery life on this one is much better than on the 2nd generation that i used to have and the screen is PERFECT!! itll hold me over until he gets me an iphone ;)
5	1323648000	This Ipod literally looks and feel like a brand new ipod. I am very impressed with this product and it was well worth the price. Their is not a scratch on the back or screen, this Ipod was in immaculate condition. I would like to do business with you again.
5	1323648000	I was looking for a cheap, small eReader to take advantage of the multitude of book available from the Gutenberg Project.  I also wanted the ability to play music and perhaps stream some internet videos.I looked at both the Kindle Fire, Nook Color, and Nook Tablet.  All three did everything I needed, books, music, and Netflix.  However, I still found myself wishing either Amazon or Barnes and Noble offered something smaller that would fit in my pocket.  That's when I noticed a friend reading a book on her iPhone.  After a little research I learned the iPod Touch could do the same.The Stanza app gives access to free books from the Gutenberg Project.  Amazon and Barnes and Noble both offer free apps for their respective book stores, putting the best of both worlds within your reach.Having an eReader this small allows me to read books anywhere without worrying about stowing a 7" Nook or Kindle.  While not a replacement for a larger reader it complements one nicely.
5	1323648000	Its good. I like the color. I bought this for my sister as a gift but I kinda want it for myself now. The only issue was it arrived 3 days after it said this product has been received so I almost called amazon and USPS.
5	1323561600	I bought the iPod touch a few weeks ago and I absolutely love it!! The only setback was that at first the battery life was about a day, partially because I was doing stuff on it almost constantly.  Then I figured out that it saves the battery a lot if you turn the wifi off when you're not using it like when I'm at school or somewhere else that doesn't have wifi other wise it's always searching for networks. Now it will last 2 or 3 days on one charge.  Other wise I have no problems with it.  I would definitely recommend it.
5	1323561600	this is a GREAT product.  I bought it in the summer and had a great time with it.now i'm going to upgrade to a 32gb now for MORE fun.  You can do everything, read books, browse the internet at quick speeds.  Basically a mini-tablet/iPad.  Games are also great.  you can meet new people, with games such as tap tap revenge. it's better than a psp in that it's easier to use, more games to use from.  you can also use it in school as a student, and use it at home personally.
5	1323475200	I bought this thing for my daughter because her old mp3 player wasn't working the way she wanted it to. She LOVES her new ipod touch! It didn't take her long to figure out how to use it, I see her using it all the time! It can go online, it has a GREAT camera, it can do ANYTHING!
5	1323475200	Got my son an itouch because he kept wanting to use my iphone.  Now he is showing me what other capabilities my phone has that I never knew existed.  The itouch also works as a discipline tool: If homework is not done, then no itouch time.  Great product, i feel soon he will ask me for an ipad.
5	1323475200	IVE OWNED ONE OF THESES IN THE PAST BUT WHEN I GOT MY NEW ONE  RIGHT OUT OF THEBOX I COULDNT STOP saying wow oh my gosh wow this is just amazing apple you have outdone yourself again  im in love with this and my 3ds
5	1323475200	My son has been waiting to get an iPod touch for months - he loves it and we have to make him put it away at night.
5	1323388800	Being  first time user with Apple products its a great device that works for the newbie or veteran user. It's easy to manuver around the apps and web sites . I love it and it does more than I expected.
4	1323388800	I waited about six months before posting this review in order to get a feel for the device. All in all I think that it works reasonably well.Originally I had an iPod Mini as my music player. After five years, its battery became defective and I thought would be more cost effective to upgrade to an iPod Touch than to replace the battery.  I chose the iPod because it had wifi and I could use it for email, Internet access, and Google Talk, Skype, and other web applications (wherever wifi was available.)Apple claimed it was essentially an iPhone without the phone part. Well it's not! For one thing it is so thin that it's difficult to hold it by its edges without dropping it; it is very prone to being dropped. It looks incredibly fragile so I purchased a good case to protect it.Second its volume buttons are so recessed at the side that it's difficult to adjust the volume. Also, it has no pause/resume button on the side. To pause the music quickly (without going to the screen), I need to unplug the earbuds. To resume, I press the "on screen" resume button.I also cannot understand why Apple insists on an "unlock" slide bar every time I need to access my iPod. At least, there should be an override to disable it.As far as the cameras are concerned, I really am not concerned with the poor resolution of the camera on the back. I rarely use it for taking pictures and therefore it's good enough for me. On the other hand the front camera (facing the user) is a terrific improvement because I use it for Skype (and Google Talk with video).Another problem (not directly related to the iPod) is iTunes. The iTunes program does not work properly with my iPod in my windows PC. It tends to lose the synchronization with my music library and seems to refuse to properly upgrade my apps.  I now use iTunes' manual mode to update the music on the iPod. Unfortunately, there is no manual mode for apps, pictures and videos. Fortunately, apps can be updated directly from the cloud. Pictures and videos have no cloud sync (only direct synchronization), so I email them to myself.Apple - in its "control freak" mentality - will soon force you to do everything from its own cloud - called "iCloud". So far it is still allowing the iPod calendar app to sync with Google's calendar in the cloud. But now that it has its own iCloud calendar with iOS5, I fear that all other clouds will soon be locked out.One very big plus is its Bluetooth which I now use with a headset (Motorola S305) and also with a remote receiver (Logitech Wireless Speaker Adapter for Bluetooth audio devices) for my hi-fi system. I love Bluetooth and would hope that Microsoft would have full Bluetooth support in Windows 8 and that all PC manufacturers build it in to their PC's.While it's a terrific device I gave it four stars because of the shortcomings mentioned above.
4	1323302400	This is the second ipod touch I purchased as a gift for someone else. Can someone tell me why they only come with a usb cord and not a wall jack too?
5	1323302400	This is the first time I get an iPod. It's awesome. Looks great and the 8 gb works for me. Totally recommended.
1	1323302400	I ordered an iPod. I was so excited when it came and ripped it open. Turns out as i opened it, i had been sent the wrong generation of iPod touch.
1	1323302400	I've been through at least 4 iPods in our family, and at least one iTouch, and all of them went dead in less than a year.  Either we are extremely unlucky, or these products are just shoddily constructed.I have a HTC Droid phone that's been dropped more then a few times and thrown by a toddler, and IT is still functioning perfectly.  How come it can survive true rough usage, whereas the i-Whatevers can't seem to survive their mundane, coddled pre-toddler existences?I refuse to buy another one.  They just don't seem to last, and that's a really expensive amount to be shelling out every year.  I'll definitely be trying another manufacturer this time around.
5	1323302400	it's nice but it's cheaper on apple.com on Black Friday.... Anyway, I'm ok with it and it has so many apps that I love!
5	1323302400	lets start with the pros and consprosawsomelightcool ios5esay backupicloudfacetimefasta bunch of appstextingcameraconsterrible batterycameraas yous may have notisted i put camera in pros and cons because there is a camera (pro) but the camera isnt very good(cons)okay this is a relly good prouduct but there are a few things good and bad i would like to point outthe battery life sucks, like relly sucks and if you go very far without a charger you have a problem. the web says it has 40 hours but that first of all that is audio play black wich if all you want is that then just buy a reguler ipod. and then i dont think it is that much. and then relly im on the playing a online game lising to pandora radio and it lasts 45 min on a full charge. im not saying that it isnt a good prouduct it just stinks when it comes to battery life. there good number of pros. facetime is awsome the only pronlum is there arent many people with a capeble prouduct and it seems like you have to call someone first. relly though it is a highly recomended prouduct that is worth the money
5	1323302400	I purchased this Ipod touch as a gift for a family member, so I cant say very much about it... However, I am still using my Ipod Video (30gb) almost every single day, and have been doing so for years now and it still functions perfectly.My only gripe about apple ipod products is that they force you to use Itunes.... Unless you've figured a way to get around it ;-)All i can really say, is that these little things make one HECK of a gift. Seriously, who DOESN'T want an Ipod???
4	1323216000	It was a gift for my granddaughter.  She loves it, works great and most of the apps that she wanted were free.
4	1323216000	I got an iPod touch because I couldn't afford a data plan but I still wanted something pocket sized that I could access the internet on. So far it's working out well - everything works the way it should. I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of a GPS, but that isn't too big of a problem.Overall, it's a great device for its price range, but there are a lot of better things you could get if you have another $50-$100 you could spend.
5	1323216000	ThIs Ipod was at a ggod price and gets attention everywhere i go. This white ipod should have came out long time ago
3	1323216000	the battery life is ridiculous  over all i like it i don't have a lot  music on my ipod only games after two hours playing it dies and it becomes very hot.
3	1323216000	if u have an andriod then its a waste of money. you have to be connected to internet to use most apps. like fb. wish it had 3g network where u dont have to have actual internet connection to use
3	1323216000	Bought this for my daughter as a present. Was nice at first but unfortunately now it refuses to sync. I had to restore all the original settings, delete all existing content and start again. Very annoying.
5	1323216000	I am very happy with my purchase. I know the person the item was bought for will be very happy to open on Christmas morning!
5	1323216000	I did not buy this item for my own use but as a gift. The party who receivedit had nothing but nice things to say. VERY HAPPY everything was excelent.
5	1323129600	This is my third iPod Touch.I still have the first and second generation models, but they have become a kind of slow running the latest supported iOS and its apps,  plus the fact that they lack cameras and microphone, so I finally decided to buy a new one.My previous iPod Touch models have 32 Gb memory, but I discovered that I don't really use all the apps that I downloaded, so this time, I bought the 8 Gb to save some money.I mainly use the Touch to make Skype calls to my family and friends. Skype is great. My subscription plan averages about $8.25 per month, and I can make both domestic and international calls almost without time restriction (10,000 minutes per month). Skype-to-Skype calls are always free. My plan is to cover Skype calls to landlines and cellphones. And Skype continues to work even when you are overseas. There is no roaming or other expenses.If you need a handset when talking using Skype, I'd recommend this neat thing; it is very good:Native Union Moshi Moshi Retro POP Handset for iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Android Phones - Soft Touch - BlackYou can use the video feature when using Skype or FaceTime to chat with friends. This is really the most compelling reason why I updated to this generation of iPod Touch. I also have an iPad, but IMO, being seen making a call on it or taking a picture using it looks a kind of silly, so using iPod Touch is still the most suitable.Another use for my iPod Touch is magazine reading. I urge you to try Zinio, as it is IMO the largest and best magazine platform out there. Because of the Retina Display on the 4th Gen. iPod Touch, it is comfortable to read even on a 3.5-inch screen. Furthermore, you can switch from page mode to text mode for even better text clarity. Digital magazines are also much cheaper here than at other places, such as Amazon Kindle Fire and Barnes&Noble; Nook platforms. You can download your magazines for offline reading or archival backup. Zinio always keeps a copy for you in its "cloud" so you can access it from any place that has Internet.One more thing, now that the iPod Touch has cameras, I downloaded QR Code readers to experiment the speed and accuracy of the scanner apps. QR Code is a square-looking graphic with tiny black and white squares arranged in seemingly random pattern. It contains computer-readable code that once scanned, will give you more information, link you to a website, or even run a video. The best QR Code scanner IMO is i-nigma; it is fast and accurate. As to regular barcode, I like pic2shop and Quick Scan. These two will scan a barcode behind a CD case, for example, and then display information about it, including a list of places you can buy it and the prices. It's just another way to help consumers to do comparison shopping.
5	1323129600	I hope it works as good as it is suppose...this is a gift for christmas for my grand daughter.I will find out on christmas morning........thanks!
5	1323129600	We have 3 of these. Twin 8 yr old girls and my 13 yr old boy. They love playing the games (they only play the free ones) & they can text their freinds only in wifi though. Face time is really cool! the pictures are good also. Only thing I reconmend get a hard case b/c the screen will break easily! I got a 3 cases for 10 from ithrough.com can't go wrong with this gift of any age! and fort hose who don't know you can ONLY use itunes music on them, but you can up load any music you have to itunes.
4	1323129600	it is good product but the only bad thing it has that it hasnt compass so you can not use it as a gps device alson any gps app.
5	1323043200	Good Product for Entertainment and Media, but was defective about 2 weeks after use.  Good for entertainment and media, but i wish I never bought it.  It's a waste of money, trust me.  Your better off with an Iphone or any other phone with Entertainment and media capabilities.
5	1322956800	Does the ipod touch come with a manufacturer warranty?  I see where you can buy insurance but being a new item it should already be covered for at least a year.
5	1322697600	Love it!!! i had one of the old ipods that have a tiny screen and this is way better! add all the cool features and apps and i'm happy
5	1322697600	Purchased for 4 and 10 yr old boys for X-mas 2010. Have used for 1 year now. Cannot express how great this product is!100's of free games on ItunesPurchase 1 and be able to download to bothPurchase new games any time.$.99c for games (who cares if 1 or 2 are bad, at least $30.00 wasn't spent like on Nintendo or PSP)Backup and restore option. (Kids have each crashed theirs at least twice each. But with the ability to backup and restore, it was a simple process to restore and get working again.)8gb is good for about 9 months, then have to start clearing out space for new games.Netflix works great on these.Only recommendation is to get the 16Gb size or larger.
4	1322697600	I love it.. I used it as a phone for a while with Pinger.. This is much more than a music player!!
5	1322697600	Arrived in perfect condition and on time.(amazon prime is great if you haven't tried it) Thinner then before with a front facing camera. Make sure you order the case with it from here, cases retail in stores for 5-10x the price on here. I bought the 8gb model because I do not really need more than a couple hundred songs on there at a given time. If your going to download thousands of songs and want videos downloaded on there, I would recommend buying the larger storage ones.
4	1322697600	As much as I dislike Apple's way of making you use their proprietary interface and software, I like this iPod.  It's well executed.  User interface is just very well done.  The screen and menu respond very well to touch.  Simply beautiful.Dislikes are as follows:1.  Don't like the fact that it does not have a standard USB or mini-USB port.... so have to use Apple's proprietary interface.2.  Don't like the fact that iTunes software has to be used to load up songs.  Can't simply click and drag stuff into folders on the device.  It's quite fortunate that iTunes has a good user interface.  But still do not like the limitation of it.It's simply a very elegant and well executed product.  But it could've been better by using industry standard interfaces.
5	1322697600	I love this ipod so much. I finally caved after having the same 2nd generation ipod nano for 5 years. Everything is practical ,and the quality is incredible.
5	1322697600	I've bought other palm computers over the years (Palm III, Palm Vx, Sony Clie), used them, and sold them.  The iPod touch is leap years ahead of any of the others and clearly in a class of its own.  Beautifully designed, responsive, bright vivid colors, excellent user interface, stable operating system, great battery life, and wide selection of apps.  It's intuitive and simple to use.  By now everybody knows all of this.  I bought my iPod about 1 year ago and use it all the time.I enjoy streaming movies using the Netflix app (this alone makes it worth the price), to surf the web, and for some games.  Other apps are nice and occasionally used.  Video calls on Skype are fun and easy.  I probably have 40+ apps on board.  I take a few pictures (maybe 50 on the device now), keep a few albums of songs.  The 8GB model is fine for this, and still has room.  I haven't yet felt the need for more memory.  If you want to take lots of pics, store tons of albums, or save movies onboard, get a device with more memory.
5	1322697600	[I regret to report that some of Apple's behind-the-scenes upgrading and automation is producing freezes, confusion, and chaos.  You may wish to hold back on accepting the upgrades until present difficulties are resolved.  Especially "dangerous" is Apple's so-called Genius.  The feature is capable of requiring you to create a Genius list, denying the attempt (the reason: you don't have sufficient eligible songs), and then locking up the iPod.  Unlike earlier upgrades, there is no "Turn Off Genius" provision in the menu system.  Apparently Apple wants to coerce customers into buying enough "Genius" songs to qualify.  I'm presently trying to wipe my iPod clean and start from scratch.Two warnings, based on personal experience: 1. Be careful not to create a 2nd I.D.  It confuses matters considerably, since Apple would not allow me to remove one.  2. Avoid at all costs anything related to "Genius."  Even with 3000 songs on my iPod it: A. couldn't find enough related songs to create a Genius list; B. it caused all of the music on my iPod to freeze up, with no provision for deactivating "Genius."  Much of Apple's automation and cleverness (rating your songs? forfeiting control of your music?) seems aimed at kids with Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber on their minds and money in their pockets.  Under no circumstances, allow Genius to be activated--at least until Apple provides a way of turning it off so that you can regain control of your iPod.}Surprisingly, there are searches on Amazon for the iPod Touch 5th generation.  Apple hasn't gotten there--yet.  But this is closer than many shoppers might realize.  It's the iPod Touch 4G in it's absolute newest, most current version, with the revolutionary iOS5 operating system.  If you want to be absolutely sure that the previous sentence is accurate, order your Touch in white rather than black.  The 4G that came out in 2010 was exclusively in black; the 4G that was introduced two months ago in 2011 comes in both black and white.  Hence, to take no chances, order in white and remain in delight about your brand new, latest (guaranteed) iPod Touch.I use my iPods primarily as music players.  Despite Apple's cluttering of iTunes with all sorts of annoying features, teasers, plugs, gratuitous promotions, social networking, etc., this is the fastest, the most efficient, the most powerful iPod I've had the pleasure of using.  Hook it up to better earphones than the ones that are standard issue from Apple or to a full-frequencied speaker system.  On the other hand, this iPod's built-in speaker is now actually better than the add-on auxiliary iPod speakers that Griffin, Logitech and other makers were peddling a mere 2-3 years ago.  At night I no longer require a "pillow speaker."  Slipping the slim Touch in my pillowcase threatens to set the mattress on fire.As a review in the Wall Street Journal points out, Apple's Cloud technology is ahead of that of any other manufacturer.  In fact, you're not even required to download your audio files from the Cloud, a time-killing, space-filling exercise--but only with Apple.  What their Cloud does is identify the tune requested and match it up ("Air Match") with what is already residing in Apple's limitless universe.  As a result, your request is granted instantly and ultra-efficiently.No matter that the cameras (at least one too many from my perspective) aren't quite as good as the iPhone's.  They're still more sensitive and sharp than any other player's--or smart phone's.  The truly innovative feature on the iPhone that you won't find on the Touch is Apple's exclusive, "Siri" voice-recognition technology, which is said to be leagues ahead of the competition.  Users of the iPhone say they no longer have any use for similar services--on their GPS, computer, or from Google.  Siri has clearly scooped them all, exceeding all expectations.What should you spend your $200 on?  A Touch 4G (preferably in white) or a Kindle Fire (with free movies, Netflix, etc., on a screen twice the size of the Touch's)?  That's a tough one, because the Fire, despite some grumbling (lots of envy of Amazon for being able to produce a tablet like this--taking a $50 loss on each one sold), is an impressive little machine in its own right, capable of "expanding" the screen merely by the outsized stereophonic sound it produces.  Moreover, I'm becoming increasingly impatient with all the "apps" that threaten to take over Apple's "content" space.  Many are space-wasters and over-priced at that (the free ones often aren't good enough to deserve so much space).  Still, if your life is centered on music, the Touch 4G (preferably in white) gets the nod.P.S.  I rarely use my iPod Touch as a camera but yesterday had no other option during a Christmas concert with 4 choirs and narrators placed in a 360 degree configuration.  I didn't even have my special add-on microphone, "Mikey," from Blue Microphones with me.  Bottom line: the Touch did an admirable job of both recording the affair (much to my surprise) and filming it--in available light that was more dark than illuminated.  Playing the video back on my computer is almost like reliving the experience.  (The only instrument that is missing with most small microphones and speakers is the double bass, especially on jazz recordings where the instrument's "walking" of the time is critical to capturing the event.)  Finally, rumor has it that Apple may introduce "Siri" to the iPod Touch 4g rather than wait for the Touch 5 G. Although voice recognition software does not excite many of us, the experience of those who have used Siri suggests that it's a mind-changer, at the very least.
5	1322611200	This iPod touch was a gift for my son's 13th birthday & he loved it!! It came in exactly as promised!!
5	1322524800	I've had this baby for a few months now and it rocks.  I use it for just about everything.  When I walk I bring my iPod touch with me and listen to music.  The music sounds great.  At home, I browse the internet on it since it's such a pain to get out my laptop when my iPod is right there and ready to go.  Battery life is pretty good, considering.  At least, it outlasts the charge on my laptop.  I play games on it (Angry Birds) and check my email, which is very convenient.  Well worth the money I spent.
5	1322524800	It is apple. It is the best. As always, apple did not fail me. Very satisfied with my purchase. Cannot wait to use my iTouch!
5	1322524800	I received this yesterday and think it's amazing. You can access all your Itune updates, buy your music from the touch of a couple buttons. It is worth the price. It is defiantly like an Iphone you just can not talk on the phone with it. It was easy to get started no fusses like some other electronics. Good product!!
5	1322524800	It was in good condition the only thing the charger was damage but I had an extra one so no biggie
1	1322438400	I loved the product for the first 4 months- becuase it actually worked- now the battery will not charge- tried to switch to a different battery- something mechanical wrong with the ipod- went to try to fix it- they wanted 90 bucks just to look at what the problem might be- Great Products while they work.........
5	1322438400	cool little toy. i replaced my nano with this so this is quite a step up. wifi works great . i use it mostly for music but i have downloaded a few app on it . pandora radio is a good one. takes awesome pics. accidently made a phone call or two with it on the text now app. i didnt't even know that was possible.
5	1322438400	We bought this for our daughter & she absolutely loves it! It does so much more than her old iPod & looks great too!
5	1322438400	I love this iTouch.  I had the first generation iTouch, but this one has so many other features.  The camera is really a very convenient app.  It was also so easy to sync up.  I just plugged it into my computer and it synced everything from my old iPods into it, so it was ready to go at the outset.
5	1322438400	Hola Buenas Noches, Compre un ipod touch y el banco emisor de mi tarjeta dice que me cargaron doble la compra, para poder reversar una compra ustedes deben enviarme el soporte de que solo se compro un solo ipod para que ellos me devuelvan el dinero...Gracias...Fernando RodriguezCarcas, VenezuelaFernando_r26@hotmail.com
5	1322438400	Its perfect, just what I wanted, I'm even writing this review on it. Works great four me and it came in a case with headphones and charger. I was just expecting the iPod, so those were some nice addition
5	1322438400	EL IPOD TOUCH ES COMPLETO Y TIENE UNA NITIDES FABULOSA ES EL MEJOR IPOD DE TODOS LOS IPOD QUE HAN SALIDO
5	1322438400	This item was in good working order with a few minor scratches. I would not hesitate to buy it again.
5	1322438400	I've had a 1st gen iPod touch for several years and loved it. I dropped it and cracked the screen or I would still be using it. However, since purchasing the new iPod touch I am almost glad I did. The updates to iOS have made the touch even better than what it was. I'm sure I will use this one until I have to buy a new in several more years.
1	1322352000	Hello their,,I still wait for my Ipod for two weeks without any information's. Could you please help me.what can I do? Also I need your number to call you.
5	1322352000	it works perfectly. Nothing goes wrong. I used this and it's been about a year and it NEVER ever BREAK. You can trust this ipd touch. You'll love it
4	1322352000	As always Ipod are the hot products for the holidays, I bought mine from amazon and my kid loves it. The only concern that I have is that the Ipod freezes and/ or takes a while (2-3 sec) to transition onto another screen. Still a very good product!
5	1322352000	Excellent product. Not much to say that already has been said. The only thing I had problems with is the camera has stopped working a few times. But this can be reset by pushing the on/off button. Directions to do this are available from Apple.Wanted a camera that does video, this does both, plus Internet if you have a connection. Free app to do legal research, plus all the other apps one could purchase at reasonable prices. Not to many cameras can do all that. I find the pictures are pretty decent to me, good quality.Good to have a silicone skin, as it somewhat slippery on the back [chrome finish]. A case also helps to protect it.All in all, a good product to have.
5	1322352000	A very brilliant piece of technology created by intelligent minds,and for the price? very good.Apple keep it up,will definitely be looking out for the new one in 2012...
5	1322265600	I wanted an iPhone, but did not want the costly data plan. With this in mind, I ordered the iPod touch. I got it today, and I love it! What a fun little device! I wish I had it when I was in Europe. It does email, web, skype, and much more. It is very easy to use. I will certianly betaking this little guy on future trips!
5	1322265600	the ipod touch 4g is almost like a phone, it can do ever thing a iphone can do just not the calling or texting part but with wifi you can. most of the time i do not even use my iphone cause i can talk and text for free at my home with wifi using the app text free so yes the ipodtouch 4g deserves 5 stars it is an amazing device.
5	1322092800	wanted to know if the mobile is released, if you can use any sim card from any country, more specifically vodafone card in Spain. thanksApple iPod touch 8GB (4th Generation) - Black - Current Version
5	1322092800	I've own iPods since 2004 and I can tell you that this iPod Touch 4th generation is the best device on the market. The interface is super friendly and the free apps that you can put in it are getting even better every day. If you want you can use it to run your business or to update your Facebook status... is that simple
5	1322006400	I was very pleased and have had not problems since the day it arrived, which about a month ago. Thank you!
5	1322006400	The Ipod arrived fast.  The seller was everything I expected.  Haven't tried it yet as it is a Christmas present, but I know my daughter will love it.  Thank you!
5	1322006400	The way Apple packed the iPod in its plastic box was weird.  The older models had the hard plastic hold it in much better.  This time they just used the static plastic to hold it down.  It's okay I guess, but I liked the old way they packed it.Anyway, I read some of the reviews and GLAD I did, because it said the software update 5.01 had issues.  I thought something was wrong with the Ipod before.  There were a lot of glitches and it kept returning back to my home screen while browsing the internet on it... so I had returned it and just got the replacement today of the same model.  So, THIS time, I didn't download the software update 5.01 and so far it works just fine.  Maybe I'll wait until they improve on future software updates to download them into the ipod...???  But love it.  The pictures seem much more sharper and more vivid.  I don't know if it's just me or not.  It just looks better.  Yummy-looking iPod ;-))))))))))))))) Thanks Apple and Amazon! ;-)))))))))))))))))))
5	1321920000	I own this and it is the best product available, hands down. Don't compare it to Amazon or Samsung, it's much better
4	1321920000	Item was as represented, was shipped timely and in good condition. We bought this for use with an ihome we already had, for background music in the dining room of our nursing home.  Ipod works well with the ihome, and we were able to download all the music without problems.
5	1321488000	The sound quality is really amazing. It has a responsive touch screen, and the retina display is so much better than any phone or MP3 device, I've ever played with.
5	1321488000	Definitivamente enamorada de este producto ! Facil de usar, miles de aplicaciones ! no la cambio por nada ! una belleza de producto lo recomiendo 100 p0r ciento
5	1321401600	okay this product is awesome but i do recremend a bigger gb for u tho. about 2 of the gigs r already taken from already installed apple products that can't be removed.
4	1321315200	I do really like my ipod touch except for one thing.......battery life is too short.  This has a lot of capabilities....great for photos, songs, surfing the net and many other. The resolution is awesome, very portable.
5	1321315200	i bought this ipod for my wife as an early christmas gift, she doesnt know about it so this will be a big surprise for her. i got the product very quickly, very satisfied, thanks amazon!
5	1321228800	I have never owned any Apple products before, and when I saw the new white iPod touch being released, I had to get it.First, the price is great. Can't beat it. Cheaper than buying directly from Apple or any other online retailer that I stumbled upon. The shipping was fast as well from Amazon, and they shipped (free) directly to my PO Box. Double thumbs up for that!Now to the actual product. I love love love it. I love all the features, apps, web, wifi, messaging, etc. So easy to set up and start using. I highly recommend it!No cons yet, everything has been running smoothly!
4	1321228800	My kids love the ipod 4th gen. Here is the problem. We did not get a case at the same time we bought the ipod's.  My son cracked the glass in 3 days and my daughter on the day I got the cases. Durability is not good on these as the glass is so thin!  If you DROP YOUR IPOD WITHOUT IT BEING IN A CASE IT WILL CRACK THE GLASS! My husband is very handy so I bought the replacement glass on Amazon with kit to repair.  My husband fixed the ipod's but it took a couple of hours!  As a parent to any other parent buying this for your child please learn from my mistake! We had Zune's previous to the ipod's and never had a problem after dropping them.  The ipod is lots of fun but not durable for kids if not in a case protecting it!  Good luck!
5	1320883200	Luv it!Works great!  Great for the price!  I use it all the time.  It holds lots of pics and songs.  Hav ent used all the other apps yet, but intend to upon getting wifi.
5	1320710400	ESTOY SATISFECHO CON ESTA COMPRA, PENSE QUE EL PRODUCTO IBA A TARDAR EN LLEGAR PERO LLEGO A BUENA HORA EXCELENTE!!!
4	1320710400	i bought one of these from a department store, it has many useful functionsPros: wifi access, loads of apps(from alarm clocks to watching tv shows), good games, nice quality screen,8gb is alot of memory if you use it regularly but not every second of every day, the music playing ability is excellent, it is very reasonably priced for how good it is and how much stuff it can doCons: Lets face the facts on this device it is a good deal but it has its weaknesses. Poor battery life(4 hours of video is as much as my laptop)but if you have the screen off and playing music it might last 2 days on a charge. The major problem i have with the ipod touch 4th generation is the lack of a power button, once its turned on it never is off, it only has 4 buttons on it : home screen, volume up, volume down, and sleep. This need to have a button to shut it off so if you don't use it everyday it go flat/ if you have the wifi on and put it on sleep with no music playing it will go flat in 3 days even if it is fully charged, not good idea if you only use it once or twice a week. Also there is no wall outlet ac adapter in the box its only a usb, which works but a usb to ac wall outlet adapter is $30 if you buy it from apple which is a bit much.
4	1320710400	Easy setup, fun to use. Surprisingly some of the apps get hung often, though they were third party apps. Have not used the new operating system enough to give an opinion.
5	1320624000	this is so awesome the best purchase i have ever made love it so much its so amazingi really reccomend
5	1320537600	it was all ok, the product was perfect ,, the shipment was in the estimated time, i have nothing negative to say about this
5	1320537600	This has been a nice gift for my granddaughter. She is enjoying very much. Listening to music and photos. She is finding it very easy to use.Edit, 11/29/2012: Granddaughter still loves her ipod after over a year of use.
3	1320537600	When I purchased the Apple IPod Touch (4th Generation) I was told that it would hold 2000 songs.  What a joke.  I only use it for music.  I maxed out at 995 songs.  Very disappointed with the info I had received.  If I could have received 2000 songs, I would have highly recommended this item.  If anyone was thinking of purchasing this item, I would strongely suggest going with at least 32 GB.Apple iPod touch 8GB (4th Generation) - Black - Current Version
4	1320537600	I bouight this for my daughter's 11th birthday. She loves the app features, it makes her feel like she has her own smart phone. Our only dislike is that the ear buds that came with the product did not work. They were useless to us, but it was too much of a hassle to ship the whole product back over broken ear buds.
5	1320537600	I bought this for my 11 year old daughter. I didn't realize that we needed a credit card/itunes card in order to download any apps (including the free ones) so I went and bought an itunes card the next day and everything was great.  If you are not familiar with itunes or apple products, it can be a little confusing getting it all set up. After some trial and error, I got all of her music moved over from her old mp3 player. Once you learn how to operate it, it's great. It was well worth the money. She loved it.  JUST MAKE SURE IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR CHILD HAVING ACCESS TO YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER FOR PURCHASES, GET AN ITUNES CARD. They didn't even charge me tax at Wal-Mart when I purchased it.
5	1320451200	Great product! Works amazing! It will be even better when I actually put music on it!!!! I use it for amazing apps, and internet!
5	1320364800	My Ipod touch has become my most reliable personal assistant I keep personal notes, to do lists, weather reports, birthdays,  and many other things on it. One of my recent happy discoveries is that I can download audio books from my public library for my evening walk. It fits in my pocket and that's one of the things I like best. Actually this review isn't from a brand new user, but a 2nd time buyer. Last summer on a lengthy RV trip that my wife and I took, another person in the RV park where we were staying was trying to get into the laundry room and couldn't remember the combination for the door. No problem I told her, I've got it right here in my Ipod. As I pulled it from my pocket, I dropped it on the concrete floor and broke the screen.  I got on the internet and bought a replacement screen and digitizer, thinking I could fix it myself. I learned quickly that was about like me thinking I could perform brain surgery. So I bought this to replace my broken one and I hope I don't drop it again, but if I do I'll buy another one. I love this thing and the only "con" I can think of is the glass screen, but that's not enough to keep me from giving it 5 stars.
5	1320364800	I bought this for my sister and she loves it! It was a great Chrismas gift and she uses it all the time where ever she goes.  It is great because it does more than you think :)
5	1320364800	I love my iPod Touch.  I don't say that about many inanimate things.  There are a lot of obvious things to love about it.  The touch screen is beautiful and responsive.  The addition of a mic to this model was a stroke of brilliance.  I love using Dragon to take dictation.  I also love the flexibility afforded by the addition of a two-sided camera, and video to the mix.  On its own the camera is a bit shoddy - but enhanced with and HDR app, it becomes a powerful and unique tool for creating photos.  My iPod pictures have given me back my love of snapshots!  I won't mention the terrific capabilities for writing and editing, making movies (iMovie is grand) and the already reliable and powerful iTunes.  I want to jump forward to my favorite thing, the thing about the iPod that makes me love it rather than just liking it.What I love is the addition of a speaker.  You laugh!  Of course, we have all grown accustomed to headphones, or hi quality stereo components.  Those are grand things in the right setting.  But the new iPod touch has given me back something that I didn't even realize I was missing until I recognized it in my iPod.  What I've rediscovered is my old transistor radio.  I remember when I was a kid that the greatest invention in the world was the transistor radio.  It could go anywhere with you.  You could listen privately with an earphone, or you could share it with your friends drawing them close to listen near the lowfi speaker.  I remember standing around at school listening to the latest Dylan, Beatles or Moody Blues tune on that little thing.  We discovered more music on our little transistor radios than anyplace else.  Its not the same when you have to pass headphones back and forth.  I like sitting with the iPod in my pocket to listen to new albums, play audiobooks or podcasts.  I like turning the volume up and getting my friends in close to listen to great songs - almost in secret, but not quite - even so we can all listen at once.Treat yourself this year - please your inner child.  Get one of these and use the heck out of it!
5	1320278400	Apple continues its trend of creating the best multi-touch experience around.Faster 1GHz A4 Processor - to keep up with the high demands of multitasking.
4	1320278400	The iPod came in the condition stated and it worked perfectly fine. The only problem is that I dropped it about two weeks ago and it landed on the corner and the screen cracked. Unfortunately, Apple wouldn't replace it for free and wanted to charge me $100. I would definitely recommend buying a case because the same thing happened to my brother.
3	1320278400	I got this at christmas time 2010 - the screen distorts (common problem in all the ipod touchs) - the mic needs to be cleaned from lint or dust after 3-4 months - the customer service for apple is poor you only get 1 phone call to them per ipod unless you pay a whopping 60 dollars a year which is obviously not worth it - its to slim and gets damaged easily - everything is overcharged at the apple store - ull see a hard case for $30 at the apple store and find the same exact one on amazon for MAYBE $2 usually less.
5	1320192000	The Ipod was received in perfect conditions.It was delivered on time, and it works great!thank you very much.
4	1320192000	Had my iTouch for about a month now. Love it. Love all the apps. Life just got easier and I wondered what I did without it. I do wish the camera and camera roll interfaced with FB and other apps. Highly recommend this to folks of all ages. I am now more in tuned with news, tracking my spending health, shopping and to-do lists, and staying more connected with friends. Had my iTouch for about a month now. Love it. Love all the apps.

5	1320192000	I'm thrilled with my Ipod Touch.....it does amazing and remarkable things! Wish the battery stayed charged just a little longer, 'cause I hate to put it down to charge it. Could NOT be happier! THANK YOU FAMILY.
5	1320105600	Why is the iPod White version cheaper than the same one on the Apple Store? Is there something missing on the Amazon one? Or is it used or refurbished?
1	1320105600	This in general was a very nice device, but because of the recent Apple Update to IOS 5 and all the hype around the Apple here are the problems that I have with itand I give it 1 Star, because Apple is pulling my leg with IOS 5:1. IOS 5 makes it extremely slow and therefore almost useless, why do I have to wait for everything now ?2. No downgrade via Apple to the old version possible, so I am stuck3. Battery life is very short after 12 months and battery can not be changed4. Rear camera is just bad and useless for photos - come on Apple, can't you do better ?5. The rear surfaces scratched within 2 days
5	1320019200	I was wondering if I should buy a used iPod, but it really was a nice choice! The delivery was very fast, and condition was very nice. Free case came with the product so I was pleasantly surprised. If you are looking for a used iPod at Amazon, I think it's really a good choice.
5	1320019200	As a longtime mac user who uses Apple computers daily I found the iPod Touch and iOS5 to be really refreshing for a jaded user like myself. I didn't actually decide to buy this until my girlfriend purchased a white 32 gb model on a whim and decided it wasn't for her. I decided to just buy it off of her since my iPod is 5 years old now, and it would be nice to test websites I design on the iOS platform. I actually have never really even used any iOS device. I could never justify the monthly cost of an iPhone and was always content with my machines (a 15" i7 mbp, and a MacPro at work) and a scroll wheel iPod for my music/podcasting needs.Skimming over the specs before she purchased it I was pretty amazed at how much was packed in it. Front and back cameras, HD video recording, Retina display, Powerful processor, FaceTime, etc (we all know the specs). And after spending a week buried in it I'm completely in love with it. It's completely changed my view on mobile devices and now I know why all my friends seem to always have their noses buried in an iPhone.The first thing I did was integrate the iPod through iCloud. Well actually I didn't have to do anything besides enter my Apple ID. My gmail account was added automatically. All of my calendars, reminders, notes, contacts, bookmarks, reading list, EVERYTHING was synced automatically. And continues to be synced through my wifi connection.After I tidied up my music collection I did the initial sync with the iPod plugged in to my Macbook because syncing a lot/or large files over wifi can take a bit of time. But now I don't even plug it in to sync- if I download a new podcast, make a new playlist, change song ratings, add or remove an album/songs, etc I can just sync the touch over my wifi connection. Gone are the days where I had to run out to the car- get the iPod, come back in, find the plug, and then plug it in to sync. This morning when I was sitting in the driveway I still had a very strong connection to my network thanks to the built in 802.11n and I realized that if my computer was still on I could sync right there from the driveway. Very cool since my gf and I are podcast addicts and are always syncing once or twice a week to get the latest ones before we hit the road.The addition of iCloud and iOS5 (both free) has been made my life a lot easier. If I'm surfing the web on the touch I'll just add an article to my reading list. Later on at work I can pick up right where I left off on the article. Add an event to my calendar at work and it's there on the touch. Make a shopping list as a note on my macbook and when we're at the grocery store I just use the touch as my shopping list. Made a reminder a few days ago to wash my car and once it's done I check the reminder off on the touch. While typing this review I had an iCal alert on my MacPro and on the Touch (which isn't even connected to wifi at the moment) pop up at the same exact time. It's amazing.Now to the part that surprised me the most- Apps. Like I said I've never really used iOS before and I've always had mixed feelings towards smartphones and the whole "app" thing but after spending a weekend digging around for apps I'm a changed man. The majority of my favorite ones were free and for services I use regularly- banking, lynda.com, Facebook, craigslist, mint.com. And not only that but they made certain things like paying bills or managing my finances a lot more fun and convenient. Using an app instead on the touch has essentially freed me from having to sit behind the computer and browser- something I do for hours a day for work. It's become something completely new and different. Our favorite app has to be the free iTunes controller from apple. We usually have a computer plugged in playing music off of iTunes and now we can control it from the anywhere in the house with the Touch. Even while using iTunes on my girlfriend's PC with windows 7 it works flawlessly.For movies/netflix we usually have my macbook connected directly to the HD LCD tv. I found an app that lets me control the macbook from bed and can control the built in dvd program. The app also lets the surface of the touch act as an external trackpad for the macbook. Best $5 app ever.And lastly as a music player I love it so much more than the touch wheel operated iPods. This is coming from someone who usually prefers something tactile over a touch screen. Navigating through your music/playlists/podcasts is easier than ever on the iPod touch. You can even delete artists/albums/tracks off of the touch in iOS5 now. In my car I used to control my iPod through the head unit and I decided to use the line out and get a mount for the touch so I can use it directly instead of trying to navigate the iPod through a car stereo Head unit.Overall I'm just amazed at how powerful this little device is and how easily it integrates into my life. For work it's the perfect organizer. At home it adds a ton of convenience. On the road it serves us endless entertainment. Hat's off to Apple for this one.
4	1320019200	Great device to do all kinds of interesting things with.  All the fun of the iPhone without the pesky cell phone plan.  Wish it had a slightly better camera.
5	1320019200	To be honest, after all, color is not a problem at all. At the end this is a great product, and color is not an issue at this time.
4	1320019200	The I pod touch has lots of nice features like email, calendar, stock quotes, and a fine camera, but what I care about is being able to access lots of documents, and it is remarkably clumsy in that regard.
5	1319932800	the white ipod touch is amazing i have the black ipod touch as well but the white one shows finger prints less and the screen looks brighter buy the white version you wont regret it
5	1319846400	good thing but apple reduce the price to$199 after i bought it.anyway,the items from apple is alway so perfect.as for my money? oh my lady gaga.
5	1319846400	I ordered this item yesterday for my husband's birthday that's this weekend & I recevied it today.  It came fully sealed, protected & clean.  Can't wait to see my husband's face this weekend when he gets it.Apple iPod touch 8GB (4th Generation) - Black - Current Version
5	1319846400	The Kindle Fire has PWA2 protection, .DOCX, .MIDI, Cloud support, 7" screen, and actually works with Amazon Video on Demand so all those episodes you bought on Amazon aren't sitting in a dumpster.  So why should you buy an iPod Touch?I had previously owned a 1 gigabyte iPod Nano for about 5-6 years, which got sacked when the iHome music player/dock died.  I wanted something that could avoid the same fate, so I picked the multipurpose iPod Touch.  It doesn't need headphones or a dock and plays my 5000 songs, 3 digital copies of movies, and ~80 games.  Unfortunately it is now full, so go for a 64GB one if you're a weekend warrior.  Here's what I use it for:1. Netflix.  Excellent resolution!  It looks about the same quality as aw TV ten times that size.  I watch Netflix on the Wii and have roughly the same experience.2. Kindle reading app.  It works better than my Kindle is some ways because books can be deleted and browsed quicker.  Also the progress bar appears when downloading.  However there are fewer and smaller words per page, so I'm keeping my Kindle.3. Pandora radio.  I never heard of this before. I watch the Disney Radio station and love it.  Haven't tried the thousands of other stations but only had this for a week.4.  Toddler apps.  Thanks to the touch screen, this functions as a Leapfrog Reader in some sense and my toddler can interact with extremely simple games, purchasable from the iTunes store, such as "touch the rainbow."5. Music.  It plays music video for 2 bucks each or songs for a dollar or more.  It's a lot but you have them forever and will forget about the price eventually.So basically it does everything that the Amazon Fire could do, except it plays iTunes movies or copied digital copy movie disks.  A big warning - Audible books can take up 100's of megs for each novel, so to take 100's of hours of audiobooks on the go, this is the only way.  It's also less than a pound, just like the Kindle, so you can use it with arthritis.  If you're getting this for grandma and her eyes are bad, consider getting her the Audible bundle for 100 dollars less (minus the 15 bucks a month fee so it's actually 80 dollars more) and for goodness sakes stop giving her books for Christmas because she can only read large print.I bought an Otterbox,OtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPod touch 4th Generation (Blue/White), because I've had horrible experiences for breaking things, and Otterbox is supposed to be the best.  Hasn't broken yet so 5 stars.
5	1319760000	I have owed a ZEN for several years, but after joining the gym it was a little bulky/heavy to strap on my arm. I have never owned an Apple product but have heard rave reviews.All I can say is WOW!! This is light weight and thin. Very easy to navigate and use.My kids and I have already downloaded tons of apps!! My younger daughter is always talking face to face with her friend using the Face Time app.I also like the voice command to change my music selections and possibly more  I still have not had the time to play with all the gadgets!! I would recommend this product to anyone (I have already purchased two more for my kids so they can leave mine alone!!)
4	1319760000	It was the same product listed on Apple's website and on eBay but cheaper on Amazon.  I will check Amazon first next time.
4	1319587200	Even though this is an 8GB unit, the actual usable space is only 6.5GB, which was a surprise (and disappointment).  Although I planned to use this iPod primarily for music there were just a few apps I had hoped to load also, but by the time I got my music (about 700 songs) onto it I was almost completely out of room.  Loading the music from iTunes is a little tricky until you get used to it, and the on-line manual doesn't tell you everything so you kind of learn some of it as you go along: for instance, if I created a playlist but did not save at least one song to it before connecting to iTunes, that playlist would be erased.  I like the calendar feature a lot.  I haven't used the camera feature yet and I don't have wireless at home so there are a number of things I have yet to try.  I can say for certain that the earphones that come with it are not very good; I've already purchased replacements.  In all, I think my only regret was that I didn't go for the 32GB.
5	1319587200	this ipod touch is so really good ... i get to listen to music while im texting or even surfing the web.
4	1319587200	A great device for the fun of the whole family. Delight the kids up from their elders. A great choice for this.
5	1319500800	Well, its exactly what it was supposed to be. And does exactly what its supposed to do. So I guess it was exactly what I wanted.
5	1319500800	please send me the serial no of my ipod ,,, its really nice , and somedody stole it , so i can trace with my co employee ,, to identify it , only with my serial no , pls help , thanks so much .. nina bugarin
5	1319500800	I don't like Apple, but the iPod Touch & iPhone are the only products of theirs that I like. The iPod Touch is really good if you like to do a variety of things like, social networking, games, music, surf the internet, etc. I also got this to text and call people, using an app. I find the iPod Touch to be very useful in some cases. Hopefully, when I have a job, I'll save up to get an iPhone 4S. Haha. Anyways, good product, it's worth the price; it's cheaper now, so that's even better.
5	1319414400	The selection of apps and the great ios software is just too hard to beat, this device is still a game changer, only for android to catch up.
4	1319414400	super cool, I can't stop recommending it to my friends and family, I especially love the facetime just dislike the fact that I need wifi in order to use the facetime and other features...I mean wifi isn't everywhere
5	1319328000	Arrived in an unopened new package. Just as described. used but "New" the price was right. I did a lot of shopping prior to purchasing this one. Thank you.
5	1319328000	I love my iPod touch. I'm using it to write this. I can't justify spending a lot of money each month for IPhone plans and I'm around wifi most of my day, so the iPod gives me almost everything I want from a smartphone without the heavy monthly cost.
4	1319241600	What's to say?  Not a single new feature in over a year except now in white. Would it have been asking too much from  Apple to improve the processor or camera?  I wish I could get an answer, but I suspect it comes down to profit.Having said that, it's a lot better than my daughter's current  iPod touch 3rd generation with a cracked screen and worn out battery.  She will be very happy with her new white ipod touch.
1	1319155200	I got this iPod for myself and when i got home hooked it up to my PC, iTunes recognized it and everything went well. I put some music and a short test video on it and tested it out a bit, Worked great and i loved it. now if it would have stayed that simple i would have been the most satisfied customer ever. Later on i tried to move some more music to the iPod, plugged it in and nothing...my computer recognized there was a device but iTunes didn't. Soon after i realized there was a problem i looked all over on the internet trying to find a solution. Apple customer support gave me the standard "Make sure all cords are connected properly" and "Download the latest version of iTunes" which I've had since the start. Apple never went into any more solutions with their best being re-install iTunes. I spent hours looking at similar problems on user help forums but its apparently such a common problem there could be hundreds of different solutions. I ended up sending it back for a full refund and won't ever touch another Apple product again. It might have been different if i had a Mac but i would think it should work just as well on both platforms. Save your money for something else.
5	1319155200	This is a great product for us!  It allowed us to get rid of a phone with an expensive data package, but still be able to use all of the same apps & more
4	1318982400	Ipod touch 4G is as good as the Iphone, except the calling function, whatsapp, and also poorer camera pixel. Overall, a good product which is small to carry around.
5	1318982400	UMMMMM....I Luv This IPod It Has A Freggin Fone I Love How I Dont Have To Pay A Stupid Fone Bill And My Friends Can Still Talk To Me!!
5	1318982400	I absolutly love it!!!! I had a generation 2 and just recently got a generation 4 and it is amazing!!!! I am able to have so much fun with it. Not only can I do all my online stuff I totally love the 2 cameras!!!! I am so happy I got this there is so much more I can do now!!
3	1318982400	I got this guy last xmas from my SIL.  At first I though it was a great device.  Numerous apps made it as functional as an organizational tool/ personal assistant as an mp3 player (more so, as the mp3 player sucks).I made the mistake of using it too much, I carried it w/ me without a protective case, and the idiot who decided to build the case out of smooth stainless bit me in the butt.  Since the 'mirror like finish' is so smooth, and wrapped around the entire device, it slides off EVERYTHING that isn't perfectly level.  It even would slip out of my fingers unless they were gripping it (no 'touch' holding!).Inevitably, it slipped out of a shirt pocket while I was bent down and hit (edge on) the garage floor from a lofty altitude of about 2' (I was bent over), it dented (slightly!) the stainless at the edge, which shattered the screen.  well, crap.  I knew it was slippery and slidey (thanks idiot apple engineers!), and so, as upset as I was, I couldn't blame anybody else for NOT already owning a protective case (something that I'd been planning on doing).So I start to research replacing the glass + digitizer (I figure it's worth it)...  Well, thats a $100 piece of glass since, in the latest version, the idiot apple engineers thought it'd be a great idea to bond the glass + digitzer + LCD panel(!!!). WhatTheHeck?!? Why?Bottom line?  It's a great, fun, pretty, adaptable, device.  Just not durable (at all!), and ridiculously slippery and slidey(!) - so if you get it for your kid BUY A COVER!!, if you get it for yourself BUY A COVER!!Oh, and, BTW, if you ONLY plan on listening to music/radio/stuff on it (not utilizing the myriad other apps) get another device, the music player sucks (though it is pretty), and it doesn't even have an FM tuner *rolling eyes*.  I think of it now as a mini-ipad, and maybe that's what apple built it for...
5	1318896000	This is probably the most advanced piece of technology made by Apple. Essentially, this is the Ipad 2 - except it actually fits in your pocket. The white version is significantly better than the black one, because the black version is more scratch-prone (all scratches are visible on the black version). The white version is more stylish and has less scratch visibility. This is an exceptional product, it beats anything made by Microsoft (Zune), Droid, or HTC. The high definition retina display is astounding, the games play so much better than the PSP-3000 (I own one and I can see the difference.) This is a perfect gift or self indulgence gadget. The plethora of high quality free apps (over 500,000) is also a huge bonus. This white ipod touch is the best thing made by Apple - it is slimmer than the 3rd generation ipod touch, the screen and lighting is better, the programming is more advanced, you can text other ipod touch owners for free, 720p HD camera, etc..... It is essentially the Iphone 4S without the "calling ability" and the high monthly phone service fees. This is the product to get!!! Now go out there and get a WHITE one - I promise you will be cooler than all those who have the old generic black one. :)
5	1318809600	My son is in love with his new iPod. It is all that he expected and more. I am seriously considering getting one for myself.
5	1318636800	One of the coolest ipod i have ever had, and the camera is just amazing but only at daylight, wish it would be better at night time..!
5	1318636800	muy buena la atencion, el servicio.. amazon 100% confiable y responsable. el item llego en perfectas condiciones y con los tiempos de entrega pactados. no tengo queja alguna. hasta el momento todo funciona muy bien.
4	1318636800	when i bought this item it wasnt suspost to come in till the 19 of september but it came on the 15 of september so shiping wise i was very happy. the conditon was all good exsept on the top there were marks on it like someone was trying to cut though it with a knife the marks were very deep to. other than tht this was a great deal!!! i would highly reconmend this user
5	1318636800	I bought this for my 7 year old daughter for her  birthday, and she LOVES it!  Now her older sister is saving up so she can get the newer version.
5	1318550400	The ipod was a birthday gift for our 14 year old daughter -- she is thrilled with the product.  I was nervous after reading the pros and cons, but teenagers usually know what they want, and the "cons" were not enough to disuade her.  Thanks for a good service.  Amazon is definitely my "go to" online shopping site.
4	1318550400	My daughter bought this with her birthday money and she loved the features, but. In one day of having it dropped it and the screen broke.  We called around to see how much it was to fix it and it was going to be $120.
5	1318550400	Excellent just as described. Item came and was perfect. Super fast shipper. No scratches on device at all. Great product as if it was brand new.
4	1318464000	I absolutely LOVE my iPod Touch. I usually do not purchase expensive electronic devices.  I never thought the cost was worth it. So, I bought your cheap mp3 players... and discounted items. After I found out I was going to deploy I slowly began to change my mind about purchasing an Ipod Touch.  After reading the reviews on Amazon and the products specs on the Apple web site, I was hooked. I had to have this item! I ended up using my iPod for EVERYTHING. It was my computer, my phone, my mp3 player, my TV and my alarm clock. I even used it to time my strengthen training sessions at the gym. This has become a staple in my everyday life!
4	1318377600	why is amazon trying to sell this product for $256 when apple.com had them for the same price as the black version? $199
5	1318291200	I purchased this for my husband who likes to play on my phone but refuses to use a cell phone.  So to keep him away from mine, I purchased this it is perfect for him. He loves the games, and some of the free apps.  So happy that I decided to purchase it.
4	1318291200	The battery life is great and allows you to play games all day long.  The free apps are a lot of fun.
5	1318204800	the product is in excellent condition. It was delivered right away. I neven have problem with amazon.the time I ordered the product, they mentioned that there's some scratches but when I recieved it, I found no scratches. I am very happy with it.
5	1318204800	Arrived promptly, earlier than expected, in excellent, brand new condition. Works great!! More than happy with this purchase and have already purchased another one plus a Kindle 3G because of the great service.
3	1318118400	nice features, very intuitive and not so difficult to operate. i finally got one and i see what all of the hype is about
2	1318118400	Unfortunately the location services aren't nearly as good as the previous generation so there are lots of times when you need a map and you end up in the UK (I'm in the Seattle area).  Newer apps work (less the location issue) but I wish I had just kept my older I touch.  Definitely not worth the $$
3	1318118400	So a switch must be made because it's white!  Different color plastic!This is just a cult, isn't it?  C'mon, you can tell us the truth.For those who'd actually like to listen to music in very high (instead of mediocre) quality, check out the Cowon J3.
5	1318032000	I got the item in November 2010 and it has lived up to my every expectations and more. The quality work that apple put in this little thing is just amazing. Every application works perfect with absolutely no glitches and i have been walking with this thing every day from Nov. 2010 till now...The picture quality is great and blows your mind each time you play a game or even look at a pic.I really could go on and on but every sentence i type would have the word amazing in it. so to cut it short i will talk about the Cons of the ipod 4Gen. IT HAS NONE!! seriously i found none.I am now seriously thinking about buying an Apple Note Book because of how smooth it transitions between apps.great buy
5	1317945600	Gracias por el excelente producto me encanto, funciona de maravilla perfecto. Es super accesible en costo y en perfectas condiciones...
5	1317945600	One month ago I bought it to my wife as a birthday present. Now she use it for email and entertainment every day.
4	1317945600	First, let me say that any hardware is only as good as the content. Apple has an abundance of great content. But Apple products are also designed with care and excellence and the iPod Touch 4th Generation is no exception. I am not going into detail. As I write this there are well over 2,000 reviews and I simply can't add much to be helpful.The iPod and the iPad are so close to the same thing. I have them both and have many of the same apps on them both. I do not use my iPod as a music player but more as a personal assistant. It has replaced my old, faithful Palm. I like the Touch because I can carry it with me whereas the iPod is a bit big to carry around from place to place. I also use the Touch as a phone. I have Google Voice on it and also Skype.I really love the iPod Touch. I got 32GB and feel it's more than enough memory for me. It's easy to use. It's fun and I highly recommend it.There is one thing I dislike about it, however. The battery life is not good. I often have to charge it two or three times a day. That doesn't mean it  drains totally out each time but it gets low. I hope that's improved in the future.-- Susanna K. Hutcheson
5	1317859200	This was a gift, and it was a home run for a present. I am very pleased that everything seems to be working the way it should. Thank You, Amazon
5	1317859200	have facetime and games and all apps I like in my iphone. I leave it at home and use it like a phone as my wifi is always on. good deal!
5	1317772800	I bought this for my 16 year old sister cause I thought for her age she deserved one. When it finally came in wow did she fall in love with it! It's great it's just like my iphone with it's camera in the front and back except that the camera for the iphone is clearer. This is pretty cheap compared to buying it at the store and I've got 6 months to pay it off so it's something I'd like to call great quality and great pricing. Totally worth it.
4	1317772800	Amazon is the best. Fast response best seller and great tacking care of there custermers.These people "rock"  and the Apple iPod touch 8 GB (4th Generation) NEWEST MODEL is by far the best gadget Ever try it you will love it ........
3	1317772800	Apple released the iPod touch 4th generation over 1 year ago and a white front is all that has changed. It has been has been over a year and there are absolutely no hard ware changes. The iPhone however has received a major hardware up grade such as the 8mp camera and the a5 dual core  processor. Even though the it has been over a year and the iPhone has been majorly upgraded iPod touch users are stuck with the a4 processor and the crappy .7 mp camera. I have had my iPod touch 4th generation since it came out and have been very pleased with it so when apple decides to do a real update I will be glad to buy it.
5	1317686400	I had a 16G Ipod before but after dropping it on the patio I cracked the screen pretty good. I'm not big on apps, I play a game for a while then delete it when I get bored with it and only have a few hundred songs so getting a smaller one worked for me. I love that they have a camera and face time and stuff on there now.
5	1317600000	Received the item quickly and packed securely. Looked like new and my grandson was elated. I would recommend this to anyone looking to save money and get an I-pod that even has a warranty.
4	1317513600	While the product is an Apple and lives up to the standards of Apple, my disappoint falls on the shipper. It took almost two (2) weeks for it to arrive and there was NO "Users Manual" in the package. I have had to go on-line to try to find out how to use it.I am happy with the product but NOT happy with Amazon.
5	1317513600	My daughter really wanted an iPod touch, and the price was prohibitive locally.  Found a brand new one for a good price, and it was exactly as promised.  She was ecstatic!  Thank you!
5	1317513600	This product by far is the best I've used of it's type. Great for music, video's, photo's, games and more. The new high res screen is unbelievable. I highly recommend this product for your media needs.
5	1317427200	I was able to get this ipod touch through my warranty with Best Buy, after my 3rd generation failed on me. The guy that worked there gave me this new one for free, although my warranty expired (which was nice of him). I love the fact that it has a camera :). I ended up cracking the screen a little bit on the right corner of it, since it fell. So YOU MUST BUY A COVER FOR THIS since the screen is made of glass. Overall, great product. I wouldn't recommend going over 8GB if you are only going to use it for music (which is what I use it for mainly).
5	1317427200	Bought this for my 8 year old's birthday! Very user friendly for kids, holds up great too (the otterbox helps)!
5	1317340800	My first iPod touch. This is truly a gift of the Gods. I hooked my ipod up to my radio system and it sounds great.
5	1317254400	This is a great product. Have bought several in the past, kids are intent on losing them so I can spend more money. Will buy again.....soon probably!
5	1317254400	My children are determined to drag me kicking and screaming into the electronic age so they got this for me as a birthday gift.  At first I didn't want to deal with learning a "new thing" - I had just figured out how to work my TV remote and I was exhausted.  So I left it in the box.  When I finally did take it out, I discovered that (a) its operation is intuitive - so I didn't have to struggle to figure it out; and (b) it works like my ipad only smaller (c) I can take it with me and play Angry Birds ANYWHERE.I won't bore you with talk of the technical wonderful-ness of this product, mostly because I am most un-qualified to write about such things.  But I can tell you that Ipod + Spotify = AMAZING.  I can now download a playlist from Spotify to my Ipod and through some sort of magic and/or voodoo make it available off line which enables me to listen to my music without an internet connection.  Good-bye I-tunes!!!I love this gizmo, I don't know how I lived without it.
5	1317168000	The ipod touch 4g. Well I have to say that this is an awesome device I'm going to list the pros and cons and in the middles.ProsGaming- one of the best gaming devices out there, games on the app store are dirt cheap and you can get about any game you want.Sound quality (with headphones on) The sound quality is pretty darn good. It's very loud with headphones on, which is a good thing.A4 processor- really fast (if your like me) I have a nintendo 3ds and the speed is phenomonal(comparing to the 3ds)Applications- if you don't already know they have applications for just about anything. There dirt cheap too, some are even free!!Features- the preloaded apps (for ios 4.3.5 or something like that) are good even though I haven't tried out facetime yet I think it will be good. Here are the preloaded apps. Facetime, Calendar, photos, Camera, youtube, stocks, maps, weather,clock, calculator, voice memos, notes,itunes, app store, game center, contacts, settings, music, mail, safari, videos.Screen quality- amazing quality for just about everything,In the middlesMovies- Good quality and quick loading but they take up a lot of space.Camera quality- Not so high there but if your in good light it's good.ConsBattery life- not so goodSpeaker quality- can get blocked easily, just reccomend putting earbuds or headphones on.Now we're at size capacity and which one you should get.I don't think it really matters what size you get because you can delete stuff you don't want and put new stuff on . I chose 8gb and I'm satisfied.SummaryOverall I think its pretty darn good there's not really much to say just amazing.
5	1317168000	The iPod touch is a beautiful, easy to use and learn tool that enhances ones ability to not only enjoy  music & videos, but to use it as a mini iPad with apps galore. While small in size, it is powerful and fast. Great upgrade.
5	1316995200	You can use it any place there's Wi-Fi,review e-mail,text, listen to music,watch news, takes videos and pictures free apps. I travel a lot so it's very convenient I can use it anywhere without being tied to a contract. No calls though, but other features keep you well connected
5	1316995200	iPod touch is technically a small version of the iPad. It is the FIRST TABLET in my opinion... well the first tablet that did things right. Of courser this all started with the first few generations, not this one of course. All in all, this iPod has the functionality (cameras, thickness, battery life) that one would expect for paying a high price tag.I use it as my:iPod music playerfor gamesfor skypecool photo apps like photofx and instagram / hipstomaticweb browsingmemo padthe list goes onIn my opinion, this is a gadget that worth your money. Android devices are making a strong case for themselves, but for ow this probably the best.
5	1316908800	I gave it to my son for his 14th birthday. I guess he loves it since we don't talk anymore because he always has his ear-buds in listening to his music. It also works great as a motivational tool for homework and chores.
5	1316736000	All I have say about this product is that I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!!!  I have nothing bad to say about my new ipod except that I can't seem to put it down!! :) Really enjoy listening to my music where ever I go or accessing my emails!!! Great product!!!
5	1316649600	I have the old style iPod, this new one I purchased for my wife, think I will upgrade, the icons are great, would recommend it to a friend. It's probably worth investing in the larger memory unit, I filled up the memory pretty quicklyjohn
1	1316649600	(1) Let me start with looks because its Apple product. Backside of this ipod always looks dirty, with sweat from your hand clearly visible. Unlike the regular good quality plastic or dark color. No, I don't like to put cover or extra protection on any of my electronics devices.(2) Software sucks big time, you cannot do many things including how to manage your own music collection. When I added my film OST albums (compilation album with various artists) it will show as 20 different albums on your ipod. It can not even handle music albums with two CDs or two parts. Its pushes them into Unknown Albums. Forget about creating mixed albums from the single tracks you buy from Amazon mp3. Managing music through itunes is big pain, its over smart software that will do what it has to do.(3) The worst part, Apple will not allow you to download any of the Free apps until you register your credit card information with them. I dont understand why cant we install free apps without providing credit card information, I mean there is no option to register your apple id without credit card. Yes, I am among those poor people who have not been offered credit card yet have $2000 speakers+avr but no Pandora app installed on my ipod. :((4) Now, I have started liking my Android phone's music player.(5) Good part was that ipod touch has built-in bluetooth transmitter so I could play music wirelessly with good quality. Other than this I think I will return this product.
5	1316563200	According to my 18 year old son, he couldn't have received a better gift. He's a college freshman and loves Loves LOVES his iPod touch. I bought myself a G3 in my first year at grad school 18 months back and couldn't be happier. BUY THIS. You'll be glad you did.
5	1316563200	First of all, it's not a mp3 player. It's a really good gaming device, a perfect mp3 player, a fine camera which can take 720 videos too and very good portable computer which allows you to do video conversations, internet surf and a lot of more things
5	1316563200	ITS COOL, I DONT LIKE WRITING REVIEWS  THIS IPOD TOUCH IS SO NICE I USE IT EVERYDAY WHILE WALKING TO CLASS AND WORKING OUT ON CAMPUS
5	1316476800	Bought this for my boyfriend. This was in brand new condition for a refurbished ipod touch. Especially the pricing was very reasonable I will definitely be buying the newer one for myself! It was more than I expected and it came very quickly. Thanks!
5	1316390400	Very good product. The screen can break easy (so be careful) I have purchased 2 and am buying another. Worth the money.
4	1316390400	The Ipod works really well my oly qualm with it is that the battery does not last very long in my opinion. The 8G space is quite adequate for my needs which is mainly music files and the odd photos. No need for video clips at this present moment. I have not used most of the apps as yet, I am very pleased that it has Wi-fi access. Honestly so far I love it.
5	1316390400	This was a great gift for my daughter. She considers it one her best gifts to date. She has no complaints. The technology has met her expectations. Shes happy , wich made me happy.
5	1316304000	Bought this for my granddaughter--she loves it. Am thinking about buying 2 more for Christmas gifts.  Very pleased with this purchase.
5	1316304000	Better than expected, I did not know about FaceTime and when we tried it with my Parents iPad with FaceTime we were able talk and see each other. We use the iPod often.
5	1316217600	I was in the market for a new MP3 player to use while walking.  I originally bought the Archos 43, an Android based tablet with a 4.3" screen.  The Archos was okay but had a few problems, the biggest being the touchscreen.  I had heard good things about the Ipod touch screen so returned the Archos and got the 8GB Ipod Touch, couldn't be happier.  I got my music on the unit and downloaded some really great apps, having to use Itunes isn't so bad and I haven't had any problems. The apps are great and the touch screen is fantastic.  Really love my Ipod touch, buying from Amazon saved me $25, free shipping took a while which surprised me, Amazon used Smartpost which is like strapping the package to a snails back and hoping for the best! I forgive them though, I love Amazon and will overlook this one flaw.  Buy the Ipod touch, you will not regret it.
5	1316217600	Shipped to me smoothly and on schedule. Good looking and easy to use. Camera is cool, although picture quality is not as good as that of my Canon camera. WiFi connection is good and stable. Battery life is not very good with WiFi turned on. Overall, it's very good. Hopefully, the picture quality will get improved by the next generation iPod touch.
5	1316131200	My daughter loves this thing. She saved her money for over 6 months to buy it. Personally I think that was crazy, but she is happy and I guess that is all that matters.
1	1316131200	the ipod was fun while it lasted. 6 months after purchase the iPod broke for no reason. I'm never buying an apple product ever again!
5	1316044800	I use the iPod with my bicycle stereo.  Would dearly love to have the option to listen to the radio on long rides.
1	1316044800	wifi often does not work. so i want to refund or change new ipod, not refurbished product.tell me how can i refund or chage new thing.
5	1315958400	I've never had the nifty new gadgets that come out, but when all my friends were getting iPhones/iPod Touches, etc... I just had to have one!  I was also already in the market for an MP3 player, which I wanted an iPod for, so the decision was easy to go with the iPod Touch.  I didn't want the expense or contract of the iPhone, I have internet at home that it can hook up to already, and there are plenty of hot spots for internet around town.I got my iPod Touch, came home, set it up, and have been having an absolute blast ever since!  Checking out all the apps in the App Store, putting my music onto it.  I love love love my 4th gen iPod Touch!  One of the best things I've ever bought!
5	1315958400	Exactly what I ordered.  Arrived quicker than I expected!!  While certainly not a unique item, it was a good value and great service to go along!
5	1315872000	Great product and my son loves it.  He mostly likes its ability to text, call, and vid phone from wifi!
4	1315872000	As always a great product!  My three year old was running done the battery playing on my Iphone, so we bought him an Ipod touch.  I wish they would make the next Iphone this slim.
5	1315785600	Excellent service was exactly as described would definitely buy from them again. Can't tell difference from the one I purchased at Apple.
5	1315785600	All Good! I bought this ipod touch for my son's birthday and he has not put it down since he got it! Everything went well, from ordering, delivery and all the fun things the ipod touch has to offer! Highly recommended!
4	1315699200	My daughter loves the product, but the battery just doesn't seem to last that long (especially if she uses the camera).
5	1315526400	It wasnt for me, it is for my sis and ahe loved it, its fun, portable, thin, just what she needs.
5	1315440000	So far, I've only had a Nano 3rd Generation and an Ipod Shuffle 5th Generation.I love those two and this is my first Ipod touch purchase.  The Retina display is awesome.  I truly love Apple products.  They never let me down.  It's opened a new world with these apps.  Very cool.  I was able to get my Ipod through winning sites like Swagbucks, Gather, Beezag and Zoombucks, so I'm grateful for this truly amazing birthday present to myself.5 stars all the way!

1	1315353600	Battery battery battery... nuff said.Battery sucks... big time.Like it was embarrassing to show my friends my new toy and the stinking battery dies.Phones and Pods are just too small.Pads, siPods, nyet.A horse walks into a bar... the bartender looks up and sees him and asks... "Why the long face? Rim-shot!
5	1315353600	This is a great item, I was hesitant at first that my daughter wanted it so badly, but after her recieving it and getting it going so quickly, I am thrilled with the product. I would love to have one for myself.
5	1315353600	Thank you very muchI have received my IPod after 2 day from my orderIt is amazingExcellent serviceKeep going
5	1315267200	We bought this for our son for his birthday and he loves it! The 8 GB , is perfect for his age ( he already has 90 songs on it and 5 pages of aps and still has about 4 GB left. Even I grab and play with it every once in awhile and it's( well the higher GB) is on the top of my Christmas list!
3	1315267200	I like the iPod Touch.  This is my third one, and I still use the previous two.However, I was dismayed to hook the new one up to iTunes only to discover that the device only has 6.5 GB of useable memory.  Earlier versions had a little less than 8 GB due to operating system requirements, but usually got somewhere near 8 GB.  This new one though, with 6.5 GB...  It just seems like the advertising is misleading.  Not by a little, not something that can be explained away by operating system requirements, or rounding-up; This was just plain dishonest.It's a nice device, don't get me wrong.  It works great.  It just doesn't have what Apple said it has.
1	1315008000	This would be a great product if Apple didn't force you to use itunes to do everything. I did my research and knew about this before buying, but I didn't realize itunes would be way more difficult then the copy n' paste method. I spent hours trying to convert my whole music library and still couldn't get everything transfered. later, I invested a good hour creating a playlist on my ipod, only to have it vanish the next time I plugged it into my computer. If I so much as add one new song to my ipod, the sync process messes up what I already established. It's not enviromentally friendly. The backlight won't go off for at least a minute, which is just a terrible waste of battery power. For $200 it shouldn't be this much hassle. I sent it back for a refund. I'm sticking with Sony's Walkman. They're half the price and you don't have to deal with itunes. itunes charges the most money per song anyway.
5	1315008000	I love this i-pod. I have bought many i-pods in the past at retail stores and even paid $40 to $50 more as gifts. So, I decided I wanted one and I really love it. I don't play games or watch movies on it but, I love taking pitures and getting on line in a hurry. Every thing is right at your finger tips. You know every one these days have someing hidden in there pocket. well, now so do I. I will be buying other one as a gift for my nehew for his birthday at the end of the month. I also got a hard case for it. I love it also. I really like the custmer service amazon has. I have bought many little things from amazon. So, when I decided I wanted this item I went stright to amazon for the product. I spent $200 and I was not worried about getting ripped off because, this company is so protected.  The pricing is wonderful. The speed of shipping is not bad. I think it seems like a long time becuse, your so excited but, when I thought about it. It was really only 7 days.Thank you amazon.
4	1315008000	The I-Pod touch that I ordered my daughter got here in just a few days, so there was not much waiting time. Everything is just like they tell you and it works great. The only thing about it is the screen, I must tell you that this is not something for your chld! I wish that somebody would have told me that before I spent the money. My daughter(13yrs old) droped it in the first 3 days and the screen cracked, it still works but to get the screen fixed it cost just 40 dollars less, than it would to buy a new I-pod. Its a pour design and the screen will hit the floor every time you drop it or knock it off anything, and kids will be kids. The I-pod touch is great for a person who is out of high school, but I wouldnt get it for somebody that is less than 18 yrs old.Apple iPod touch 8 GB (4th Generation) NEWEST MODEL
5	1314921600	I love this iPod touch.  Very light, the screen is clear.  However, when Amazon recommends to buy the screen protector and the back cover, don't take this option.  Just buy the iPod touch, the covers can be bought at different places with better quality.
5	1314921600	This is the second ipod touch I bought. First one has been lost. I love it very much. Listen to the music, play games,send emails, surf the net.... Could not live without it! Shipping was fast.
5	1314921600	Daughter loves her ipod touch 4th generation. She listens to it all the time, has a student planner app, games, music, audiobooks and more. Love Apple.
5	1314921600	Bought this for my son for his birthday.  He does not leave home without it.  It truly is the best thing ever.  Entertains on long trips, cool features, can't say enough about it.
1	1314921600	as I do review a product not to Arrive? your company control this product the first of August and I do not answer my e-mail.I want to know what happened to my ipod.
5	1314835200	Great will recommend to friends. 100% satisfied. I will recommend saler to others.No problems with the I pod. Condition was perfect.Every one should use this saler, I recommend it to every one!
5	1314748800	No complaints!  Brand new in box. No problems! Product received as described and in the original box. Great buy, very happy with it!
5	1314748800	this product was perfect.never ordered before through amazon.com.this was my first purchase and i totally loved it.quality is great, item wasnt damaged during delivery and it was neatly packed.ive been ordering from amazon ever since.i just love this site!
1	1314748800	I bought this for my 8 year old son for his birthday to keep his growing music collection on it, some Bugs Bunny cartoons, his personal photo collection and some kids games. The size _just_ makes it for this use. I wish these were a bit cheaper though... a larger capacity would have been better, but not for the higher prices they charge.Ok... now to my gripe with Apple. I hate Apple and their supposed perfect operating systems. I'm a PC person, for sure. A power user, really. BUT I've owned higher end MACs for years. My MACs always crash... almost every session. (My PCs rarely crash... I have a ration of 6 PCs to 3 bad Apples). This Ipod Touch does the same thing... especially true of iTunes (Im on the latest version). Craps out... freezes... some functionality missing when you connect (like syncing). Searching on the iTunes store stinks. No compatibility with playlists already created on other music player software. (It's a royal pain to convert playlists one by one!)Anyway... My son loves his new tech gift, but since _I_ am the one who has to maintain it, I HATE the thing. I have yet to have a single session in iTunes where things run perfectly.Apple... ugh.
5	1314748800	I MUST BE VERY HONEST!!!!August 7, 2011 through August 17, 2011Amazon.com was selling this iPod Touch 8GB 4th Generationfor $199.99.YOU MUST REALLY WACTH FOR THE SALES AT AMAZON,I was doing my own "MARKET WATCH" at Amazon.com beginningAugust 5, 2011 and ending August 7, 2011.I've had this device for 22 days so far,its compact, discreet, and an excellent device.It works perfectly for myself.The down side of the iPod Touch 8GB 4th Generation is thatyou're NOT getting 8 GB, its ONLY RECEIVE 6.5GB and that's documentedin the iPod, straight out of the Amazon box and Apple packaging.If you select "GENERAL", then select "ABOUT" and this will give youall of your information for:SONGSVIDEOSPHOTOSAPPLICATIONSCAPACITYAVAILABLEVERSIONMODELSERIAL NUMBERWi-Fi ADDRESSBLUETOOTHIf Amazon.com wants to they check this iPod Touch.
2	1314748800	I have had this iPod Touch for several weeks, and have worked and worked to get email set up.  No luck.Got my music on easily but the quality of the music is much inferior to my previous iPod 6th gen Nano.Extremely difficult to type on.  Very touchy.  Not user friendly.  I am a 20 year Mac user, so am familiar with apple products.  This is waaaaay overpriced for the inconvenience.  Very sorry I bought it.  Think I'll send it back...if I can find the packaging!2/1/12  Still haven't figured out how to work this thing!  Such an expensive piece of crap.  Won't stay on the net, won't got to app store, won't do anything I want it to do.  Just a dead weight in my purse.  Did I mention that there is absolutely NO battery life!  Even when turned off.  Why do they make such a poor product!  Would love to play games but it will never go on a game site.11/4/12  Biggest complaint is that it will not hold a charge when not used.  Then when it discharges, EVERYTHING has to be set up from scratch!  Very annoying.  Am sorry I ever purchased it!  Never had any real fun with it!  Really expensive mistake!  I think it is probably defective.  No other apple products lose their charges this fast!
5	1314748800	This product was delivered as advertised.  Condition was good with no scatches on the screen and only small scratches on the back.  Had a small issue with it a week after it was received, but it was still under warranty, so a trip to the Apple Store was all that was required.  Shipping was very fast
5	1314662400	This was a bday gift for my 9 year old son.  He was so excited when he opened it and I was excited that it shipped and was here on time for his big day!  Thanks for quick delivery and for a product that was just as we expected.
5	1314576000	I received my ipod after one week, so shipping was very fast. Device in perfect condition, packaging about right. Quality of movies and pictures is brilliant. I recomend You this player, it's better to pay more and have good fun without any problems.
5	1314403200	Bought one of these back in May for my grandson's birthday.  Older brother wanted one too so I came back again.  Great service, great delivery time, great item!  What more could I ask for.Apple iPod touch 8 GB (4th Generation) NEWEST MODEL
3	1314403200	A great device with lots of uses - both for fun and for information. However, if you are a parent you should be aware that Apple does a very poor job of managing access to the internet through its third party Apps. Many of the Apps are merely a link or two away from full, unrestricted internet access, even those with age 4+ ratings. Parental Controls are ineffectual once such an App has been loaded onto the device. For more information there is a Facebook page that I just stumbled accross that has some good info on the subject: "Protect Kids From the App Store" ( [...] ).
5	1314316800	it came brand new in a ipod box just like if u go to the ipod storevery fast shippingvery easy to hook upi hope this helped u out
5	1314230400	I purchased this for my 8 year old so she would stay off my phone and my computer and itnot only worked like a charm it was an awesome piece of technology to boot.She has sooo much fun playing her games and taking pictures and there are so many free appsfor her to chose from. She loves it! Great buying experience from Amazon. It arrived in a couple of daysand was charged when we got it.
5	1314144000	The Ipod Touch is a great device. It has lots of features, and an endless app store filled with $.99 games. Of these games, these 15 are some of the best:15. Battleheart- a casual RPG with cartoon graphics.14. Tiny Tower- A fun game where you build your own tower.13. Burn the Rope- an action/puzzle game where you try to burn different ropes by tilting the device.12. Spongebob Marbles and Slides- a little bit expensive, but a great puzzle game.11. Cover Orange- A fun puzzle game that has over 100 levels.10. Star Wars: Battle For Hoth- an incredible tower defense game.9. Air Penguin- A fun jumping game, but you have to be sitting down to play it.8. Pocket God: Journey to Uranus- not as good as Pocket God, but it just started out, and it's probably going to get better.7. Doodle Jump- The best jumping game out there. It has lots of enemies, backgrounds, and power-ups to make the game even better.6. Fruit Ninja- A neat game where you slice fruit with your finger, trying to get combos.5. Trade Nations- Sort of like Age of Empires, but instead of killing enemies, you're focusing on making a bigger town.4. Tiny Wings- A fun game where you play as a bird, zooming up and down hills trying to fly.3. Cut The Rope- An incredible puzzle game where you slice ropes to get the candy to Om Nom.2. Angry Birds- Although I hate this game, most people love it. You'll probably enjoy flinging birds at pigs!1. Pocket God- The best Ipod game out there. You destroy Pygmies in many different ways, with minigames to make it better. Every update brings a new "challenge" for you to complete, and sometimes something new (such as a new island or minigame.) Even if you complete these, you can still get hi-scores on the minigames, find new secrets, or just destroy Pygmies for fun.
5	1314144000	I love my new ipod, it is easy to use, works perfectly until now, it arrived on time... It is very slim, nice and light to carry... The only advice that I can give is to buy a protection to carry it because it seems very fragile if you drop it... Also buy protection for the screen because you use it all the time and you dont want to scratch it... The only bad thing is that I can't registrate with mi country's zip code I don't know why, and that is the only bad thing to say about the ipod :)
5	1314057600	It's an Apple Ipod Touch so of course it works great.  This review is more a review of how Amazon has the best prices on the IPOD Touch 4G. Extremely fast shipping and better pricing than Wally World or Best Buy.  I bought 1 for each of my 3 daughters for Christmas and my girls are tough on these Ipods.  Its been 8 months now and these units have held up and worked extremely well. Would buy again.
5	1314057600	Being an MP3 Player, its ability to also play games, read books, and chat is impressive. Being slim and cool also has it's drawbacks: My friend had dropped it on the bathroom tile floor, cracking the glass screen. Also, sometimes using it for gaming encourages the top half of the iPod (the part with the camera if held vertically) to be a little warm. Of course, I'm just picky, so it isn't a great fault. Overall, and great tech gadget to play with. If only it had free 3G or 4G network! But of course, that'd be too good a product and would probably multiply it's price, so I guess I shouldn't hope for that much! :D
5	1313971200	This is really a great product. You get the exact same thing as you would get from another store for $20.00 cheaper, right to your doorstep!! LOVE IT!!
5	1313971200	I just love the Ipod Touch I received. It is amazingly fast and the sound quality is uncomparable. Definitely recommended. Thanks Amazon.
5	1313884800	i  wasnt sure if i would this ipod i never had one before but i got it on time it works great it was new n the box
5	1313884800	My daughter saved her money to buy this Ipod. She loves it! She had no problem setting it up herself.  What I liked is that I could also choose some of the settings with my own code so she can't change them.  I wish their were a few more parental controls though.
5	1313798400	The IPOD touch is wonderful. I have found so many aps for free and it is in use all day long. Great way to use an I POD wihtout the monthly fee of a phone.
5	1313625600	What can I say about this purchase? I use my iPod everyday, it still works very well, I was EXTREMELY happy with the price, and it looked very nice and well put together.This was my best purchase off of this site
5	1313625600	Purchased an IPOD Touch GB using the trade-in program.  Great way to save money. I am Very happy with the Amazon!
5	1313625600	I purchased this as a gift for my daughters birthday and have all her favorite songs downloaded to it. She will be so happy with this. It's a great investment for those who enjoy music and likes to have pictures and videos at their disposal.
4	1313452800	We purchased this iPod touch for our 6 year old daughter.  My wife and I have iPhones and an iPad and our older daughter (8) has the 32GB iPod touch.  With all the devices except for this one, I can set up one profile and have it sync all of the movies we have digital copies of, plus as many programs as we like and we still have some capacity left.  With the 8gb one, we have to rotate the movies and just put one or two on at a time (they take up about 1.5gb per movie).  The iPod touch is an amazing device.  Pretty much everything that is in an iPhone with the exception of no cellular (which for our girls is just fine).  I also went in and turned off a couple of programs that are connected via our wifi network (such as YouTube & Safari) to protect them--so having that option is a very good thing.  In the long run (and if they don't lose them or drop them in some water), this should be a cheaper option than their Leapsters which kept going out and required us to carry around a bag of cartridges.
5	1313452800	If you are like me - don't like mobiles - this is the best way to communicate with others and access internet social networks and chatting with others.
5	1313193600	This is my first Apple product and first smart handheld (been using cheap pay-as-you-go cellphones for years). I have been using PCs since the early 80's so I'm no stranger to electronics.If you are planning to buy this - keep in mind the iPod Touch FIVE (as well as iOS5) is due out in Sept. or Oct. of 2011, possibly w/ 3g for data plans and I'm sure other improvements. I don't want a data plan (see disclaimer) and it was my birthday so I bit now for $200. This model is supposed to work w/ the new iOS5, fingers crossed.Pros - I was happy to find the external speaker for games and sound effects, I thought I would always need headphones and I hate headphones. The battery life is really good, much better than my PSP 3000 or DSi or Netbook or Flip. In sleep mode app purchases from my PC Win7 iTunes will download and install automatically. The email program worked w/ my internet provider without having to type in web.mail.com or any of that other stuff. And it works better than reading online. It's not all intuitive, but when you learn it it's all easy.Cons - Why does Apple use that big propitiatory 30 pin connector when everybody else uses micro/mini USB? And related, why does Apple use so much space for their connector yet can't spare space for a microSD card? It makes no sense. My 8gig model has 6.5 gig free. I didn't realize iOS4 took up so much space. My 8gig Flip UltraHD has 8gig space. Yes it's only a camera, but I like the space. Maybe FIVE will start at 16gig, 14.5 gig free would be a better ratio. No instruction manual. I know they like their little box but instructions for turning it off (not sleep) would be helpful, and navigation, and other things. The on line manual is over 100 pages, there's a lot to learn, and teach. Non-user replaceable battery. How long before this dies completely and wides up in landfill, 2 years? Maybe a $15 battery add-on will keep it going after that (see Monoprice)?I bought this as a handheld computer, been using it for a week and still no mp3s or videos on it. I didn't want an Apple product but could find no real alternative. There are some cheaper products out there but nothing seems to compare to this, a $200 computer in the palm of my hand w/ no subscription that just works. If anybody knows of something better AT THIS SIZE please let me know.Big disclaimer - I live on Long Island and as a Cablevision customer I have plenty of WiFi access, especially at all my kids sporting events. The iPod Touch also works as a little wireless tv ($50 value) IN my house, even the Met game which I assumed would be blacked out. No Verizon FIOS for me.
5	1313020800	Can you go wrong with an Ipod? It's an Apple product. User friendly interface and effortless navigation  using touch screen.You cant write anything bad about this product. If you see any bad reviews, it must be because of some other issue with the customer. The quality of an Apple Ipod cannot be challenged.This is my 3rd Ipod Touch from Amazon.
5	1313020800	I had the device for 6months now an every month I'm finding new uses for it....works well as a remote for my mac mini controlled tv,an other apps are there that will make many uses out the thing besides playing music an video.....only wish i bought the 32g.......8g was max out like the first month i had it but i manage by deleting songs to make room for more apps
4	1312934400	My daughter loves her i-pod sooooo much and wow what a price to pay! I saved myself about $50, what a savings.
5	1312761600	It works just like I went and got it from walmart or some where...I was a little scared before it arrived cause it said like new but when I got it it looked new to me...100% happy.
5	1312675200	I love my IPod touch. I use it for the mp player at work but love the games and the aps.  I play Words with Friends every night.  My 4 year old granddaughter also loves it. I am getting her one for Christmas.  Can't live without it now!!
5	1312675200	Really a great ipod . I love the added features on the 4th generation . So much to do with not enough time in the day to do it lol . I would recommend this product to anyone
3	1312588800	The iPod Touch 4th Generation is by far the most advanced iPod yet, sporting new-and-improved features like dual cameras and an amazing retina display. It offers amazing connectivity, sound quality, WIFI reception, screen use, and dozens of other useful features that will help you from day to day.However, its the "little things" which render the iPod Touch possibly the worst iPod Apple has ever released. Its battery life is absolutely terrible...I have owned 2, and both would not get anymore then 4 hours of life per charge from day 1. Even with the screen brightness turned down to the minimum, I could not strain more then 6 hours of battery life on a single charge. I find this disappointing, as the previous 3rd generation iTouch could get at least 12 hours per charge.While the 4th Generations "Retina" display is absolutely stunning, it does have its setbacks. The screen's surface is far more vulnerable then any of the previous models, as it can be easily scratched by a fingernail or even a small piece of dirt on your finger. This setback can be solved via the installation of a screen protector (I recommended the SGP Steiheil...Zagg Invisible Shield's are crap), I am still disappointed that use of the iTouch requires you to purchase a protector, seeing as previous iTouch models could be used safely without one.The back of the iTouch is also more vulnerable then the earlier iTouchs. Both of my iPods have been kept in Incipio-brand Hive cases since I purchased them, and yet they still have had the life scratched out of them. This is annoying, although in the long run it does not affect iPod functionality.As for the "new" A4 Processor which is installed in the iTouch 4...I have seen no visible improvement in iTouch speed over the iTouch 3. If anything, my iTouch 4 is SLOWER then the older iTouch 3, as it lags when I am multitasking (ERG, playing music and writing a note at the same time), whereas the iTouch 3 does not lag at all.And finally, the buttons. The buttons on the iTouch 4 (the volume and lock buttons, not the home button) are an absolute tragedy. They are cheaply and poorly designed...they are difficult to press (even more so when your iTouch 4 is in a case), and they break easily. I had my lock button die in only 2 months of VERY LIGHT use, rendering the iPod useless as I could not turn it on or off. The buttons alone make the iTouch 4 a waste of money in many ways.On the postitive side, the iTouch 4 possess a better internal speaker then the Itouch 3, and it also sports a pair of impressive cameras (which are capable of taking pictures, videos, and webcamming) and a stunning Retina display. WIFI speed and range also seem to be somewhat improved over the earlier models.Overall, I am extreamly dissapointed in Apples latest rendition of the Ipod Touch, and I am hoping they will improve the quality of the device in the 5th generation.PROS -Dual CamerasRetina DisplayEnhanced WIFIImproved SpeakerCONS -Frail ScreenFragile Back CasingLaggy ProcessorEXTREMELY Low Battery LifeCheap, Poorly Designed "Lock" and "Volume" Buttons
5	1312588800	This was a wonderful deal.  The ad said it had a few scratches on the back, which it did.  The ipod runs like a charm.  It was for my 8 year old daughter.  She could care less about the scratches and I got it for less than the store.  It only took about 5 days to arrive at my house.  I have recommended to others to check amazon for iPods.
5	1312416000	Bought this unit to go in our art store for using with Square to take credit cards. This is a perfect solution to paying monthly fees to have a CC service. Square charges %3 per transaction and it can sit there and not cost us a thing monthly. We are "borrowing" WIFI from the neighbor for the internet connection. We downloaded the app on to the Ipod and created an account on Square.com. It saves us $35 a month over having a CC service - too cool! dawjr
5	1312416000	I got the iTouch but then 2 weeks later it broke, but AMAZON WAS AWESOME THEY GAVE ME A NEW ONE FREE it is awesome everything is great. To start out the quality is great there is nothing wrong with it. 2nd battery life, alot of others say its bad but its great, a great investment would be an adapter (USB to Power outlet) then you can charge wherever theres an outlet. 3rd Its a lot of fun my friends love playing on it just like me. 4th the sound is great even out of the speaker. 5th I have the 8gb and it is perfect for me i have over 1000 songs and its great and still working. 6th this device is great for everyone even for babies, just don't have babies drool on it. 7th the speed is great nothing can slow it down, just every so often close apps in your multitasking bar, by touch and hold an app in the multitask bar and press the subtraction sign. 8th the Appearance is great its really thin and nice metallic finish. 9th The brightness is strong but you can lower it in your settings make sure you have the ipod on energy saver it helps. 10th the touch screen is great its a lot better then some other touch screen devices. 11th the camera quality could be better but its great for picture taking and video filming. 12th it is 229$ a little pricy but it has a camera and a lot of great featurs but apple should of kept it at 199$ but on Amazon its only 209$. 13th it is well built and perfect. 14th as said before its really thin so it is very portable and its great for an on the go pocket computer. 15th the apps are great, the run great and they are really fun. 16th the features are great it has multitasking, camera, music, great, apps, wallpapers, languages, an a lot great other ones. 17th the wifi conectivity is great i never had any problems with it just make sure that you have a wireless router and that the speed is good Verizon Fios is great internet service. 18th the conectivity is great nothing wrong with it never had it crash or go down. 19th The only buttons are the sleep and wake button, home button, volume up and down, they all work great nothing breaks apple does a great job. 20th The games work great there are only a couple that dont work as fast as they should but besides those the gameing is great the gyro and accelerometer is very good it works great and does any movement you do depending on the game. 21st the durability isnt that great the back holds up find but dont drop the ipod on a hard ground the screen could crack, invest in a screen protector and/or a case that goes over part of the screen like[[ASIN:B0043L4GBQ splash RaveSkin Rubberized Case for iPod Touch 4G (BLUE)]. 22nd The movie quality is great the screen is great quality too. 23rd the size is great it is very nice and portable the weight is great to not to heavy that it will pull your pants down and not to light that you dont even know its in your pocket. 24th the screen clarity is great never fuzzy its always clear and awesome i can see every little detail. 25th IT IS VERY COOL I COULD NEVER CHOOSE A DIFFERENT IPOD. 26th the screen resolution is great to, better than a lot of other brands touch screen mp3's. 26th the bluetooth is great i uploaded all my contacts to it from my phone. 27th the bluetooth reception is great unless you are near power transformers. 28th it is very user friendly you can change the setting depending on how you like it. 29th the setup is easy. I had an old nano, with songs on it so it took 15 minutes at most to set it up and upload my songs it was easy. and number 30 ITS AWESOME
5	1312329600	I LOVE this product. It is so cool. I have a host of games, music, and pictures on mine. It can do so many things. I feel fortunate to have mine and I highly recommend it!
4	1312329600	I love my Ipod. I'm on it 24/7. The only downsides are the battery life and the capacity. After you have used it for a long time it stays on less ans less. Also, it can only hold so much. Other than that I really love my Ipod.
5	1312243200	My friend recently ordered this for me, and it is my first Apple product. I always loved ipods but never could afford them. And dont be fooled, it says 8gb but its really 6.5. But I meade it work and I love it(= perfect companion to my HTC phone when I'm on the go(= geat condition and fast shipping to(= thanks a bunch!
5	1312243200	Bought this last year for my 8 yr old daughter.  She uses it for just about everything.  Extremely similar to the iphone 3gs and it has all sorts of apps you can buy or get for free if you have an itunes account.  I would tell anyone looking at one of these to get one, my family has 4 total and haven't had any issues with any of them.
5	1312156800	I've never had an I-pod before this one and was wary of the touch screen.  Other touch screens I have used before just didn't work well.  But the touch screen is great!  The I-pod holds lots of music, is great for games, and other apps.  Overall very pleased with this product.
5	1312070400	Love my ipod touch! Got the 8 GB one to use just for productivity and it has very effectively and efficiently replaced all my numerous paper notes, calendars, schedules, to do lists, idea lists, etc. Love that I have a camera at any time when shopping, so if I need to ask my husband what he thinks of a purchase, can just snap a photo. Esp. love the apps that allow me to sync to my google calendar, keep track of my many various to do lists, quickly see currency conversions (xe.com app is great) and a dictionary app.
4	1311897600	I bought this iPod figuring there may be something wrong overall it is refurbished. That one problem is that when you want to charge it says it's not compatible and says it can't charge, but it does anyway. Other than that it's a perfectly working iPod no scratchs at all
5	1311897600	I Love This Ipod!! The Only bad part , when you try to touch things on the sides and corners of the screen, sometimes it doesnt go through , maybe you could recalibrate ,but i didnt learn how to yet. (maybe Its because of my fairly big fingers )(:
5	1311724800	Thank you Amazon!  Outstanding purchase process, excellent results with no headaches, surprises or complaints!  This is truly the shopping method for the future.  I especially appreciate the ability to fully educate myself on the details of the item I am researching and also being able to view pros and cons expressed by other reviewers, on line.  This type of unbiased critique process typically makes or breaks the deal for me, and helps make me a more informed buyer and owner.  Thanks Again!!
5	1311638400	My son blew out my last I touch from sucking on the power supply line. I was ready for an upgrade and I love my new I touch!!
5	1311465600	I bought it for my daughter and she couldn't be any more happy with it...She just love it..and now she can keep up with her friends..It is very easy for her to use and she's 12..I would by for myself if i had a little extra cash...lol But i will be buying one for my other daughter soon and she is 10...love it,love it!!!
1	1311465600	I bought this off Amazon and it said it would take 5 days... It took 10... I love the apps but after the first 3 days the screen broke... Very badly... I would and wouldn't tell you to buy it... If you want fun buy it... If you want something to last... DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It cost $100 to fix and i'm not sure if i'm willing to spend that much to fix it... Oh and don't get the 8 gb... You lose like a gig for just new software...
5	1311465600	Love the new camera on this iPod Touch 4th! Pretty much an iPhone when you download TextFree, because it is free texting, and when you have the 4th gen, calling too!
4	1311292800	The IPOD touch is a great device.  It does exactly what it is designed for and does it well.  My only complaint is that it does not support flashplayer if it did it would be nearly perfect.
3	1311292800	So the ipod arrived with a charger and a pair  of headphones. It looked brand new out of the box until i tried to prwess the home button which doesnt work. So everytime I want to go home I will have to restart the ipod ! -___- not good.
4	1311292800	Overall: If you aren't going to use apps or watch videos, it would be better to have a smaller, cheaper, and less fragile Nano or Shuffle. But I love having a bunch of apps and videos at my disposal, and in a relatively small package. The camera is not impressive at all, but its better than nothing, and is best used to take quick pictures for social networking.Pros: Great display, easy to use and set up with iTunes, has two cameras and microphone, plus all of the cool features that are inherited from other ipod touchesCons: Cameras are more gimmicky, and are not very good, ipod is slower compaired to higher capacity ipods, and probably just my ipod touch, but the home button doesnt work sometimes.
5	1311206400	I really like my new I pod it is exactly what i paid for and it came very quickly and everything was with it. For $209 you can't find a better deal on a brand new I pod. but just as an aside it was a little hard to set up but that doesn't effect the quality or the performance just if you are not really technology savvy you may want to have someone help you.
5	1311206400	This is by far the best ipod touch ever made, I bought the 8gb one which doesn't have much capacity tough. It has the tipical IOS problems everyone is used to (bluetooth compatibility, itunes, etc)
5	1311120000	I ordered this product for a birthday present.it came days beforeit was expected...about three days to get it. Also was in great shape not one prob. Amazon always does a great job.
5	1311120000	LOVE THIS GADGET, BOUGHT IT AS GIFT FOR 6 YR OLD TO KEEP HER BUSY ON SUMMER BREAK AND SHE IS LOVIING IT!
5	1311033600	I love my ipod.  I use it as a phone in wifi spots, minus the contract!  I only wish I had gotten the next size up because I like to take pictures and videos.  Oh well.
5	1310947200	I think no further comments are necssary, this IPod touch is simply great and suprises with the great number of features.
5	1310947200	i just got my itouch in the mail today, it has no scratches or anything on it (i got it refurbished) it runs great, nothing is wrong with it. when i got it someone elses email was registered to it but that was easily fixable. it's way better than i expected it to be, i am extremely happy with my purchase!
5	1310947200	Excellent portable storage! I got a Bose portable sound dock to go with it, and I'm the hit of the summer beach party season!
5	1310947200	I bought the Ipod Touch G4 with 8Gig of memory for my husband for Father's Day and he loves it. I own the 3G myself and my biggest complaint was that it didn't have a camera. Now they've added the front and back camera and it's perfect for my husband. He loves to take pictures and post them on FB. The Ipod is a bit pricey and you can get better deals on similar products, but you can't beat Apple for functionality, user interface and quality. It's a bit bulkey if you're looking for a music player that is more on the small side. I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants a top quality music player with nearly unlimited functionality.
5	1310860800	This is one of the best ipods ever i want it so bad. Everything is good about it. I recomend it to anyone
1	1310860800	This ipod was made in Japan, but nowhere on the advertisement did it indicate this.  Apple will not service this model.  I called Apple after the ipod crashed, only 7 months after purchasing the item.This is false advertising as far as I am concerned
5	1310860800	Best purchase I've made in along time. It's great I use it everyday. It also shipped so fast I didn't expect it to be here the day I received it in the mail.
4	1310774400	We bought this Ipod for my 11 year old daughter and she is sooo happy. It came on time for her birthday. Recommend it, but 8 gb is not enough.
5	1310688000	I ordered this product it came in in just 3 days and it was perfect. I gave it has a gift and they never new it was used.
3	1310688000	I boutght the iPod touch on a whim and because I had heard good things about iPod.  I think that if you have never been a customer of apple before that you should probably not splurge on the iPod, because pretty much all they care about is money.  If you want to get music from another computer other than your main one, it's almost impossible to transfer the music onto your iPod unless you want to delete all of the music you already have on it, unless you specifically purchased the music through apple.At my house I have three computers, and all I wanted to do was to get some of my mom's music off of her computer onto my iPod, but it told me that the iPod could only be connected to one itunes library at a time, and in order to get any of the music I wanted from my mom's computer I would have to delete all of the music on my iPod before i could get any of it.  And it's not like I'm trying to steal music, my family paid for every CD that we have on our computers, but my laptop does not have a CD drive attatched so it's not like I have a way to just move the music onto my itunes unless i go through several hours of work to transfer the music onto a flash drive and then copy it onto my computer (NOT TO ITUNES, BECAUSE THEY DON'T "RECOGNIZE" ANYTHING OTHER THAN AN IPOD) and then I would have to move the music onto my iTunes library and let it load for about another hour.Yeah, the camera was good and it was fun to be able to go onto the internet, but I wanted a music player that was easy to use, not a game system (and every app you get is crap unless you pay MORE money for it.), and not a camera.  I wanted a music player, but I was thoroughly disappointed with the crappy, money-grubbing people at apple.
3	1310688000	I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT WAS LOOKING TOO GOOD WITH ENOUGH CAPACITY 8GB? WAS PERFECT ON LINE BUT WHEN IT CAME THE REALITY WAS IT IS JUST 6GB WHICH A SHAME TO SEE AMAZON TELL  LIES TO IT'S CUSTOMERS.FOLLOWING THIS EXPERIENCE,-I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO TRUST AMAZON AGAIN.WHOWEVER WANT TO BUY IT BE AWARE IT IS NOT 8GB BUT 6GB YOU ARE BUYING . HUHUHHH !!!! 8GB! MONEY IS SWEET BUT EAT IT WITH HONEST WE ALASO SUFFER AND SWEAT TO GET IT.
2	1310601600	Apple will need to stop adding these small features that you'll never use on there products and fix the major problems, like Camera Quality, WiFi, and Durability. First, let's start with the WiFi. PUT WIRELESS INTERNET ON THE IPHONES AND IPODS! My Phone has portable WiFi, and it isen't as highly rated as the iPod. Just pay T-Mobile $10?Month for free WiFi, but the quality does not look the best. If you want a iPod, get something else if you just want to use the iPod for Internet Access, which my friend Austin does all the time.Durability, now if this fell on a wooden floor, it would break the screen in a 1-foot drop. My phone is extremly durable. I threw it across a BaseBall-Diamond and I go grab it, look, it works fine. I dropped it in water too, but that messed it up a little, I let it sit for 24 hours and then it worked fine again. If you dropped the iPod at all, it would most likley break easily. The screen cracks and you to pay $100 to fix it. So glue your hands if you want to not drop it.Design, it's pretty good for a size. But for not breaking it by dropping it, they shouldn't build it that way. The design is built in a bad way to hold it by. Easily can slip out of your hands. If you treat this thing like a toy, I'll break in less than a day.Camera, now I am highly knowledged about Cameras, and I am right when I say, the Quality is NOT GOOD! Less than a Pixel for Photo Quality, and Video is 360-480 I think. So only about 360p, which is good for a actual camera.I am done. You make your own review. Tell me what you think.
4	1310515200	prior to this itouch i had a first gen which had no camera nor great image quality, but this itouch looks really good. I've been messing with the camera feature a lot. if you don't want to get a iphone or you just want a good mp3 player etc.. get this.by the way.. i reduced a star because finding a good case for this itouch in particular was a bit of a hassle.
4	1310515200	I bought this mainly for music at the gym.  It is easy to change tunes, especially with Genius.  I am still low on the learning curve with the camera.
5	1310428800	I bought it as a replacement for my grandson. At least the price was cheaper from the first time.  Reinstalled all the previous apps and games and it is working fine. No problems.
5	1310342400	My son was so excited when he got it in. Great Birthday gift. easy to use and great graphics. Love it.
5	1310342400	I bought the Apple IPOD Touch for my grand-daughter after she had major surgery. She was absolutely thrilled to receive it and hasn't stopped using yet. The IPOD arrived promptly and only had barely visable scratches on the back otherwise it was brand spanking new. She loves it and thanks me all the time for her IPOD.I could not have afforded this IPOD at it's usual price so this lower price was just what I needed.
5	1310342400	I got this for my husband for father's day, and he is having the time of his life with it.  He plays games all the time.  He really enjoys it.  I am glad I made the purchase.
2	1310256000	I ordered this ipod for my daughter for xmas last year and she had a very hard time getting any assistance from Apple trying to set it up.  She continously had problems with it but was too scared to come to her father or I to let us know that since she received it, she has nothing but problems with it.  Her pictures would load to FB, the APPS disappeared and any songs she had on it would skip or not play at all.  She thought we would be mad or think she did something to it.  It wasnt until I just recently bought a 2nd IPOD from Amazon that didnt work that she came to us to tell us what was going on.  By this time it was past warranty and Apple wants us to pay for any help even though you know that the problems are the ipod, nothing she did.  I have spent thousands of dollars on amazon and have referred many peoepl to buy from here, but I am starting to get skeptical if I should continue to buy.  Now she wants a Ipod Nano Shuffle 8gb & I am not sure if I want to try to buy from amazon or not since I already have 2 broken ones in less then a year.
5	1310083200	The iPod Touch has plenty of useful apps and is fun to use. The display is sharp and clear. I considered getting a 32 GB model but the price was right on the 8 GB one.It sure beats hauling around a netbook or laptop. I can connect wirelessly at most of the places I frequent to check email, twitter, Facebook, get news, GPS information, etc.Sound quality is great when using headphones or an external speaker, but poor with the built in speakers.I have a all of my favorite songs, a few pictures and lots of apps on it. I still have 5 GB free.I have watched Netflix but the screen is a little too small for my taste.I am awaiting iOS5, which is scheduled for release in Fall of 2011. It will rectify a lot of shortcomings.My biggest complaint is the batteries drain very quickly, even when in standby.
5	1309996800	I'm in awe of this device. I'm old, but tech-experienced. I'm completely stupid for this instrument. It just wows me. There's no need for a comprehensive review (although, I appreciate those people who do provide us that information). And the apps. Amazing number of free programs. The only one I've paid for was a wireless printer app. Bought an 8gb because I'm not a collector. I could go on and on. But, I won't. Buy one. You'll be delighted. Oh, I bought a nice case for it at Overstock.com (Sorry, Amazon, I tried).  Item#: 13606922. $7.00.07.21.11 Review update - OMG! This thing is amazing!
4	1309996800	This was exactly what I thought it would be. It is in good condition and arrived promptly. It was purchased by my 12y/o daughter and she is very pleased with it. It's easy to work and right now she is reading a downloaded book on it. A good buy for the money.
5	1309824000	The iPod Touch is probably the best gaming device on the market today.  Before the iPod Touch my kids had PSPs and Ninetindo DSs.  It use to cost us anywhere from $10 - $30 and sometimes more for one game.  Now my kids have access to thousands of applications including games, educational apps, and utilities all for FREE!  And if they want a great game it can usually be bought for less than $2, and at most $7.  I basically banned all other portable game systems from the house because economically the iPod Touch just makes sense.  The kids also make movies and can do FaceTime video chat with each other and with me on my iPhone.
4	1309824000	The iPod Touch 4th Generation is a great little device, there's no doubt about that as I'm sure you know by their popularity.The price is a drawback though, personally I think it's a bit overpriced, especially since it's only 8gig and not expandable.One of the great attributes of the iPod Touch is the volume, it gets nice and loud while staying very clear.Aesthetically the iPod Touch is a nice looking device, that is until you actually handle it then it becomes covered with your fingerprints. I let my kids use it for an hour or so and it came back covered with so many fingerprints that the screen was actually blurry.iTunes is just horrible, too bad you're pretty much stuck with it though.Pros:+Lots of apps in iTunes to choose from+Great portable gaming system+Excellent graphics+Volume is loud+Thin and lightweightCons:-iTunes is horrible software-Camera not the greatest-Can't uninstall apps from Apple-Fingerprint magnet
5	1309824000	I purchased this for X-mas 2011, for my husband and he uses it ,daily! I only wish I'd gotten him the 16g, or 32g. He's already run out of space as a musician and avid reader.
1	1309737600	You can buy the iPod touch in a store and pay cash but you can NOT set it up in iTunes without a credit card.  Even the PayPal option requires a credit card.You cannot just connect to your computer then drag 'N drop files into the iPod.  You MUST install iTunes software and upgrade all your software prior to setting up the iPod.  You must use iTunes ANYTIME you connect to your computer and you cannot access files on another computer without iTunes.  I uninstalled iTunes but many files were left behind and my computers performance did NOT return to normal.  I am going to have to format my hard drive and reinstall Windows and and all my software.iTunes software is huge in size, not intuitive and most definitely SPYWARE.  My computer speed was reduced by least 50%.  Four games stopped working and two programs DISAPPEARED.  One of the missing programs monitored what was being sent out over the internet.Total setup required about SIX (6) hours!WiFi was intermittent.  My WiFi provider would not accept my password.  Forced to use iMobile.I am returning this and asking for my money back tomorrow.  If it was not for iTunes, I would like this product and would write a very positive review.Addendum:  I was advised that Apple support could resolve most of my issues.  An additional problem arose;  I bought my iPod on June 30th and now on July 10th, my telephone support has expired.  But I can PURCHASE support.  That is absolutely UNREASONABLE.
5	1309651200	When you purchase something that you can't see or handle there is always great risk involved. Well I would like to report that this purchase of the iPod touch 4G 8th was a great one at best. The condition was better than I expected and the quality was the same. In came with everything! Now my wife can enjoy record her favorite(well that really means I can record for her...lol) and play them at work while she working in the OR. Thanks greatly!
5	1309651200	I have spent way too much time on my iPod. Great product.The only regret is Apple's insistence on forcing users through iTunes to access simple files. I am sure competition from Android will change that soon.
5	1309564800	This was a gift for my 16 yr old son. Just what he hoped it would be...so if he is happy, then we are happy to have spent the money to get it for him.
5	1309478400	We use this to keep the kids occupied when traveling or on special occasions. You can fit lots of games on it and it works great. Note that you can't play all the features on some of the games that require a microphone, but otherwise it behaves just like an iPhone.
4	1309478400	I bought this for my daughter for her 7th birthday. She loves it. I am pleased with it's ease of use for both me and her. My daughter has been using it to make videos of herself talking about the house and her toys. Definitely worth the money payed and there was no cosmetic damage or scratched despite being listed as refurbished.
5	1309478400	The ipod was something my daughter wanted.  She saved her money, and bought it.  I wish I was more up to date on the product, because she immediately dropped it, cracked it, and then got it replaced.  Also, there is an entire world out there that looms a credit card in the  picture, and if the child doesn't really understand all the money issues, it can be very daunting, with purchases vs free stuff.  Be very careful!  The customer service center at apple gave us some tips on putting restrictions on the purchases and content of the ipod.  Good luck!  My daughter is enthralled!
5	1309478400	This is an amazing device and works beautifully.  Only issue was that it required an operating system update, which took an hour to download! Since that, however, no problems.
5	1309392000	I ordered this on the 21 of june and it came to my house on the 29 as an empty package.we called amazon and with no problem they sent us a new one with 2 day shipping at no extra charge
5	1309392000	Received it today.  I bought for my son for earning all "A's" on his report card.  He loves and is sharing with his siblings.  It was worth the price to give them another opportunity to bond!
4	1309305600	For my son's birthday this year, I bought him one of these new iPod's and he has been glued to it ever since. He absolutely loves it and uses it for almost everything. Whenever I am on a trip I can talk to him on Skype with it, he can update all of his music on his own, and he can even keep in touch with his friends! It's like having a phone without having one!
4	1309219200	I wasnt excited about paying extra for apps but at least they are available.  The phone itself is very high quality, graphics, speed, etc.. It is a fun  little toy  and works well. This phone was not a disapointment and was what I wanted and more. It was for my 16 year old daughter for his birthday and she can play games, video , check email , etc.  it is like a little mini computer,--she loves it and the battery lasts a decent amount of time.
5	1309219200	This was a gift for my 13yr old son, from his grandmother. He couldn't wait to get it and was not disappointed when it came. I did a little comparison shopping first and purchasing it from Amazon saved money and, needless to say, time. My son loves his Ipod, he loves listening to his music, accessing internet, playing games etc. This Ipod really is versatile. My favorite feature- " find me" feature. Love that if my son looses his Ipod, Apple can find it. Have to mention, I had to call Apple Support, probabably the best customer service experience I've ever had. I'm very low tech, the rep. was patient and informative. Impressive!
5	1309219200	Got this for my 81 year old husband who really only wanted a substitute for his PalmPilot, just a calender. He is having a great time with it. Is using it daily and is discovering new things to do with it each day. He did have to buy a Stylus because he has bad problems with his hands and could not finger the screen very well. Even though we will never use all of the avalible programs it is more than worth the price.
5	1309132800	This is the second iPod I've owned. It was definitely worth upgrading to the 4th generation. This device can do some amazing things and the sound quality with a good headset is remarkable! The $204.00 I paid for it was a bargain!
5	1309132800	I bought this item used and it is great!! The battery life is good and I would recommend this to a friend. If you want good quality at a cheaper price, GET ONE USED!!! The used ones are the best! They have small scratches on the back,  but remember to read the review of the specific ipod before buying it. If you are worried about the scratches, and don't want to have them, the price will go up, but I have to tell you, they are minor and almost always on the back plate.
5	1309132800	The 4G is the best iPod yet.  Does everything an iPhone does except make calls and all you need to make calls wifi and an voip app like google voice or skype.  The biggest drawback is the lack of flash memory capability.  Not particularly an apple fan but I do like the iPhone and iPods.
5	1309132800	Got this as a surprise for my birthday, and we haven't stopped using it yet!  Since we're not i-phone users, this is the perfect alternative.  Great buy and well worth it!
4	1309046400	All in all quite satisfied with the touch 4 i pod.My reservations are;I don't think that the manual explains things clearly to a new user of Apple products and takes for granted too much.For a person a "certain Age' it can be complicated, causing me to have to call Apple for help.E.g. For a person who is used to using Internet Explorer for many years, Safari was a complete mystery to me; I didn't even realise it was my path to the internet. I was repeatedly informed that I had to enable Cookies to access certain web sites, but not told whether to enable cookies on the i pod or computer?I also didn't realise that if I deleted music from i tunes I lost them on the i pod, something else not explained clearly. There a few instances of that.Am gradually getting used a different way of thinking, but it will take time.Ken Roland
5	1308960000	My son got one of these and I was amazed at all the things he could do with it:camera, check emails, internet search, maps, weather, stock quotes....all you need is a Wi-Fi connection to access about everything.  Obviously the camera works all the time.  And, oh yes, you can load it with your music and carry that with you, too.I thought my netbook computer was the answer to streamlining travel, but this has it beat.  OK, if you need to send an email, the "keyboard" is awfully small, but it works.Highly recommended!October 2011 Update:Continue to be extremely pleased with this purchase.  Now using the iPod for Skype video conferencing and making Skype telephone calls.  Fantastic!!!
2	1308873600	I received this iPod and was extremely excited. I attempted to put apps on it and that took me about 45 minutes just to figure it out. As i had it for a few days i noticed the speakers weren't working at all. There was absolutely no sound. Then i discovered that there is only internet in wifi areas. P.S. many of the apps dont work without internet. So it was practically USELESS anywhere outside of my house. The next morning after i noticed that issue, i was sitting in front of my computer and i tried to go on facebook on my ipod. It said i had no internet connection though. I checked my wifi (it was on) and i checked the computers internet (fine too) so my ipod just decided to be mean to me. After all the saving (2 years worth) it was the biggest waste of time and money i have ever spent. However, i think i just received a deffective one. But this was my expirience. Please learn from it.
5	1308873600	this ipod is absolutely awesome! I love the camera feature on the iPod Touch now, and the resolution is really good. It is very portable, slips in and out of my pocket easily, such a neat little device for my music. it can definitely make a great gift as well.
2	1308873600	Based on my wife and I both having iPhones, we wanted to get our 10 year old daughter an iPod Touch for her birthday.  After 2 weeks it is still functional but it fell from the table onto carpet and the screen cracked.  Very cheap, I don't recommend purchasing unless you are either satisfied with being disappointed or want to continually spend $100 to replace the cracked screen.  Overall I am just disappointed they don't use similar quality screen as the iPhone.  Note that my wife and I have had our iPhone's for 2 years and we have both accidently dropped on carpet, hardwoods, and cement without damage.  Extremely disappointed in Apple for cutting this corner.
4	1308787200	I really loved my 3G iPod touch but unfortunately one night I drop it on our hardwood floors and the screen cracked a bit. It was still usable but I wanted to upgrade to the 4g anyway. I have to say of all the electronic devises I've ever owned this is one I NEVER put down. The battery life isn't quite as good as the 3G but that may be because I never put the thing down! You will be really happy with this purchase!
5	1308787200	I bought this iPod for my 11 year old daughter who is very tech-savvy.  It has met both of our expectations.  Apple lives up to it's reputation for quality and innovation once again.  Be careful when you buy a case that it does not interfer with the touch screen.
2	1308614400	I bought this from warehouse, "like new". Well, it doesn't look like a new one, there were scratches all over the back, though all the scratches were small. The battery seems to be a big issue for me on this one, it probably lasts 3 hours top. Even I don't do anything, I have to recharge it in about 4-5 days.
5	1308441600	I love my apple iPod Touch 8G; reasonably priced; very light weight and fully loaded.  Good investment, Amazon.com had the best price.
5	1308355200	I really love my ipod, does everything I need for portable entertainment. Wish I would have gotten the ones with higher gigs though.Colorado Springs Photographer - Charles Gilbert[...]
5	1308268800	Main reason I bought this is because its portable, you can carry it around in you  pocket. I dont have to carry around the laptop just to check emails and facebook. I also like watching netflix in bed, and listening to Pandora in bed or around the house with earphones. The apps and games are great. The apps are cheap, some goes on sale and some are free. This thing keeps my kids occupied while on the road and designated Wifi hotspots with media suited for children. The Retina screen is amazing, I can see the whole web page in this little screen. Im still exploring the many usages of this product and I am learning something new all the time. This is the first apple product I bought in my life and now I understand why apple products are expensive; Their quality is superb. I chose this product over a Kyros Android tablet because they didnt have netflix available for androids and I hear reviews that the Kyros crashes a lot. I am glad I did buy the ipod touch over the kyros. The only thing I dont like about it is the battery life, it eats a lot of power when playing games and video. Luckily there are many ways to charge it. You can charge it on you computer. You can buy a cheap usb wall plug. Or you can also use your tv's usb slot to charge it. Over all I am totally satisfied with the product for what I use it for.
1	1308268800	The item arrived pretty quickly, earlier than I expected actually. The item itself is pretty awesome thats why I purchased one as a gift for someone else. Anyways, I ordered this item as a gift and on my check out I had the option of getting it with a little note saying Happy Birthday I love you. And so when I get home I find the package outside of my door with the box ripped half way open with all of this dust INSIDE. NO note to be found. and a broken air bag and a broken freaking ipod case. So honestly, I dont know what deal amazon has with their shipping carrier but something has to change. I was completely UNSATISFIED! How am I going to give a gift in a broken box with all of the box practically denting the item. THANKS AMAZON! FOR NOTHING!
4	1308268800	I never owned an ipod touch before.  I just want to say if you know how to work a phone, you can work an ipod.Just two things I notice that I wasn't fully satisfied with:1. You can not edit or delete songs via your music list on your ipod, it appears you have to hook it up to a computer first.2. I don't like the camera quality, I know some reviewers say it doesn't matter much for quick shots, but I think its worst than a phone camera's resolution at times.And one last thing, it's only cool if you have wi-fi otherwise, you can do many of the same things on a phone.  Wish they come up with 3G or 4G networks for all devices, so we don't have to rely on free wi-fi to use these devices anywhere.
3	1308268800	One of the worst sounding music players available on the market.If you dont care for sound quality and only want it for the apps be my guest and buy it, the apps are great.If you care about the sound quality alot and dont care too much for the apps then I highly recommend a player from the company Cowon.They are very well known for theyre high quality products.
4	1308182400	in the description of the ipod it said that it was in good quality. when the ipod arrived it had a crack across the top of the screen.
5	1308009600	This is my first ever Ipod touch and i have to say its freakin awesome...The retina display looks amazing, The device has so many fun apps and games to keep me occupied when im on the go, and it's a great music player...The only down side it that the camera quality is not what i expected but its not horrible like some of the reviews say...Overall the best portable music player on the market ! LOVE IT
5	1308009600	A great product. Stable OS, as it is mature product. Better to buy online on Amazon.com etc so that you don't have to pay taxes
5	1307836800	I love my iPod. To see my whole review, check out my blog[...]You may also be thinking about buying a case for it so check out the review about a good case on my blog also. Hope ive been helpful!
5	1307836800	Apple's fourth-generation iPod touch finally gets a camera for HD video recording, and still-photo capture. Plus a second, front-facing camera brings FaceTime video chat to the touch. On the new high-res Retina display, everything looks crisp and colorful, and the screen remains highly responsive to touch. Apple eliminated video playback from its sixth-generation iPod nano ($149, ), making the touch the least-expensive video-playing iPod. Starting at $229 (direct, 8GB), however, it's not cheap, and that isn't much storage for an HD video device. The $299 32GB player seems like the best deal, while the 64GB model offers twice the storage, but remains exorbitantly priced at $399. Despite the cost, the iPod touch remains, by far, the best portable media player you can buy--and it retains our Editors' Choice crown.DesignApple put the iPod touch on a diet, yet again--at 3.6 ounces, it weighs a half-ounce less, and is slightly less wide at 4.4 by 2.3 by 0.3 inches (HWD). Apple's custom A4 chip powers the touch, and the multi-touch screen gets an upgrade to the iPhone 4's ($199, ) super-sharp Retina display. It remains at 3.5 diagonal inches, but with a resolution of 960 by 640 pixels (at 326 pixels per inch) it's easily the crispest, brightest, of any PMP on the market. The touch's left-hand panel houses two Volume buttons, and a headphone jack, a speaker, and a 30-pin connector for USB computer syncing are on the bottom of the player. The Power button sits up top, and the Home button remains below the display on the front panel. There are two camera lenses--one toward the top of the display, and one on the back, in the top left corner, which is accompanied by a mic. The back panel remains mirrored, so it's excellent for checking your teeth on the sly, but it picks up fingerprints very easily.In the box, you'll find a Quick Start Guide, a proprietary USB cable for connecting the touch to your computer, and a pair of Apple signature earbuds. It's a good idea to upgrade those bass-deprived, ill-fitting earbuds to earphones, and our Ultimate Guide to Headphones is a good place to start your search for the right pair.User InterfaceiOS 4 is a joy to behold. Things move quickly and smoothly, and they look great. Navigating almost all of the player's menus requires only icon tapping, but when text- or password-entry are required the on-screen keyboard swiftly appears and is, after some practice, a piece of cake to use. The horizontal keyboard is wider and easier to use for most people. Just as it is on the iPhone, it automatically switches orientation depending upon how you hold the player. And there's an accelerometer lock--scroll far left under the active apps menu to find its icon--press it to enable the feature. Moving and organizing icons is a snap, and multitasking is as simple as double-clicking on the Home button to see what other apps you currently have running and tapping an icon to return to an app, which will appear in the state you last left it. If you are familiar with the iPhone, you already know this. (A newer IOS 5 will be released with 200+ features whichwill make the software way better!)CameraEquipping the iPod touch with two cameras takes it to a new level. The rear-facing camera records video in HD (720p), up to 30fps, capturing audio through the rear panel mic. Still photos max out at 960 by 720 pixels. The front-facing camera, intended for FaceTime video chat, offers lower resolutions: VGA-quality for photos and videos, again, up to 30fps.Camera operation couldn't be more intuitive. An onscreen slide control toggles between still and video camera modes, and an icon in the lower left takes you to your gallery, where you can peruse your photos and videos. Video footage plays back onscreen with a scroll tool that shows a thumbnail timeline of your footage, making skipping to a certain spot easy. You can trim your footage on the player by dragging your finder over the thumbnail timeline of the footage and selecting segments to cut, but we were only able to do very basic editing because the iMovie app was not available for iPod touch prior to publishing this review. (Apple expects it to be available soon.)Capturing video is achieved by pressing the red record button onscreen when in video camera mode, and tapping it again to end recording. The screen acts as your viewfinder and everything moves along in real time without stuttering. Low-light situations will make for some noisy footage, but in well-lit scenarios, the touch's video looks colorful and crisp. Uploading your video to YouTube or sending it as an e-mail attachment, provided you have a Wi-Fi connection, is made easy with a button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen that walks you through a streamlined process to do either.For the most part, still images are impressive for a non-dedicated, low-resolution camera, but the biggest shortcoming is the absence of a flash, which makes low-light--particularly back-lit--scenarios rather challenging. You get 5x digital zoom for photos, which is activated by moving the slider on the screen above the on-screen shutter button, but zooming in creates noticeable artifacts. Landscape shots in adequate lighting look amazingly sharp, and well-lit portraits look fantastic provided, again, that you don't zoom in too far. Like videos, photos can be sent out immediately via e-mail, or you can assign a photo to be your new wallpaper or a friend's contact photo, all by pressing the lower left-hand button when viewing your image.FaceTimeSince the iPod touch is not a phone, it can't use phone numbers for FaceTime video chats, instead, it uses e-mail addresses. iOS 4.1, which enables e-mail address use in FaceTime, wasn't publicly available before we published this review, so I was only able to test the feature with reps from Apple. That said, I was using my home Wi-Fi network in New York City while video chatting with them in their Cupertino offices, and was blown away by the results. Images were crisp and clear, and I could understand everything my chat partner was saying, and never was a call dropped.Audio and VideoNavigating the music menus on the iPod touch is completely intuitive. First off, there are so many ways to do it--using CoverFlow, searching Artist or Song, or perusing playlists. Apple has made everything fast and easy--scroll song or artist lists by dragging a finger or skip ahead to a letter on the scrollable alphabet on the right side of the screen. The Now Playing view is a showcase for album art, and you can play music while you surf the Web, view photos, or even play games.By itself, the iPod touch is a fine audio device--plug in a pair of good-quality headphones and you won't be disappointed with the frequency range and overall audio quality. To my continuing disappointment, Apple still offers its stock, subpar earbuds, while rival manufacturers like Samsung and Sony instead bundle decent-quality earphones. Audiophiles listening to Lossless tracks on the touch will be best served by leaving the EQ off. The settings Apple provides are presets, there's still no user-customizable EQ. Extra features like Shake to Shuffle, Volume Limit, and Sound Check can all be enabled or disabled easily.The iTunes Store can be accessed via Wi-Fi for on-the-spot music and video purchases, and with new 99-cent TV show rentals, watching television content, albeit from limited partners, is now more affordable, as well. Video looks amazing on the new display. YouTube and Netflix will not look as sharp as video purchased from the iTunes Store, of course, but the speed with which video can be cued up without stuttering is impressive. Obviously, this is dependent, like many things on the iPod touch, on the strength of your Wi-Fi signal.File support remains similar to past models. For audio, supported codecs include AAC (protected and unprotected), HE-AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible, Apple Lossless, AIFF and WAV. Still no FLAC, which is still a bummer for audiophiles. For video, the player can handle H.264 up to 720p30, MPEG-4 up to 640 by 480 at 30fps, and motion JPEG. Also, if you use the Dock Connector to VGA Adapter (not included), you can play 1024 by 268 H.264 files. JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, PSD (Mac only) and PNG photo files are supported.The touch integrates Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR and 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, though 802.11n only operates on the 2.4GHz band. Nike+ iPod support is also included for those who want to use the touch to help keep in shape.Gaming and AppsWith the addition of FaceTime as well as Ping, the music-focused, social-networking feature for iTunes 10, it's clear that Apple wants the iPod experience to be a social one. And now there's Game Center, a new feature that encourages you to find a friend--either someone you know or a stranger with an iPod touch or an iPhone--to play real-time games. Your success (or failure) earns you a ranking you can use for bragging rights or to seek out opponents with similar skill levels. Unfortunately, during our review period, Game Center wasn't yet populated with games, but we'll test it as soon as it's up and running.Meanwhile, the App Store, which is accessed via Wi-Fi, is loaded with single-player, accelerometer-driven games like Zombie Highway, for example, that look fantastic on the Retina display. There are more than 250,000 apps with a range far too wide to detail here. If you're familiar with the iPhone or iPod touches past, you know the possibilities are endless.Web and E-MailSurfing in Safari on the iPod touch remains the best Internet experience on any portable media player out there. Last year's Zune HD ($219.99, ) came closest, but it still didn't quite match up. Some competitors, like Archos with its Archos 7 Home Tablet ($199.99, ), have started testing the tablet markets, but even those browsers, with their larger screens, are no match for the simplicity and speed of the Safari multi-touch experience on the touch. Given Apple's stance on Flash support, you shouldn't expect it on any iPod or iPhone anytime soon, and that's the single advantage competing mobile browsers can offer.E-mail remains easy to customize and use--AOL, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Microsoft Exchange, and mobileMe remain options in the mail section. iOS 4 allows for multiple accounts to be synced via Exchange--a new development. So while Gmail won't push mail independently, you can set it up--along with other accounts--via Exchange to push notifications to the iPod's home screen. (AOL, MobileMe, and Yahoo push messaged without the aid of Exchange.) Currently, there's no iWork app for the iPod touch so you can't download attached documents, though you can view them. But that's likely to change.Battery Life and ConclusionsApple rates the battery life for the iPod touch at an impressive 40 hours for audio and seven hours for video. We ran three different battery rundown tests. With Wi-Fi on, and the screen constantly on (meaning Auto-Lock is disabled) and audio playing, we got a reasonable four hours and 25 minutes. With Wi-Fi off and the screen going dark (Auto-Lock set to one minute), we got a great result: 47 hours and 25 minutes. For video playback with the screen brightness at maximum and with no Wi-Fi on, we got one hour and 41 minutes--not enough time to watch a full movie, in most cases. Using lower brightness levels would seem to be necessary for extended video playback.There are very few devices left that you can actually compare directly with the iPod touch. Many manufacturers have thrown in the towel and are taking on slightly less daunting targets, like the nano or the shuffle ($49, ), or are instead focusing on tablets. The only real problem with the touch is its high price--especially if you want a decent amount of storage. But with an entry point of $229, you do get a camera, HD video recorder, music and video player, portable gaming console, Web browser, e-mail, and app device in one slick, pocket-size package. There's just no other portable media player that can do what the iPod touch can do.
5	1307750400	There's a reason why these things rule the mp3 player market.If you've got one, you know just how fantastic a device they are.So very versatile. Clearly, the device is excellent: the build quality is great, and the screen resolution is fantastic - though the tech for the Retina display for the iPod touch is slightly less impressive than that of the iPhone. Check Engadget for details on that.In nearly every regard, I find myself loving this device.While I don't consider myself any kind of "fanboy" for any company - the very idea of that to me is just absurd and foolish - I do find that I've gravitated towards products from certain companies. Mostly it's just because you find something that works, and you go with it.That's the case here - I've found myself with a Mac, and iPad2, and now this iPod touch.The iPod is a very sweet little device in its own right - but lets not kid ourselves - it's still pretty pricey.You can certainly find other mp3 players that will do the job for less money. And several of those have nice features like fm receivers and the sort included, which iPod's have never done.But lets be clear. When it comes down to it... very few devices do out of the box what these things do - and even fewer nearly half as well. Add in the app store - and the possible functions of the device are nearly limitless.I do find myself having to be careful how much content I put on this particular device - having only the 8GB capacity. But then, even with my old 20GB iPod classic, I was only using like 8-9GB total. Granted, that was ALL music, but looking back, I had a ton of stuff on there that I simply didn't listen to. With this device, I've re-assessed what content I include on it. Pretty nice to be able to start including pics and videos on it.That brings me to the cameras. They're just ok. They do the trick. I've seen worse - like on my old-style "dumb"phone, but I've clearly seen better too - like on nearly any new smartphone.But honestly - the cameras really do work well enough. I've taken some pretty good pics, and the video capture has been good enough that I capture great vids of my kids, as well as do video chat over my home network. Just don't expect the clarity you're getting on your dedicated digital cameras.The wifi capability of the device has been great thus far - works perfectly on my home network. No complaints. One recommendation though - turn OFF the Wifi if you're taking the device where you aren't in a network. It continues to look for a wifi network, and will drain your battery faster. Otherwise, battery life is very, very good.If you have a smartphone, you're obviously not going to be needing a device like the iPod Touch. But if you're like me, and simply cannot abide the idea of paying $70+/month to the wireless companies for the use of those lovely devices (with the required data-plans!), then this is a great option.Oh yeah! I recently had my Garmin GPS unit stolen from my truck - and though the iPod doesn't have a built in GPS, I've ordered a bluetooth GPS unit that reportedly works perfectly with this unit! So I'll be using this device to track my runs and bike rides shortly as well.I'll update my review here with the bluetooth capability after I've had a chance to see how that new unit works with this one.Over all - I highly recommend the 4th gen iPod touch to anyone.
5	1307750400	This is the next best thing to an iPhone. The smaller camera and lack of a cellular radio make up for the much cheaper price. Everything else just works!
5	1307750400	The 4th Generation iPod touch rules.  I have 2 wonderful kids.  Both deserving of an iPod touch.  And you know, to keep up with the Jones, I bought 2 iPod touches.  But they needed the 32 Gig because the 8 Gig would not be good enough.  Okay, being the best dad in the world (that's what my kids call me) I bought it for them.  They're all excited but wait, that's just the tip of the iceburg.  Now I have to get Itune cards so they can buy songs and apps.  $50 Itune cards a piece.  They do their thing and show me how impressive it is.  Well, I have a very nice smartphone that I also use for music and apps.  But after seeing how sweet the iPod touch is, I was sold.  I broke down and got myself one, but I got the 8 Gig.  Hindsight, get atleast the 32 Gig because it fills up fast.  I began loading songs, apps and videos.  I also accessorized with a very nice hard case, portable ipod speaker docks and car mounts.  I really don't know how I ever lived without one.  It's like when I look back to when I was just a boy, how did we ever survive without central air conditioning, dishwasher, or and ice maker.  Sure it gets expensive but if you rationalize and budget, it less than a dollar a day for a year.  If you're a kid, tell your parents instead of going on the annual vacation, can I please have an iPod Touch?  Roundtrip airfare is about $300 each person and hotel rooms are about $200 a night and don't forget about the cost of dining out each night.  It's a win-win situation for everyone.  Everyone except the airline companies, hotels, Disney resorts, restuarants, etc. you get the idea.
5	1307750400	My daughter was sooo happy to get this for her birthday.  It's the best price we found, it got to us quickly, and we have been very satisfied!  Thanks, Amazon!
5	1307664000	I purchased the ipod because I wanted to download books.  I am an avid reader and enjoy having it read to me.  This is my first experience with an ipod.  When I recieved it, I was surprised to have to go to my computor to download the programs for set up and was disappointed it didn't have the instructions with it, instructing me to download the instruction manual to my computor.  It took me a couple hours to get all completed and I am still learning about what it is capable of.  I did purchase an accessory so I could just plug it in to an outlet and charge it since I am not always around my computor.  Still learning and am enjoying hearing the books I have downloaded.
5	1307664000	Wow so small and yet so powerful with Skype, Yahoo messenger, FaceTime, VPN, Exchange Email and you can even access files located on the server shared drives. This litlle thing is amazing, with two cameras one on front and one on the back, the hd video recording is pretty good, but the pictures quality is really bad compared with the video quality. The retina display has relay good resolution and picture quality. I recommend this product to anyone.
5	1307664000	Bought this for my girlfriend so we could keep in touch over skype and IM. there's not an off-contract cellphone out there that can match its features for the price. believe me, i've looked. its great for those who hate contracts, but want to keep in touch around the home/office over wifi. personally, i use an optimus t android phone on a prepaid plan and over wifi, while she opted for the ipod touch + dumb phone (aka normal cell phone) combo. the battery life is a little shorter than a day, but she has music playing all day on it. the screen is amazing. if you're on the fence, just get it. you'll wonder how you did without one for so long.
4	1307577600	I have owned this ipod for about six months now. I realy like this device this is just amazing. I was either going to get this or a zune hd, but i didnt realy see very many apps out for the zune so i went with the ipod  its just awesome the only downside to this device is the lack of storage 6.5 gigs is not enough for me but i know now that when i get another one in 2-3 years to get a 32 gig.
5	1307491200	You can say I'm a newbie but this is the first i-thing I've ever had, and I'm satisfied with each.
5	1307404800	I love my iPod Touch.  You can access so many things....camera, email, apps, games, podcasts, etc..... without the monthly expense of an iPhone.  It was well worth its price for my wants and needs.
3	1307404800	I bought this item for a Christmas gift and this item works great and plays music very well when needed.
5	1307404800	Look at the title page. I believe that is enough convincing. Just buy the otter box other wise it gets cracked pretty easy just like mine, but thanks to apple insurance I got a new one.
5	1307318400	I received this within in the reasonable time. I just love it! I'm not much of an apple person, so I don't use iTunes and therefore have no music on it. But everything else is in perfect working order.  Very happy with my purchase. :)
3	1307318400	Well, the I pod touch is real good. Apple tell you that is a 8GB, but what they don't tell you is that, they will take 2GB for the new OS and you will end up with 6GB for werever you want, and that's no good.So if you are cool with that, go get and buy the 8GB I pod. but think that you will have only 6GB. it cost to much for only 6GB. if I only knew that before, I will get the 16GB.Apple iPod touch 8 GB (4th Generation) NEWEST MODEL
1	1307318400	Ok let me start this review off with dont buy this i have one and it just wont sync with my laptop so im very disappointed im just gonna grab me an ipod nano (5th generation) F.Y.I Apple just lost a customer.very disappointed...
5	1307232000	EXCELLENT!  This is my first I-pod and I really love all the different things it does. I watch my first netflix movie just yesterday.
5	1307059200	I've had it only for a few weeks, but it has already revolutionized the way I listen to music, check email, play games, take/send pictures, etc. I don't think I can ever be bored again, especially with the constant influx of new, free apps.
5	1307059200	bought for my 8 year old and it is great for all of us easy use with pc and charges nicely too...we recommend this
1	1306972800	Bought the device to replace my aging mp3-player, but found out that the device is rather useless without iTunes. Which is a pity, since I don't use windows nor OS X. So, will wait for it to be jailbroken first.It would have been nice for the device to at least act as regular usb mass storage device, but no. That would've been too easy.
3	1306886400	I've had my iPod for a little over 6 months and my whole family liked it.  I used a lot of educational apps with my kids and liked all the ways I could use while running errands.Yesterday, my son was playing games and announced that the battery had died.  It showed the apple logo the way it does when it's dead, so I plugged it in to charge it.  A day later he still showed the logo and had no charge at all.  A web search has let us know that this is EXTREMELY common and there doesn't seem to be any good answer about how to recover it.  Apple has instructions on how to recover it at iTunes, but that didn't work (and from what I've read online it doesn't work for most people).I had vacation photos and videos that I hadn't downloaded yet which will now be lost forever.  It's still under warranty, but I was told that I'd have to send it in and probably just get a new (refurbished) blank one in return.  Since I hadn't synched it on iTunes, all of my apps and personal information are all lost.I didn't synch it yet because I found out too late that if you download apps from two different accounts and then synch it on iTunes, it deletes all the apps that are from the other account.  My husband had purchased a bunch of apps himself on his iTunes account on it and I had purchased my own, so once I synched it I would have to lose all of either his or my apps.  I guess it would have been worth it in retrospect.  I know a lot of things for next time.In the meantime, I've lost all of my apps, my pictures, my videos, my personal notes, my pregnancy tracker info..... for absolutely no reason whatsoever.  It just stopped working, and that's apparently typical.  Six months of life is just not cool.
1	1306800000	very disapointed, i havent had the ipod 3 months and it quit working :-( this totally sucks dont have money to waste like this!
4	1306713600	I can not get enough of my I Pod touch 4th generation. I treat it like a new born baby I have it with me 24/7. It is so versatile.
5	1306713600	Bought this iPod 4 th generation for my daughters 8th bday she loves it!!!She takes pics with it, FaceTime with iPhone, plays games, it has it all in one!Best present to give!
4	1306713600	The IPOD we received was defective.  Since it was under warranty, we worked directly with Apple to get a replacement.  My daughter had to wait an extra week or two, but we got a suitable replacement from Apple.
4	1306627200	It is just lovable. One thing I do not like about it is that you can listen to the music for quite a long time but the battery tends to run out quicker if you use apps and have them running on the background.
1	1306627200	WELL, I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE THE SELLER NEVER SEND ME THE IPOD, I LOST THE IPOD AND MY MONEY.
1	1306368000	When I got my IPOD touch 4th Gen. I started using it and then tried the camera then suddenly it froze. I tried to reset it then again it froze( that is same day I got it). Then had to drive 30 minutes during a tornado to an Apple store to get a replacement. I will never buy from amazon again.
4	1306368000	My son bought this with his saved up money so he could have games to play in school on game day.  He complains there's not enough free apps.  He's happy with the actual ipod except he has to charge the battery constantly.  For the money it's was definately worth it.
5	1306281600	Have two now, one for the 9 yr old and one for the 6 yr old son.  They both love them.  This has eliminated the "mom can I play with your iphone" question.  They now can play anything on their ipod touch that they could on my iphone.  I bought otterbox cases for them to add some form of protection b/c the 6 yr old drops things quite frequently.  So far so good.
5	1306195200	Is very nice.  Wish the screen wouldn't get so dirty though.  Perhaps a screen cover could come with it.  Had to buy one separately.
5	1306195200	this ipod was amazing and it is super fast with my wifi dont pass this up cuz you'll never enjoy the awesomeness of this product
1	1306195200	When my old traditional IPod died, I immediately decided to purchase another as I used it constantly to listen to music and audiobooks downloaded from my local library.  Instead of buying a new traditional IPod however, I was seduced by the IPod Touch and all the new apps and features, even at the expense of a great deal of memory. So I purchased the Touch and found I was no longer able to download audiobooks from the library.  After many frustrating hours online, on the phone with the library and the representative from the intermediary audiobook software and three trips to my local Apple genius bar, Apple finally admitted that it would not work.  Very kindly, they allowed me to exchange my IPod Touch for a new traditional IPod which works beautifully.  So if you want to "borrow" audiobooks from your library - do not buy the IPod Touch.
5	1306108800	I have this product for about 6 months and it's simply amazing, I bought it only to browse the net with wi-fi, but now I run my whole life on it with all the fantastic apps out there. It's the best thing I ever bought for my money. Another plus is that the build is strong - it fell on the floor many times and it didn't get damaged.
1	1306108800	Ipod is good, except for the fact that upon purchase the owner should've informed me that the battery needs to be replaced and then I wouldn't have purchased this item.  It's not worth the amount that I paid for to go through the hassle of sending it to Apple with the back and forth of my efforts.
1	1306022400	i got this ipod from amazon as a christmas present. completely loved it. never droped it doesnt have a scratch on it.. 4 months later... screen goes blank and completely freaking broke. wtf.  not worth the price if its that poorly made. hopfully i cfan still use the warranty but i dont think it even came with a paper. probably better off getting electronics from walmart.
3	1305849600	I bought this for my wife as she wanted something to replace her aging Palm.  At first glance (what sold her) is Apple makes a very attractive (albiet not functional) package.  The shiny aluminum back (scratches and dents easily, hard to hold and collects smudges), the clean unencombered face (doesn't support screen savers, is shiny and always glares, constantly wiping off smudges, only one navigation button vs Droid with 4), no power cube, cradle, or case included... Only documentation included is a little 'getting started' folder.  You can download a complete manual but it's nearly useless. If you want to learn how to operate this you have to search the Internet for other's experiences and insight.All buyers should be warned that you will forever be at Apple's mercy.  They will have their hand in your pocket forever.  This device is highly dependent upon installing their buggy iTunes program on your computer and if you have a PC it will never be the same if you do load it.  If you don't believe me conduct a quick search and find out how bad iTunes actually is.Almost everything you do - sync, buy or install music, load apps, move files.... - requires iTunes.Many of the features they advertise apply only to the Apple community.  Forget Facetime unless everyone has an Apple.They claim 40 hours on a battery.  That's bull.  Maybe 40 hours of standby but I doubt that also.  My wife uses it for perhaps 1-2 hours a day and the battery is half done after that.My Droid is far superior and much more flexible.
5	1305763200	I love my new Itouch 8gb I've wanted to get a itouch since the first one came out about 4 years ago I believe, and have not been able to until now! And I'm glad the wait was worth it! I definitely recommend this product!
5	1305676800	Man does this thing do everything listen to music play,video games,watch videos crystal clear, wifi ready, take notes, calculator. I can't wait to recieve my ipod I am definitely using it for school
5	1305331200	I am very satisfied with my purchase. It works wonderfully and I use it all the time. It wasa a great buy.
4	1305244800	My daughter loves her new IPOD touch that she got for her birthday....the only thing I would like to see different is the battery life as it goes dead pretty fast especially if using the face time chat.
5	1305244800	This is the best iPod i could ever ask for! It is fast and thin. One thing i really like about it is that it's screen is very bright and not dull. And the cameras are very good. You can facetime people and  that's also a cool feature and the speakers are real high quality. I really recommend this even though it's kinda pricy.
5	1305158400	First, I'm a PC guy and I mostly own Sony products. SO when I say this is the greatest gadget I ever owned, I hope it has some weight...Pros:The screen resolution is astounding....The internet speed is as fast if not faster then all my other computers and gadgets.The build quality is the best of anything I own..with glass screen and polished aluminium body, it's incredibly pleasing to eyes and to hold it in hands.The video quality is unmatched, again, with anything I own.Exception of games, Apps are great.Cons:The contrast or black level is almost same as my six year old PSP 2000.....The overall audio experience is mediocre at best..user interface can be more elegant and the sound quality of video and music files are just barely adequate.Itunes is a horrible pig of a software.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but Itunes will NOT let you transfer YOUR own files back to YOUR own computer?I mainly bought this for NETFLIX, but the streamed movies looks very VERY pixelated after two minuts in movies.suggestions to Apple:Stop with the incremental upgrades!Please be a good American and start manufacturing it in US and I will gladly pay more.For Ifans sake, spend another quarter and add two more speaker for stereo!! I don't want to wear headphone all the time.Make the screen at least 4 inch!Better battery life. Really, Ipod doesn't need to be thinner..lighter maybe but not thinner....so please put a bigger battery in next iteration.On related battery note, IPOD doesn't have an auto power down timer,stand by, or screen sleep function!?! W. T. H...."no name two bit disposable toy $20 MP3 players" have it to prolong its battery.Implement real buttons to appease real gamers then I guarantee you'll make billions more.Add "real" GPS.Look to Google Chrome for your inspiration for Itunes ...in other words, make it lighter and more elegant.Buy Cowon or Sony Walkman's tech for audio quality or at least study it.  Until then, DON'T even think about associating Ipod as a music device...Please PLEASE consolidate music file control scheme...seems like there must be hundreds if not thousands of way of pausing and playing your music files. It's just annoying and confusing....more doesn't always mean better.  Design 101, "Keep.It.Simple.S-----!!!"Final Thought:I'm really looking forward to 7" IPAD 3 with "super" retina display" and perhaps Ipod 6 or 7 with stereo and better audio....but with Asus Transformer Prime, Nook Tab, and Amazon Fire out...It's serious SERIOUS hustle time for Apple.  If you have open mind and celebrate differences, please check out Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 for consideration.  If I knew sooner, I might have bought that instead...Lastly, a suggestion to my fellow consumers.  Unless you only listen to music and have few apps, please buy at least 32g. My puny 8g ran out very fast with all the TV shows and movies I watch on it....UPDATE: 9/10/2011My bad...I upgraded my internet bandwidth to 1.5mb(gasp)....and it solved the buffering issues and pixelated pic quality on Netflix App..I'm going to up one more star to perfect five star rating on this amazing device.
3	1305072000	I bought this IPod Touch fourth generation for my brother and his wife as a 48th wedding anniversary gift along with a one year subscription to Audible.com. That is when the fun began.They are in their seventies. All the kings horses could not get the IPod to work.Short version they went to an Apple store and it was a defective IPod cable. Apple replaced it on the spot w/o charge.[[ASIN:B001FA1O0O Apple iPod touch 8 GB (4th Generation) NEWEST MODEL]I own an earlier edition of the same Touch. I have eye issues This w/ Audible has allowed me to read 99 books since late 2008.POINT: Apple Check the stems, not just the fruit.
5	1305072000	My daughter lost the other one.... at least this one can be tracked!!... Amazing quality, cameras are great, sound as always, high standards for the most reopresentative Company of the decade.
2	1305072000	At first I was very happy to recieve this product but upon use there are several flaws.  You can tell that the screen was cracked and then tried to be repaired.  Also there is old information on it from the previous owner and I can not remove it.  I guess it works for my 12 year old but will NOT purchase this way again!!!!
5	1304985600	I got this for my son and he likes it very much. There are lots of apps and games that keep him entertained without spending one extra cent yet. I have a Skype account and I downloaded the app and can now make calls over wi-fi without the actual phone. The one thing I don't like is the quality of pictures in the camera, pretty bad.
2	1304812800	missing accessories: earphones and ipod to usb cablemissing earphone jack plug completely, which may be why the earphone was missing ...otherwise the unit worked, less the above mentioned items.
5	1304812800	The iPod Touch is the top of its class in hand-held devices.  It is sleek, stylish, and built with an attention to detail.  It does everything the iPhone does with the exception of the phone feature (and the AT&T or Verizon contract!).  However, using facetime feature or Skype will even allow you to "call" someone.
5	1304812800	Got this to replace an older Ipod and I absolutely LOVE it!  So many great features and so much fun!
5	1304726400	My son was very happy with this ipod.  It provides enough room for him to store just about anything, mainly games.  There have not been any problems with any downloads and the battery life seems to last for the amount of time that was advertised.  I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family.
4	1304726400	Overall, it's a great product. No major flaws excepts getting good reception to the wi-fi at my home. I use it every night to listen to music before I go to bed. I would recommend this product to somebody looking for a device that can do everything except make phone calls.
4	1304640000	I bought one for both my son and myself and overall I really love the ipod touch (and so does he) but the one thing I have realized is that the 8G doesnt have much memory. I figured that 8G would be more than enough but when it comes brand new it has really only 6.5G because of all the stuff it already had loaded onto it. My sons is almost out of memory and here is what it has loaded on it : 59 songs, 63 photos, 64 apps, 1 movie, 2 epsiodes of a tv show(30 min each) and 8 mini videos he took himself (each one is under 2 min long). He now has only 497MB left. I tried downloading one more movie for him to watch and there is not enough space so it wont download. I really thought that more stuff would fit onto the ipod and now I'm wishing that I would have bought the next one up that has more memory. Other than the memory the ipod touch is amazing.
1	1304640000	Tech Support did not really help and answer my questions. I tried but no success. A waste of my money and my time. Trash. That's where you'll find my Apple product can't figure out why the Apple stock is priced so high. The Best?! on the contrary!
4	1304553600	Notifications from news, etc. doesn't work with this itouch and worked perfectly with itouch 2G. Others have same problem with notifications. Locks up and needs hard reset often. Seems to lockup in photo application which seems like software bug as pull down menu covers picture icon which then cannot be accessed until reset when pull down menu goes away and can access picture icon. Device only has 6.5 gig but is advertised as 8 gig. The extra 1.5 gig is a big chunk of memory considering the 6.5 you actually get. About 24% less memory than you think you are getting to be exact. Streaming HD video from youtube drops out and intermitant with slower DSL connections. Doesn't seem to happen with 4mbps or faster data rate. Itouch 2G never had this problem with HD on slow connections but had lower resolution display. Sharp and clear display and facetime works good and stable. Seems to use same amount of battery drain as 2G. Apple store tech help no help with these issues. Also all the background applications have to be closed every so often due to using to much resources, another bug. They should have put in more ram or select if you want the app to run in the background or not. It wouldn't let me sync with itunes that had my itouch 2G and shuffle was on to transfer my 2G contents. When plugged in only the shuffle data showed up and couldn't move over my old apps to new device despite spending hours trying to do it. The 2G app never showed up. Finally had to install new itunes on new computer then was able to transfer most of the apps over but not all. I could not uninstall the old itunes. Although it seems that it is uninstalled, the same data shows up. On Apple web page it tells how to uninstall itunes and it consisted of following 2 pages of instructions on how to do it! You cannot go in and manually delete the itunes information without following the secret page on how to uninstall the directories. Wifi printing works without a hitch but only HP e series supports the itouch 4 and the cheapest is $100 which prints very poor picture color and average looking text. The top features of this itouch is the retina display and facetime. HD movies using the back camera looks good enough and I like the fact that pictures and videos can be emailed instantly. Front facing camera is lower resolution but good for facetime because higher resolution would cause the video to lag and more delay in updating due to high resolution display. So what do I do with it. I play 3D games, facetime, email, weather, news, etc. Applications is what this device is all about and for this and retina display I give it 4 stars.
5	1304467200	I really enjoy my I-Pod Touch.  Hopefully, someday, I can invest in an I-Pad, but the I-Pod Touch suits me fine for now for what I do with it.  I was able to purchase it through Amazon for a good price too, and the ordering and delivery went well.  I use Amazon quite often for my purchases.  A great place !!!!
5	1304467200	omqq i loved it ! everything came exactly the way they described it. It was brand new with great accesories all for a great price. Also i was impress with the delivery it came sooner than i thought-couldn't get any better ! Im so glad that my first purchase at Amazon went well i am soo goin to shop here  more often ! Thank you soo  much (:
5	1304380800	Simply love this Ipod!  The main reason I wanted it was for all of the applications and the ability to facetime with Ipad and Iphone 4 users, which I use excessively with family in London.  The camera quality on facetime is amazing!
2	1304380800	I bought my iPod Touch 4th Generation, 8 GB, from Woot, a company owned by Amazon, and I have to say I'm super disappointed with the quality of this product. I'm a long-time obsessed iPod owner and after a week of owning this iPod Touch, I've gone back to using my old iPod.Here's what I didn't like about the iPod Touch: the 8 GB drive is too small, the touch screen turns out to be more of an inconvenience, the battery life is way too short and the sound quality is capped at an unacceptably low maximum.8 GB turns out to be more like 6 GB of storage space, because there has to be room to store all the software. I didn't think this would be a problem, except that the lack of space was immediately a deal-breaker. The first audio book I put on the iPod Touch was too big to be installed, and this was a standard-issued book from a company that makes audio books for blind people. For people who are interested in this option, I'll give the technical details: if you're going to listen to RFB&D; Daisy-Format audio downloaded books using their $20 special app, make sure you buy an iPod Touch with a much larger hard drive than 8 GB.The touch screen, which at first seems like a great idea, turns out to really suck. Why? Because the iPod Touch can't just be tossed into your pocket without setting off the buttons, unlike my experience with my very old video iPod, which travels very easily.The battery life, even with the wi-fi turned off, is unacceptably short. I can squeeze out at least 10 hours of heavy use in-between charges on my really old video iPod. With just music listening, the iPod Touch is dead within 2 hours. This is not good at all.The sound volume is capped at a volume way too low, compared to the ability of earlier models of iPod, and if I had bought this iPod Touch in a store, instead of online, I would have returned it for a refund. This volume capper is a deal-breaker and I'm going to hunt high and low online for a solution until I find a way to hack the volume controls into working the way I want.I tested the email option, and it was easy to set up with my Gmail account, although the on-screen keyboard was clumsy and inefficient. I won't be using my iPod Touch to read email, although this was never my intention anyways - I just wanted a music player, hopefully with the ability for a blind person in my family to listen to their special-format audio books. She's already kicked the iPod to the curb - it isn't blind-friendly. The way the iPod Touch interface changes when you click it on for the blind-user options is completely bizarre and non-intuitive.My recommendation? Save your money and buy an old iPod Nano and wait until the bugs get worked out of the machine on these iPod Touches.
5	1304294400	I bought the ipod touch for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. I think she likes playing with the free text and phone features as much as the applications and the music.She dropped the ipod on the concrete and the screen shattered. We took it to the Apple store and they gave us a new one free of charge! There seems to be only good associated with the product and the company.
5	1304121600	Based on my past experience with old Macs many years ago, I never thought iPOD touch would be good; now this product changed my mind completely about Apple.  They really did a great job in designing and manufacturing. I think the credit goes to both Apple and the contract manufacturer in Taiwan for doing a great job. One thing I still miss is the handwriting recognizer that I used to have an in iPAC (from Compaq/HP - do you still remember?) many years ago before anyone even tought about iPOD.  Anyway, it is a great product, and I hope it will be in the market for a while.
5	1304121600	I purchased my Ipod Touch 8G in January, 2011 just for fun and to see what all the fuss was about.  I use a laptop and have wireless connectivity in my home.  But I don't store music on an Ipod and don't have "smart" cell phone.  After using the Ipod Touch for a few months, all I can say is "WOW".This device is like carrying a small computer in your pocket.  I can connect to the internet wirelessly at home and anywhere I can find a public connection--library, cafe, etc.  I check my email (read and compose), facebook, Meetups, Ravelry, take pictures and movies, and with the Skype App, can video call my kids.  I have become hooked on the Angry Birds game, which is fun to do while waiting anywhere.  I have also downloaded audio books from my library to take with me when I travel.  I knit and have any pattern I am working on loaded on my Touch so I don't worry about losing it.  All this in a 2x4 inch little device I can carry with me everywhere.I considered getting a smart phone instead, but Verizon's additional mandatory monthly cost of $30/month turned me off.  It would be nice to have internet access where ever I am, but I don't need it and don't want to pay $360/year for it.  I like the fact that the Ipod Touch does not require any additional monthly costs.I compared my Touch to my friends Ipad.  It appears that my Touch does most everything the Ipad does, but the Touch is so much smaller.My son has a Droid, which does what my Touch does plus it is his cell phone. But games wear his battery down quickly.  I don't have to worry about that since my phone is separate from my Touch.If I needed to be connected to the internet at all times and have a cell phone too, I would probably stick with a smart phone and pay the extra $30/month.  But if you want a very versatile tool in a small package to carry with you, I highly recommend the Ipod Touch.So much fun!August 17, 2012 Update--Everything I said in my review still holds true.  The Ipod Touch is a quality product--really it is a tiny Ipad. I hope Apple comes out with a smaller Ipad, say a 7 inch model.  A larger screen would be nice for reading and playing games and would still be small enough to carry around easily.
5	1303948800	It came in the allotted time and condition (I ordered it new), and I'm satisfied with the overall product. It's battery life is great, the sound quality is exceptional, you save a good $20 compared to stores, and the capacity is decent. The only thing that bothered me was the quality of the camera, although it isn't bad. I strongly recommend ordering a case along with the iPod, since they cost more in-stores (if they even have them, considering it's the newest model), and help keep it looking brand new.
5	1303862400	Only issue I have is.....when I called Apple Tech. support for help, I was told that the '90 days free tech support' period has already expired !!How can this be for a brand new product, which I had to wait for delivery?
1	1303862400	I never received the product nor did the seller reply to any of my attempts to contact her.  Doesn't seem to be a relaiable source to purchase any products from.
1	1303776000	Bought product in early April. Loaded some songs. Product worked ok. Some 2 weeks later, product began playing same song over again, whether you pressed shuffle or not. Spent time updating all the software. No change in performance.Very unhappy. Guess I will take it to an Apple store and ask their opinion as nowhere on any site I can find is such a problem, or fix, addressed.
5	1303689600	The iPod Touch goes beyond a media storage device . Cutting Edge Technology , full list of functions . The best yet ! Apple Rocks !
5	1303689600	We purchased this for our daughter's birthday and she absolutely loves it. The only thing she complains about is the battery life. It dies quickly.Thanks!
5	1303516800	I got the iPod Touch for my wife, for Christmas.  We liked it so well that I bought myself one in January.  We have been very pleased and purchased an expensive cover, and shield to protect them.  Love the camera and the many choices of applications.  We have found the 8GB to be adequate.
5	1303430400	My kid loves his iPod it works great. The the iPod is a good starter for maybe an iPhone for him. Perhaps in three years 11 years old is to young for anything but a tracfone.
5	1303430400	I had the 8GB 3rd Gen iPod Touch, which many will tell you is essentially the 2nd Gen iPod Touch (The 16GB & 32GB 3rd Gen units had updated infrastructure, but the 8GB 3rd Gen did not).With this 4th Gen 8GB unit, everything runs faster and smoother.  It has a pretty good still camera, and very good video camera.  It also allows the incredibly useful multitasking feature of iOS 4 that was unavailabe on my 2nd Gen.  The Retina display is much clearer.  Just a great improvement on what was already a great product!Obviously, if you can afford it, more storage is better.  I need to regularly swap out apps, songs, and videos to keep from maxing out my 8GB.
4	1303344000	Purchasing this product through Amazon.com was painless. Seller's delivery of item was within the stated time. iPod Touch was defective upon arrival, it had many electronic gliches. I had to go to the nearest Apple store to have it evaluated. it was determined that the iPod was defective, and a new one was issued. My daugther is now enjoying her ipod. The stars ratings are hers.
3	1303257600	After I lost my iTouch4 32G I purchased a 8G version from Amazon, and it runs much slowly compare to my olde one(I mean for the big games and email). It has the same machine as 32G but the storage force it runs slowly, so if you are going to play big games and run alot mulitasking on it, go buy a 32G version. Also, it only has about 6.4GB free on a 8G iTouch.
5	1303171200	The 4th generation I-pod has been a perfect fit for what I was looking for in a mp3 player with a few extras. I like the dual side function of the camera, however, indoor pictures do not come out as well as outdoor pictures. I was aware of this when I made my decision to purchase it after reading other reviews. I downloaded the Kindle app and this is a nice addition to have if you are into e-reading. It is nice to have the smaller size when you are travelling, you don't have the bulky size of the Kindle or Nook and it is easy to read in its compact format. The only drawback to it for me is the limited functionality of the email. It comes with Yahoo as the default email and perhaps that works better but I cannot use my email the same way with the I-pod as I can on a laptop or pc. It downloads emails fast as well as other applications and files. I have not used bluetooth or the movie apps. I downloaded a game and it was hard to navigate (I am not a gamer). If you want the functionality of the I-phone and don't want a phone this is for you.
2	1303171200	I have been purchasing apple products now for well over 10 years.  I have owned the Apple Classic IPOD, numerous shuffles, and I was very excited when I initially purchased the new IPOD touch.  I have used it maybe a dozen times to listen to music.  Recently after shutting it off and then picking it back up the next day, I found the unit totally unresponsive and could not start it up or turn it on.  I tunes did not recognize it when I connected it to my apple computer.  I took it to my local brick and motar apple store and one of their staff was able to perform a reset and got it working again.  I was advised that if it happened again to simply reset it.  I find this unacceptable and feel that the quality that I have come used to in purchasing Apple products has decreased recently.  In the last 6 months I have also had two other I Pods totally quit when I went running with them.  Simply disappointed.
4	1303171200	you must buy this, if you like ipods , this one is the best of all them. but the batery is not so long, bluetooth is terrible. beside that,it is a great item!
5	1303171200	I LAUGH when I compare the display of the 4th Generation Ipod vs. the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st generation ipods. You never know how baddd the pervious displays look until you see this one!It's so HD and nice.This ipod is soooo much faster, everything loads faster. That simple.The speakers on this ipod are about 3x louder.It's thinner, and if you don't like that, get a case.Simple, best ipod out there yet.Camera quality is adequate, the video quality on this thing is smooth and hd, really nice.Battery life is long too, unless you have your brightness up to the max + play 3D games, it wont last as long as you'd please.Don't hesitate on your purchase, trust me.
5	1303171200	I recently bought this i-Pod touch 8GB, and I must say it is a multi-entertainment platform.Aside from the quality of the music, there is so much more that can be done. You can check your emails, the newest videos on YouTube, surf the web, check the weather, take photos and more! It is my preferred e-reader for comics. My personal favorites are the apps, more specifically the gaming apps. With 8GB of storage I have enough space to carry my favorite music and my games all in one place. I am simply amazed at the clarity of the graphics for the available games. The amount of versatility of the games are astounding for such a small device (compared to other gaming systems),this is especially true of my favorite game "Ultimate Spiderman: Total Mayhem". The things I can do in game rival the things one can do on the Wii, PS3, or Xbox360 (even though they might do it slightly better). Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and I am sure anyone who buys an I-Pod will have lots of fun.
5	1303084800	This IPOD is at the usual high quality level, does more than I have actually utilized, and is functioning as expected.  I use it primarily for music storage and playback, and like all Apple products, it is very user friendly and operates perfectly.  I would recommend one of these to anyone.
5	1303084800	Well... if u have an ipod touch and u go on itunes and want to download a movie, after u buy the movie, will it download onto ur ipod or be sent to your house as a dvd? im thinking about getting a movie, but i dont know what the company will do, Let me download it or send it to my house???
5	1303084800	OMG this is amazing i never thought that all this stuff could fit in to this little hand held gaming system! love the camera works awesome! i have the 2g one but there is no comparason between the two. running faster that ever love the graphics and unbeatable price!!! hope you love it!! ;)
4	1302912000	I have had fun for the most part with my new iPod, it has helped me check may email, facebook, and even handed in homework assignments when I had problems getting connected online with my laptop. I heard that you had to replace batteries in the previous iPods every so often, so I hope mine can last longer than a year. The battery life I get out of mine is about 3 and 1/2 hours. Overall I like this device, its pretty cool when waiting around for an appointment, a ride, or just chilling at home. I think if it was at $150 bucks everyone should get one.
5	1302912000	Great device.  It appears to do everything and more.  The screen is bright, the battery last a decent amount of time and everything just works.
5	1302825600	i like my iPod touch and i am very happy to buy  this one.this is working good i like its style and very easy to use thank u
5	1302825600	I bought this for my son and he is in love with it!!!  He uses it everyday.  I have even had the opportunity to use it and want to get one for myself now!!!  Great value!!!!
5	1302825600	I recently lost my iPod Nano and purchased the Touch....great investment!  Much more applications and controls.  Amazon had it priced competitively ($204 compared to $229 at Best Buy); free shipping!!! It arrived within 5 days after I ordered.  No problems thus far!!!
4	1302825600	Awesome buy, couldn't be happier, if your in between this and a brand new one I suggest getting it used, works just as well and a lot cheaper!
5	1302825600	I am enjoying all the features of ipod4. The sound and picture quality are excellent.wi fi connectivity is also very good.only feature where it could improve is the Battery Life. It is a clear winner when compared to all othertop mp3 or mp4 players
5	1302825600	Having already owned an ipod touch 3 i can greatly see the changes made to the ipod touch. First of all the retina display looks amazing better than any other pocket device avalable, and not one but two camaras! so the quality of the rear camera isnt that of a nikon professonal but its an ipod for petes sake! it doesnt have the same camers as the iphone because it would drive away customers frome the iphone,no gps for the same reason, im greatly impressed by the improvements made to the ipod from the 3g to the 4g and i would definately upgrade if u are looking into upgrading or buying an ipod.
4	1302825600	Enjoying this toy. Lotsa fun. When this thing is within range of Wi-Fi it is fast. There's one thing I see they could improve on: Battery life ain't that great.
5	1302739200	Good PartGreat memory capacityScreen quality is fantasticIt's so easy to use.Battery life lasts 1 day of full brightness.Best adviceIf you buy an iPod buy a silicone cover to protect your iPod from scratches.And if you drop your iPod with the silicon cover it likely won't break.Bad PartThe iPod can get easily scratched, I mean really easily to scratch it.So when you are buying an iPod buy it with a silicon cover and a screen protector!And if you drop your iPod with the silicon cover it likely won't break.Links for the mentioned itemsLuxmo Premium Clear Screen Protector for Apple iPod Touch 4G, 4th Generation, 4th GenPremium Black Soft Gel Silicone Skin Case Cover for Apple iPod Touch 4G, 4th Generation, 4th Gen
5	1302652800	Purchased for my wife to replace a Palm XT - has served the need very well.  She loves it!
5	1302566400	This product is absolutely amazing. Now I haven't gotten it but I've seen heard and watched them being used, and I have used them myself. I bought one but sadly it won't get to me for a week, but that is a small price to pay considering I'm getting just such an amazing device.The best part I say is the new "Retina Display" retina fits it well because it looks like it's right out of your eye, A.K.A. it looks like what it would look like out of your eyes, what you see isn't pixelated... I hope. Now Resolution, it is 960x640 If i'm correct. The only way to ever see any pixels on that are with a microscope! No joke.So the graphics are good and for once the 8, 32, and 64GB are all the same, one just has more memory than each other. So basically each one is the same as each other. That is my review, oh and with IPod Touch you get free internet unlike the Phone, so if you wanna game and facetime and stuff get an IPod Touch. Other than that I can't help ya. And this is Now being edited after I got it, it was amazing, In perfect condition. (Even though I bought a new one) The best part you ask? It even came with a 15$ Itunes card. No Joke!
5	1302480000	Pros:- There are apps for every task imaginable.- Fits in a pocket easily- decent battery lifeCons:- So small it can cramp your hand- Constant fear of scratching, dropping, breaking- Not a lot of memory space if you want apps (games) and musicBuy a model with more space if you can afford it.  A case is a necessity.  The price seems a bit steep for what you get, but there are no comparable products on the market so you can't argue with that.
5	1302393600	Bought 2 new generation I-touches for my sons 10 and 8 years old.  They love them! Fairly easy for them to use. Easy to set up. Battery has long life for music, but when they are playing games on it only last a couple of hours so if you are going on a long car trip you will need a car charger....Overrall they are very happy with them...especially free text feature since I refuse to get them a phone at their age!
5	1302393600	I was disappointed when the personalized etching that I was offered, free of charge, and requested is not to be found on the back of my new toy.  Other than that, I do love it.  I've loaded it with hundreds of Golden Oldies to play at our 45th class reunion.  Too much fun!!!
5	1302134400	Looks super sleek. Can't beat it for features. Does everything as promised.Straight out of box I zipped through it. Charged it up and just followed instruction
5	1302134400	I bought this to replace the one my son had stolen.  It was a greatr bargin and exactly what my son wanted.  Thank you.  Would purchase from this seller again.
5	1302048000	I bought 2 of these for my daughters in hopes that they would leave my iPhone alone and stop fighting over my laptop. It worked like a charm :)
3	1302048000	I had to change my iPod touch after a couple of weeks. The connectivity wasn't good and the wireless was a pain in the neck. Apple customer service suggested me to update it. I did it hoping for some improvements but nothing happened. Actually, it was worse than before as other problems showed up. Then I decided to talk to Amazon.The customer service was great as usual. They replaced it with a brand new one.As soon as I have time to try it I will update my review (hopefully changing it for the better).
4	1302048000	Hello All the Ipod touch is a great device you have probably read about all the features. So I will go straight to the cons. Battery life. What is the point of having a portable device if it cant hold a charge for a respectable amount of time . I barely get 3 hours on mine and its brand new. Yes even with wifi turned off anyway its seems to vary depending on what function your using.  playing music with wifi off seems best. But when I play Sentinel (GREAT TOWER DEFENSE GAME) with wifi on battery goes out quickly. Hope they can improve on that and NO I do not want to buy a Power-monkey to attach to it for extended power lets not forget its supposed to be a portable device.Second squabble is its too damn slippery would it have been hard to but matte finish somewhere on the gripped edges? Its like holding a wet bar of soap. I Will buy a rubberized case to solve that. Perhaps design one myself.
4	1301961600	I do not want an iphone but I am happy with my ipod touch.  it's really fun and since i got it today I haven't been able to put it down!  So far i haven't had any issues with it and it's just fun to watch my three year old play some of the games.  would definitely recommend this!April,2012Decided to update the review.  There have been reports that the home button stops working and my niece has one and hers stooped working and I dont play with mine much.  I hate iTunes and can't stand their constant need for updates that sometimes improves but more times than good its been a bad update.  I definitely don't care to mess with the iPod and its 100% my daughters which she doesn't even want since the screen sensitivity is lacking and I've been playing with my android.  For those apple lovers it is a good thing you can text and play games and if you take online classes your school may have an app for that.  However the downside hard to out things on it and home button issues.  My daughter prefers my thunderbolt and Xoom.  But like mentioned before to each their own.
5	1301961600	i love my new ipod, love the camera and everything, i wish i could use it as a flash drive to storage files, and other things.
1	1301961600	My cat loves this thing. It spins so well on my floor, he can flip it over, and the shiny side is just about the best thing that's ever happened to him. I also could have gotten him a super ball for $0.25 at the grocery store. After swearing off Ipods after watching my Ipod Mini bite the dust in 2006, I let down my guard long enough to get sucked in to the Ipod Touch revolution. 4 months later, I pop open my Ipod's case, plug it in to my car adapter, and voila - nothing happens. It will not turn on, it will not do anything. I sent my precious pod back to Apple, only to recieve an email two days later informing me it had water damage, and will be returned to me as is. And here, I scratch my head and think to myself, how the eff does an ipod who lives double-cased become damaged by water? So I bring it my local Apple Store, who shows me that the indicator strip is a lovely shade of pink, but that when the cover is popped off, it appears to be entirely healthy.So here I sit, with a pathetic chunk of expensive failed technology and I will tell you from this day forward, I will not succumb to any technology trend if it means sacrificing quality and craftsmanship, which I believe is the jist of this disaster.When it worked, it was pretty cool. The sound is good, the music menus are moderately navigatable, although not to the extent of the classic/mini/nano. No one can complain about games, facebook, email, weather at your fingertips, but my blackberry does that too. I think it is designed for a larger hand, and I found that using it single-handed was nearly impossible. So coolness factor is a plus, I think as a mini computer/entertainment system it's functional, The music set-up and overall usability in terms of size and ease of navigation leaves something to be desired, and quality is as poor as it gets. Under no circumstances will I be replacing this with another touch, or another Apple product of any sort.
5	1301875200	I resisted buying anything "i" pod/phone/pad/book thinking that it is all hype and no real advancement...man I was wrong. I would give my left arm for this ipod..it is amazing how advanced the technology has gone with people like me still living in the world of emails and chats when facetime and iphone are the things we have already achieved. I was waiting for the jet-pack to be invented..this is our generations jet-pack. Thanks you Apple. You have a new fan.
5	1301875200	I bought this item, upgrading from an iPhone 3g with no service, (essentially an iPod Touch). I am impressed with the front and back cameras, and the retina display is awesome. But my main complement is the speed. Multitasking is essential! I love it, it allows me to do things I never thought possible on my new touch. It seems to make it more and more like a pocket computer. I can have 30 apps open, all running, at a time before it even starts to get a little slow. I have bought and installed iMovie, and that makes my videos taken with my iPod made more awesome. I absolutely LOVE this product, and no matter if your purpose is buisness, schoolwork, email and music, or just plain fun, YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO!!!!1 million stars.
5	1301875200	i am really enjoying my ipod touchholds everthing i want and then somei recommend it for everyone
4	1301875200	I'm more than pleased with my iPod's featured and innovative functionalities.  Looking forward for the next iphone version from Apple.
5	1301875200	The whole process from shopping to delivery was none less than excellent! I am really enjoying what this i-pod can do. My main reason was to stream in netflix. Going this way made it possible to go to any tv. Since then I am loving what this device can do and I have alot more to checkout. Thanks for the  excellent service!
5	1301788800	We bought this product for my 10 year old daughter and she loves it. It is easy to use, easy to learn and a great learning tool for todays technology. The battery life could be better.
4	1301788800	So, I didn't actually buy my ipod touch from amazon. I bought it in the apple store, but whatever. So anyway, I was sitting on a tile floor 2 days after I got my iPod, and it fell off of my leg, a distance of 6 inches, and cracked the screen! If this is supposed to be more durable than the 3rd gen iTouch, Apple needs to review the definition of "durable". My 3rd gen iTouch had a dead backlight, but the thing was virtually indestructible! I literally threw it on the ground like 30 times and it still worked, and didn't even get a scratch! I hope Apple redoes the screen durability in their next iPod and iPhone.
5	1301788800	I hemmed and hawed for months trying to convince myself I needed an iPad.  The price kept scaring me away.  To me an iPad is a toy with marginal "useful" benefits.  By "useful" I mean those things that it would do that I could use in my argument to convince my wife buying one was the right thing to do.  I could never quite come up with adequate reasons. Enter the iPod Touch.  The iPod Touch is everything I was looking for in an iPad, but at less than half the price (for the smallest model).  I already have a laptop so I wasn't looking for computing capabilities.  I was looking for a toy that had some beneficial use.I love the iPod Touch.  It's small enough to take anywhere and with the abundance of wifi hotspots, I'm rarely without a signal.  With certain apps, I can even text and make limited calls meaning that my iPod Touch can substitute for a messaging device (I can't quite call it a phone) that I can communicate with.The iPod Touch is a small wonder machine.  I can watch movies on my Netflix account, send emails, listen to music and a ton of other things.  True, many of the things I do on it are entertainment, but they help me pass the time while waiting for someone to arrive or before my son's school events start.  To me, the iPod Touch is the perfect substitute for the iPad I can never convince myself to buy.  Granted, it is considerably smaller than an iPad, but that's part of the appeal.  It fits in my pocket, while an iPad is cumbersome in comparison.I fully endorse the iPod Touch.  I bought the small 8gb version, but those who like to store video will need something considerably larger.  I do not intend to bog my device down with stored video, I have an external hard drive on my laptop with all the video I need.  The iPod Touch is meant to be a mobile device and its compact size makes it the perfect toy/tool to bring with on any outing involving downtime.  It won't replace my laptop, and it won't replace my Kindle.  I truly believe there is a need for people to have multpile gadget devices that serve multiple functions.If you're in the same predicament I was in, not being able to fully justify spending between $500-850 for an iPad or other tablet device, consider strongly the iPod Touch.  The 4th generation model will amaze and satisfy.  For under $230 you can have the world at your fingertips.
1	1301788800	I was trying to replace the Ipod touch for my granddaughter.  Her's was stolen about 2-3 weeks after she received it from me for Christmas.  So, I found a great price on Amazon and bought it for her again.  I could not wait to surprise her with it on a trip we were taking.  Well, it never came, I could not reach the seller, I called Amazon and they said they would make it right and all they did was credit my account.  I never heard another word regarding this terrible experience.  I was very disappointed in the customer service on this issue.  Historically I have had great service from Amazon, and I do spend a LOT of money with Amazon.  I had hoped they would contact me and say we are sorry for your bad experience, you are a loyal customer and we would like to sell you a replacement ipod touch at a discounted amount.  But no, they just keep writing me asking me to review my recent purchase.  So Amazon, here it is.  (No offense Apple - your products are WONDERFUL!)
5	1301702400	my brother lost his last one - was able to use the same account and download all his library- plus this one has many more features
4	1301616000	There are plenty of reviews saying what the ipod can do and what it looks like so I'll skip that.  What I was so concerned with was should I buy the iPhone or iPod??  If you don't need the internet connected to the device 24/7, then you can save alot of money.  1 purchase plus any apps you may buy, but the apps it comes with are pretty much all I need, is about 200$ one time.  The iPhone is about 200$,  plus 90$ a month to also have the phone and the internet constantly connected to it (unlimited plan).  So it is a great item for organizing your life on one device.  That is pretty much undisputed.  All you  really need to ask yourself is do I want a phone and the internet connection all in one device??  If you do, just get an iPhone cause they do the same thing minus the phone and allways beeing connected to the internet.  If you would rather pay one time and not have the phone and internet constantly connected buy the ipod cause you can save the monthly fee if you just use wifi when ever your in a hotspot and for the phone just use your old cheap one.  I bought this for my girlfreind cause she already has internet at home and wifi at work. So it suits her life syle for now.  If things change she may want everything in one device so she doesn't have to keep track of 2.  To sum it up = Just figure out what would suit your life style more and if you want to keep track of 2 devices instead of one.  I also had absolutely no problems with shipping or payment and the device works and looks as advertised...great. For myself, I would probably want everything in one device (iPhone) cause I like simplicity and am sometimes willing to pay a monthly price for it. Hope this helps someone who had the same concerns I did.
5	1301529600	Es el mejor dispositivo port&aacute;til de entretenimiento que existe en el mercado. Si le colocaran un modulo 3G para navegar sin necesidad de plan de voz (como en el IPHONE) ser&iacute;a el dispositivo perfecto. la velocidad de carga, la nitidez de la imagen, la fluidez, todo lo hace el mejor dispositivo del mercado.Respecto al audio, el parlante incorporado suena muy pobremente pero es que este dispositivo esta dise&ntilde;ado para usar aud&iacute;fonos no para utilizar el alto parlante. Con los aud&iacute;fonos he logrado escuchar notas en canciones que NO sabia que exist&iacute;an, es impresionante la calidad.La camara es buena y el video es bueno. La multi tarea que manea el equipo es muy buena herramienta.Lo estoy disfrutando montones, era todo lo que esperaba y mas.
4	1301529600	Great technology for the price. Dislike the choice of materials for the back, the moment you take it out the box it will never look the same. Unless you purchase some plastic film. The camera is barely usable. I don't believe it has the IPS display because when you lay it flat the picture is not clear like the iPhone.
5	1301529600	This is the 1st time I have ordered electronics on line and it does match exactly what I ordered.  It is nice to have for downloading music and pictures.  Just have not figured out how to download anything that I have music wise on my computer already that I want to put on my IPOD. Instructions were not really clear how to do that.
5	1301356800	I bought the Ipod touch for my son for his birthday. It is very entertaining. He has enjoyed it thoroughly everyday since receiving it.
4	1301270400	Everything is great.  There is really nothing bad about it.  I did notice that the camera picture quality is not as great as my 3gs iphone. A bit surprised by that.
5	1301270400	Great product.  User friendly. This was bought for my 12 y.o. kids and they love it.  They love when wifi is available, it can be used like an ipad. Best gift!!  Keeps them entertained!!
5	1301270400	I can't believe I waited this long to purchas an Ipod.  This thing is awesome.  Very easy to use, and has all of the functions you could ever need and more.  It was so easy to use my 6 yr. old was able to figure everything out on it when I let him use in it in a long car ride.  Definitely buy this, I will not be going back to any other MP3 player.
5	1301270400	I found the ipod touch to be VERY entertaining! I never bothered thinking about purchasing an ipod touch before until I got to use my sister's. I enjoyed it so much that I bought myself and my husband one. I found it to be the cheapest from amazon so we purchased it through here. So far the only problem I see with the ipod touch is that I get these weird glitchy colored lines on my screen when it's charging from time to time. But that's about it. I want to buy another ipod with more gigs in the future. Love it!
2	1301270400	This is my second IPOD Touch.  I had no problem staying within 8 GB on the first (first generation) so when the battery went I upgraded to the fourth generation 8 GB.  When I got this home and started setting it up, I couldn't load all the music and pictures from the first onto this (much less the apps). It seems that the operating system (plus built in software) consumes a gigabyte more memory than the old one.  Add any pictures and videos you take with this and an 8GB version does not belong on the market.  The original IPOD Touch came in 8, 16 and 32 GB. This generation comes in 8, 32 and 64. I probably could live with 16, but 8 will be a serious problem.  There are lots of nice things to say about the hardware (the camera isn't great, but it is faster than most point and shoot cameras so it is a decent feature). I haven't had it long enough to rate many of the features like battery life (which I measure in how many months before it is tethered to a USB port, not how many hours between initial charges).Two software flaws have been carried through from the initial model.  First, there is the lack of support for flash videos in Safari.  Android has overcome this, why not Apple? Second, the inability to delete music on the IPOD (you can delete it from your home computer, not from the IPOD itself).  This last problem is going to have much more impact now that the operating system has grown.  Since it runs out of memory out of the box, if I take it on a trip and want to do take pictures, I am going to have to dump something.  1300 songs (forget about the 2000 they advertise) takes up the majority of the memory, so while I can make a few gig free by deleting apps (that can be reinstalled once I get home) most of the memory is not manageable remotely.  This would be trivial to add without any chance of violating copyrights (which seems to be Apple' big bugaboo with music) since you could still only add songs from home.You may well want a 4th generation Touch, but forget about this one.  Get the 32 for $79 more. Shame on Apple for putting this on the market.
4	1301270400	Works great!  Besides a small glitch where the first album in the photo gallery is unclickable behind the the screen title that says "Album", everything has worked great so far.  Volume buttons on the side are handy, no longer having to turn the iPod back on, and unlock it to change the volume of your music while on the go.
5	1301097600	This is the second IPOD Touch 4th generation that I have purchased from Amazon.com.  I love buying it from Amazon because it's cheaper than apple.com or than any other store that had a so called sale.  I get it within 2 days with my prime shipping membership and I also get amazaon gift cards as well.As for the product itself, my boys love it!  They use it every single day. There is so much to do on this product, so many programs to download and to have it all on the same item that plays all their favorite music makes it perfect.
5	1301011200	The iPod touch has come a long way since it's debut in September 2007. The New 4th Generation iPod Touch brings new features & specs making it differ from previous 2nd Generation and 3rd generation iPod Touches.-GameCenter:Social gaming platform for you to compete against friends in game achievements-FaceTime: Apple's New Videocalling Feature Found on the iPhone 4 comes to the iPod Touch 4-2 Cameras: 0.7 MP Rear Still Camera with HD Video Recording and 0.3 MP Front Camera with VGA Video-Thinner at 7.2 mm(2G/3G's were 8.3 mm)-Bigger Battery rated at 40 hours Music Playback or 7 hours Video Playback(30 music and 6 video on previous 2G/3G iPod Touch's)-Built-in Microphone-Better Speaker-Faster A4 Processor-Retina Display(Super high resolution display perfect for eReading and web browsing)When I first got the iPod in my hands, it felt incredibly thin. Except I soon learned this could be a bad thing for many reasons. One reason is that the back is made of Shiny Silver Chrome which looks nice at first but immediately starts collecting scratches and finger smudges as soon as you touch it or set it on something. Another reason that thinness is bad is that the iPod is very fragile, dropping it from say a 5 foot drop to the floor and you will have a broken iPod or cracked screen before you know it. So I seriously recommend getting a case, probably the Otterbox Defender Cases. They are around $25 on here, amazon. There are a bunch of cases that are cheaper but seriously don't just go get a cheapo silicone case that will collect dust and still scratch your iPod backing, resist the temptation to buy the #2.99 cases!-Email/Web BrowsingFor Email and web browsing, this little thing is awesome. You can hook up your email to the MAIL app that's included and be able to check your email with a breeze(with Wi-Fi of course). Web Browsing is also just as good. I like that I can open several tabs and can save some sites to the home screen so i have easier access to them.*One thing to note about email: Microsoft Hotmail/Live accounts do not work with the MAIL app, so you will have to go through safari web browser for that.-GamingThis player is great for games, but don't expect it to be a dedicated game player, with continous game play from full charge this iPod can probably last 2.5 hours. The Touchscreen is very powerhungry. But it's great to give to kids for little games and for the casual game user it's fine, but don't expect it to be a DS or something because it's not. If your serious about a game player, look elsewhere. Although unlike the expensive DS and PSP games,  I like that a lot of the gaming apps are only 0.99 cents with some being free!-MediaAt the heart of the iPod Touch is it's media playback of music and videos. Music Playback is pretty good and has good sound quality if you actually get a good pair of earbuds instead of the bad apple earphones. The speaker is louder and fuller that previous generations. You can also now Edit/Delete/Create Playlists on the go with the iPod Touch. Video playback is amazing, awesome for watching movies in the dark.-Size ChoiceMost people debate getting the 8GB or 32GB(or 64GB). Well what I can tell you is that I was wanting too get the 32GB but instead decided on the 8GB. On my 8GB iPod Touch, I can hold 2 Movies, 1 TV episode, 418 songs, and 52 apps and still have 1.4 GB left. But consider the 32GB if you want to hold A LOT of movies/videos all at once with you and a lot of music. I find I am perfectly able to get by with my 8GB*Note: About Capacity wise, with the operating system taking up some space on the models, the models actually have lower capacity than what they advertise.8GB=6.5GB32GB=29GB64GB=59GBPros:-Awesome Music Playback Battery Life-Retina Display(it is awesome!)-Cameras(Although they are bad quality when put on facebook or printed, etc, at least we have cameras)-Built-in Microphone-Ability to Edit/Delete/Create playlists on the go-eReading via Kindle APP or iBooks APPCons:-Extremely low resolution cameras(photos look when shown on iPod but look horrible when uploaded to facebook, twitter,etc.)-Shiny Chrome Back that scratches easily-Tied to iTunes
4	1300924800	This is a first impression review, only had the device for a few days but already knew quite a bit about it.  I do not buy any electronics without taking a lot of looking first.Pros: Great fun, speed, screen quality, appearance, touchscreen, application, reception, features, app store.  Check it out for yourself, and if you like it, give it a try, it will stick on you.  Can be used for just about everything. I use mine for the variety of helpful tools it provides in education as a student (at the moment).Cons:**all except the drop are easily fixable cons** One drop and your doomed (check ebay, you'll see what I mean). Back panel attracts scratches like a terrier to a rodent.  Basically requires you to buy at least one case.  Still uses old proprietary cord plug, even though the cord is clearly just a regular USB mated to the ipod plug. Cannot replace battery (safely) yourself. No expanded memory slot. No dust/debris cover for charge/sync port (even my aging v1 samsung intensity has that).The "slimdown" clearly affects the camera quality (the cameras they smashed in there somehow), although you don't need much more than 5mp for 99% of the pictures and movies most people take, they complain anyway.  I use an 8mp point and shoot (canon) and I could make posters with that quality.  Maybe they should add a nice camera, but be prepared to pay at least $300+ to make up the difference on the 8gb version.
5	1300924800	I got two of these iPod Touch for my two granddaughters (10 and 12 years old). They are so happy they just squealed and couldn't talk for a while (which is saying something!).If giving these as a present, I would recommend doing the initial setup and get a pre-paid Visa to start them out. It's a real bummer to have to wait for grandpa to figure out how to do all the preliminary stuff in the heat of the moment. They did come factory charged, so, the batteries were 'up' when the packaging came off. Throw a couple apps and tunes on there as well so they got something to work with.I also recommend getting a 'gel' cover for them to prevent scratches. I got some very nice colorful ones that also were a big hit.What they don't tell you is you need a computer that can support iTunes and that you need an iTunes account (which requires a charge or debit card). You also have to be pretty savvy about setting up WiFi access if you have that at home. It's pretty much like setting up a Wii's wireless except a little easier.Since I have an iPhone 4, I knew how to work these things and I had the foresight to bring a laptop to the party. We used my iPhone's personal hotspot function so they could do some things with WiFi as well. Once we got 'Angry Birds' on them, all was good!These little things are amazing like an iPhone without the phone. I am now the greatest grandpa ever!
3	1300924800	You need use itunes to transfer music, even cannot drag a directory into it because it's completelt not a USB flash drive for windows or mac.only several format supportted for video, play the others? free it.When you install some app from official Apple app store and don't tell itunes, it will try to uninstall them by itself!!! What's the...!!! There is even some confilcts inside Apple official tools?Frankly, I hate everything not open, but anyway, they build cool stuffs (at least most guys believe)So... even I hate it, I need to buy one for my wife."I said no, but my wife said yes."
5	1300838400	it's my 1st time buying goods in amazon!a terrific experience! perfect Itouch, lowest prize and fast delivery speed!i enjoyed it very much! i'll keep going in amazon! thank you!
5	1300838400	I bought two of this ipod for my young sisters as a gift! They love it! it has everything the iphone 4 has except for the mobile network. I am in fact going to buy myself another one :) I strongly recommend it if you want a small computer with you all the time.
5	1300752000	I have never owned anything made by Apple, but have always heard great things about their products.  I bought an iPad a few months ago and love it... I just received the new iPod touch, and love it just as much.  It does everything, and more.  I plan to utilize it primarily for music, pics, and films, and the occasional checking of my emails (when I don't have my iPad), and so far, it is everything I thought it would be.  I am sold on apple as a consumer, and can't wait to switch to everything Apple!
5	1300752000	I bought this as a christmas gift for my husband. I am not really into the apple craze but he is. This is his first itouch and I got the best price here. I researched everywhere and ppl were paying the same for refurbished ones.I actually regret buying it bc he loves it so much that he doesnt mind giving of the computer and is glued to angry birds as we speak. It's the first thing he plays with when he wakes up and falls asleep with it. he's 35 and addicted. Warning, this is a debilitating toy!I must say I am impressed though. kudos to apple
3	1300665600	i bought this item about 2 months ago....it work like an iphone 4g, except you can't talks....the performance is incredible...i love it..
5	1300665600	The New Apple Ipod gave more than I bargained for! For instnace, I purchased the Ipod for my wife because she loves several different types of music. After I gave it to her she was able to enjoy and download all types of music to her new personal Ipod Touch. Another feature that is great about the Ipod Touch is that it has the ability to go online and also allows the consuemr to download several cool apps.  I would recommend that each person should purchase a Ipod Touch if they prefer to experinece more than just listening to music. Another thing that I would like to add about the Ipod Touch is that it also has a camera, exterior speaker, and has the ability to allow movies to be watched. My last thought about this product is that it is a great gift as well as a great personal buy!
1	1300665600	first one broke and apple sent me a REFURBISHED replacement...replacement broke after 100 days and apple "customer service" wanted $129 to fix it...apple is designed to gouge people with faulty products and zero customer service
5	1300579200	Glad I purchased the IPOD.  It's fun - quick and easy to use.  The only downside is screen finger prints slow down games.  Women - make sure you don't have any hand lotion on - lolol.
1	1300579200	Would not work after a week.  Used only indoors and a temperature sceen appeared.  Will not work, battery low but will not charge.  Disappointed.  Make sure you back up your i tunes.  Had $40 worth of music on this one.
5	1300492800	I'm one of those people who have resisted Apple products.  I have another brand mp3 player and, in fact, I didn't really buy the iPod 4g for music as much as for internet access.  I've had it about a month now and use it constantly for accessing email and Facbook from anywhere in the house.  None of the current browsers seem to be really good for web browsing, but I've downloaded apps for nearly every place I want to visit online including Amazon, Barnes & Noble, QVC, HSN, Weather Channel, CNN, and more.  I've loaded pictures, videos, and music.  It's amazing to download a song from iTunes while lying in bed at night.  I can download my purchased ebooks onto the iPod as well.This iPod is extremely well made, the touch screen is amazing, and it just plain works as it should.  I have a netbook that I regret buying because the iPod does everything the netbook does in a much smaller package and does it better.It's one of those things that, once you get it, you wonder how you ever lived without it.  Many have criticized the battery life, but it seems fine to me.  Given the amount of time I use it, I only have to charge it every 3 or 4 days.  I took a couple of pictures just to test the camera.  I haven't used the video recorder yet, nor had a chance to try Facetime or Skype.It's agreat product and highly recommended.  Amazon's price is great too.
5	1300492800	Once you get to know the functions it easy to navigate and fun to use.Has  plenty of apps  to choose from and takes greatsvideo and audio.
5	1300492800	Needed for media purposes, couldn't keep using my BB Storm2 killing my battery life.Great device what else can I say video conference, great apps, better than retail price, etc. All in all I would definitely go through Amazon to make a major purchase such as this one again.
5	1300492800	I love the product but besides that the customer service Amazon provides.I had an exchange and credit and repurchase on an upgraded item, super quick no hassles.!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you Amazon
5	1300406400	Got this as a gift.  Have had it for awhile.  Hate giving reviews that are "too soon" so after having my iPod Touch for 90 days I have to say it's great.  I can see what all the fuss is about.  They make just about "iEverything" for this piece of technology.  An app for this, an app for that.  No technobabble from me, just if you have doubts about what this device can do...DON'T!  Get one.
5	1300406400	Had to call support once because it quit but the tech explained what to do and it should not happen again. It hasn't. I have enjoyed using it, especially with the scorecenter app and being able to check my email. The 8 gb capacity seems to be enough for my use.
5	1300406400	I really love my ipod. I can listen to it at work. I work 8-10 hours a day. The battery is fully charged and I do not need to recharge it while at work. Thanks so much!
2	1300320000	This is the first Apple product I have ever bought, and, so far, I'm not very impressed. I returned the first one I received because the earphones would not stay attached to the device. Amazon very quickly sent a replacement, but it has exactly the same problem! I even went to an Apple store to make sure it wasn't something I was doing wrong. It's really tiresome to have to return it again, and I'm not sure I'll request a replacement this time.
5	1300320000	This is great. It's expensive, but it's worth it for when you're bored. My only problem is that the wi-fi is messed up - my Mac can find wi-fi just fine!!! But its very sleek and pretty even when you have a case on it - which you need for a 200 dollar something product! Very nice capacity and cameras and the battery life is awesome, especially compared to the 3rd generation. Dual cameras = &lt;3
5	1300320000	Love to work 'brainteasers' and was thinking about a hand-held gamer design mainly for kids, but since I'm a grown-up I was looking for another alternative.  Found it in the ITouch and got so much more... I feel grown-up and I look `hip'. Think I just gave myself away... who uses the word `hip' anymore?
5	1300320000	My husband really love it that we are going to buy another one for my daughter.  Really fast service too.
3	1300233600	It's ok~but doesn't hold a charge well, which is a problem.  I wish I'd spent the money on an ipod~much better value for the money.  I'll give this to one of my grandchildren.  If you want much more than games and a camera, don't buy this.
5	1300147200	I bought this 4th gen IPOD for my girlfriends daughter and she loves it. I ordered the 3rd gen a year ago for my son and was really pleased with that one until I got this one it is awesome and she couldn't be happier...
4	1300060800	This is a very good iPod. It's pretty reasonably priced for all it can do. The only thing is the camera. If you're looking for this to be the camera you use all the time, then don't get it. Other than that, it's an excellent iPod.
5	1300060800	This is a must buy item. Great price battery life is good and screen is awesome. highly responsive and there are TONS of free and paid apps. I think 34,500. If you want to have a fun and awesome time ( even if your bored :) )this is the think to buy.
5	1299974400	This was a 19 year old's requested birthday gift and she loves it. The only drawback that I have seen is the quality of the pictures is not good when transferred to the computer but left on the IPod they are fine. She is thrilled.
3	1299974400	Fun little item, however I find the battery life to be a problem.  I find that I have to recharge after about 2 hours of use.  I do not own a portable charger and have to hook it up to my computer, which isn't always accessible.
5	1299974400	Apple has done it again. Bought this IPod for my wife so that we could Facetime and so that she could play games and surf the web like I can with my IPhone. She loves it.
5	1299888000	This was my first ipod touch,I got the 32gig,but before this my old ipod video fell in the toilet,so i replaced the hardrive but the ipod kept randomly turning off. so i got this,and i must say its freakin amazing, the a4 chip makes it fast atleast compared to the older ipods i have used, i really couldn't say much about the retina display since i can't really compare it. the camera is like a .9 mp,pictures are pretty good and video is great also.i thought overall being my first ipod touch it was good, there are plenty of apps (although at the moment i have trouble finding apps i want) ranging from school, to books, to games, to dictionarys. all great! videos on youtube load very fast opposed to my pc.the volume buttons are different(seperate) and theres now a speaker. the speaker is good but its not like a boombox so only use it in a moderatly quiet room. the screen needs a prtector, my screen gets to smudgy if i don't have one on. also youll want a decent case for the time being,i have a thin 10$ belkin case at the moment, i plan on getting the kind that has 2 layers and are bulky.over all this mp4 is a great buy.
5	1299801600	I like this product. I only use it to call friends because I installed SKYPE on it, I used it to read iBooks, and take pictures.  I am still learning the other APS.
2	1299801600	Disclaimer: I run Linux. I cannot use iTunes with my OS. Stanza/Calibre did not support synching at the time and worked poorly once it did.I managed to score an iPod Touch for a reasonable price. It was a package deal and came with a silicon cover to protect from scratches and smudges, which was great, because that shiny shiny case smudges if you so much as look at it wrong and is a bugger to clean without scratching. Super excited, I took it home, unboxed it, charged it, turned it on, made all my settings changes, went to the App Store and downloaded a free e-book reader so I could load my e-books onto my handy dandy little portable "everything" device.Went to my desktop and what the heck do you mean, it's not mounted?! Googled and .. what the heck do you mean, you can't mount it as a device?! The ONLY way to get information onto the iPod Touch was via wireless. There's no USB transfer protocol at all. Ok, fine, I tried to log into my wireless network - I am running 802.11/n. The iPod Touch wouldn't work with my encryption level. I went into my wireless router and lowered the encryption level. Still no go. Eventually had to turn encryption off entirely to load my books, music, and video. It doesn't keep non-iTunes metadata tags, so most of my items didn't have names and I had to manually go in and re-tag everything with their touchscreen keyboard. It took far too long and by the end I was ready to throw the thing out the window. Determined, I persevered.The first time I used it, I discovered another issue - I can't use my own headphones. The jack is 3.5mm but is recessed to the point where you pretty much have to use Apple-branded headphones or else. The iPod headphone cord wasn't long enough to comfortably fit in my coat pocket and my ears at the same time and kept pulling out of the device. Replacements that would fit the iPod were outrageously priced.The iPod worked great for about two weeks. Then there was a firmware update. It crashed on reboot. I wound up with the dreaded blinky apple of doom. Google told me This Was Bad. I tried to hard reset. Didn't work, came back up with blinky apple. Panicked, I started pushing buttons. I rebooted it, I held buttons down, I held combinations of buttons down, and eventually it booted. All my data was there, and all the tags had been removed, so I had to go in and manually re-tag everything again. Six hours later, it crashed again for no good reason. This time, it took my data with it. It erased my apps as well, even though my settings hadn't been touched. I did a factory reset and then let it update, on the off chance my settings changes had messed it up the first time. That worked, so I disabled my wireless router's encryption and loaded all my data again. Thankfully, the App Store kept records of my purchases and let me download them again without charges. Everything was, of course, untagged again. Manually re-tagged everything.Worked fine for another month or so, and this time when it decided to spaz out, it didn't crash, it just messed up all my data, untagged everything, and either deleted several books or moved them into a folder I couldn't find. I was on a road trip and did not have a laptop with me. Desperate, I stopped at a Starbucks and tried to use their wireless but ran into yet another problem - it would connect for about 5 seconds, then the connection would time out. Not long enough for me to download anything. Other people had no issues with the connection in the S'Bux. My rage at this point was nearing apoplectic levels and it was very difficult not to find a rock and smash the device into pieces simply for the catharsis value. I bought the thing specifically so I would have something to listen to music and read books on during travel. When I got home, it went into a drawer.Months later, I took it to the Apple Store in a final bid to keep it, figuring it had to be me. I was doing something wrong. It couldn't be that it was just a complete piece of crap with horrible proprietary software functionality. Everyone loves them! It had to be me! The "Genius" took one glance at my iPod Touch only to tell me he couldn't help me, I'd gotten the device wet. The "moisture sensor" was triggered so even though it was under warranty, I'd just have to buy a new one. WHAT?! It hadn't gone near liquid! I didn't even wear it when I was sweaty or anything! Oh and it was encased in a silicon cover the entire time! I'd cleaned the finger-smudged screen once with a chamois barely dampened with an alcohol-based cleaning solution. The "Genius" said that was probably what triggered the "moisture sensor". I fought with them on the issue and eventually they upgraded me to the manager who finally agreed to see what they could do for it for a small surcharge. All they did was reset it to factory specs, which erased my data AGAIN, charged me for doing something I could and already had done myself, and sent me home. This time, the iPod went to live in its box by itself to think about what it'd done.I am selling my iPod Touch to someone who's willing to put up with all this garbage just to have an iPod Touch. I will never buy another one. I will do my darnedest to keep anyone I know from buying one as well after all the hassle mine caused me. The lack of USB transfer protocol and mounting capability is a dealbreaker for me. The lack of this on Apple devices has turned me off of them entirely.Pros: It's pretty and all your friends will envy you. Unless they have one, in which case, they will share commiserating smirks. When it works, it's a slick device and the touch screen is responsive and mostly accurate.Cons: It goes down harder and more often than a Hollywood starlet. Which is an insult to Hollywood starlets - some of them turn into productive members of society and my iPod Touch was anything but productive. You can't use non-Apple headphones with it successfully. You can't mount it as a device, so there's no good way to back up your data without "synching" to something like Calibre or iTunes. The chassis will smudge at the slightest provocation if you don't have a cover and you don't dare clean it with anything liquid or the sensor inside will trigger and gods help you then if you have to get it repaired because they'll say "you got it wet". You will spend more time on Google trying to figure out why the heck it's not working THIS time than you will spend enjoying your music or videos or books on it.I bought a smartphone that runs Android. It can do everything the iPod Touch can and it has USB mounting protocol so I can easily drag and drop items to the device's SD card and could easily replace data if it were to crash - which it hasn't in the time I've owned it. Apple lost a customer with the garbage that was the iPod Touch.
3	1299801600	Got the problem from the beginning... First boot and I realized that "Home" button is not working correctly. It`s a shame that Apple doesn`t even test there products before selling. I don`t have an apportunity to replace the device, so now I have to pay for fixing it... Too bad.I thought that Apple is a model for other manufacturers... Unfortunatly, I changed my mind after this purchase...
4	1299715200	the product is excellent, froze once, came back on later, did not like how it arrived by a postal worker instead of ups or fed-ex the box was slightly smashed and anyone could have opened it and taken it? thumbs down on that???
5	1299715200	Okay, so the reason I've given this product 5 stars is because of a few things. This is why I love my ipod Touch, and reccommend it to anyone who (like me) want something that:1. Can play music and entertain you at the same time2. Doesn't mind buying apps from the app store.3. Likes to buy game apps for mindless entertainment during long bus rides, subway trips, or airplane rides.4. Appreciates the times that you do find a free wireless connection (which has been far too few for me!)I wouldn't reccomend it for someone who wants it for:1. A constant internet connection. (Wireless is useless unless you live near a college campus or plenty of Starbucks)2. Only for Music (Ipod touch has so many applications, games, cameras, pedometers, exercise apps, more that you should take advantage of)Now, I bought the 8 GB version, and it is perfect for me. I don't have a huge Music library. Probably only around 3-4 GB's of it, and the 4 remaining GB's of space are more than enough for me to use for Games, Videos, or Photos.BUT if you have a huge library, and want to not worry about space for downloading apps, the upgrade to 32 would be worth it.Oh, and strongly reccomend buying a case to keep your ipod touch nice and pretty :)
2	1299628800	I bought this product in January and it was pretty awesome. It did everything it says it does and did it well. It's now the beginning of March and the ipod fell out of the case I had it in and the screen SHATTERED!! If that's not bad enough the warranty DOES NOT cover external damages. That's right, if your ipod screen cracks you're out of luck. Apple will charge you about what you originally paid to replace the screen.As much as I loved my ipod paying over two hundred dollars for something I could only use for two months and then can't get repaired sucks. It would be one thing if I abused my ipod but I was careful, I kept it in a case at all times. Not worth the money and not worth the hassle.
5	1299628800	Wonderful.  I'm not a techy, but I can't believe I lived without it for so long.  Podcasts are a great discovery.
4	1299542400	I love my iPod Touch! My only complaint is that the battery doesn't last as long as advertised. Is it because the time passes so quickly when I'm using it, or is it because some of the apps take up more battery power than others? I'm not sure, but I know I have to charge the iPod once or twice a day.
5	1299542400	Wish there was a flash on the camera, but otherwise it is AWESOME!  My husband has an older version which does not have the dual camera, so he is a bit jealous.  ;-)  Great iPod.  I didn't think I needed a "touch", after all I have a nano...but I am glad I spent the money for this...
3	1299542400	ok, I'm an older reviewer- can't stand to see kids walking around, with their heads down, looking at the handheld things in their hands.I swear it calls to them- touch me! use me! play with me!I'm not jealous, the screen is too small for me to see very well!  and the finger prints on the screen drive me nuts!but the kids love it, and there are pretty neat things (apps) you can do on it- love the high pitched noise that adults can't hear!and I'd rather spend that much money on something else, but overall- it's a decent little 'thing'.
4	1299456000	amazon is my favorite online shop....always fast ship and great product...this item is everybody must have...it has so much things u can do with...
5	1299456000	I've owned every iPod Touch model and it never fails, I am always impressed. So when I found out that the newest model had a camera, I had to have it! This new version also includes retina display, so the screen overall is just perfect. It it smaller than all of the other models, and thinner. The battery life is OK. What I really want to talk about is the cameras. The iPod touch comes with HD video recording, which is awesome for a device like an iPod, but we saw it coming. Now the actual camera to take pictures is not so great, especially in low light. When it's bright outside, the picture is still a little grainy, but obviously much better than when in low light conditions. Speaking of cameras, FaceTime is now available to video chat with people who have the iPad 2, a Mac computer, an iPhone, or another iPod touch. It's very neat, and I've used it to video chat with a friend in Washington, DC. There were no call interruptions and everything went very smoothly. I'm very impressed with the 4th generation iPod touch. Nothing can compare.
5	1299456000	This is the best thing since the 8- track player back in the 70's! I wish we had things like this back then! I'm 52 years old but , I like my music when I work and when I'm walking outside! Everything about this player in great! It is so easy to download music! I like all kinds of music! It's like having a old jukebox in the palm of you hand!!!
5	1299456000	My 10 year old saved up all her money and bought an iTouch.  Of course she LOVES it.  Now everyone in the family has either an iPhone or iTouch.  We love Apple!
5	1299369600	My step-up from the 2nd generation to the 4th was a good investment.  I love having the built in camera and video capabilities. I was pleasantly surprised how clear the pictures are and the voice quality on the videos is great as well.  I would recommend this product to both young and older individuals,it is easy to operate and allows you to manage your daily calendar with a touch of the finger.
5	1299369600	My iPod touch is my new favorite electronic device. It isn't too big, can surf the web with wireless access, plays videos and stores many songs, podcasts, streams radio. Aside of music, my favorite use is for radio--I downloaded a couple of free Apps to stream my favorite stations--no more static!! Battery life average if playing music, drains a little faster with videos.  I usually charge once a day since I leave my radio player on for a few hrs. at night.  It has a lock passcode in case you lose it--no one can hack your information. I am fine with the 8GB-seems to be adequate for someone who loads a little of everything on their iPod.
5	1299369600	The Apple Ipod Touch 4th generation is exactly the gift that me recipient wanted.  He is pleased that is the product he expected it to be. All apects of its operation are more than satisfactory.I thought it a little pricey, because no doubt soon (with the next generation of ipod touch) the price will go way down.
5	1299283200	I am happy with the product. It replaced a 16G 3rd generation iPod. I am happy with the addition of the camera. Surprised it it smaller and does not fit in any of the assesories I have for my old iPod.
5	1299196800	My wife and I chose this for our daughters 8 birthday. I was a little unsure if this would be a good gift for someone turning 8 but this is the technology age... Bottom line... SHE LOVES IT!!! She is enjoying many aspects of it such as: the timer (to time her at home reading minutes), all the free apps you can download (their are so many educational apps out there) and probably best of all is the camera. She is taking pics and movies of just about anything and everything. We've got her wireless internet connection disconnected and only enable it when we want to download a new app or let her listen to streaming (free) music on Pandora. If you have a kid that begs to play with your iPhone, get them this and they'll leave you alone. best part is, you don't have a monthly phone bill. =) ***** I give this item 5 stars for sure! *****
5	1299110400	I think that the ipod touch 4th generation 8gb is the best mp4 player in the world!!! i would give it 10 stars if i could!!! i used to have a 2nd generation, but decided to upgrade, turns out i made the PERFECT  choice.pros: it is thinner and lighter than before, it's WAY faster, the video quality is execptional, and it's multitasking is awesome!!cons: the camera is 1megapixels at best, the video camera works well and has pretty good quality.
5	1299110400	The new 4th generation is slimmer and lighter but with even more capability. The face-time feature is fantastic. Video quality is better than I expected for being so new. Definitely worth buying!
5	1299110400	I got this iPod touch for my mom. She is over 60 and does not like to learn how to use a PC. However, I wanted her to use Skype and Facetime to communicate with me, as I live in a different country and communication can get costly fast.Getting an iPod touch was the best and easiest option after all. It took my mom not longer than an hour to learn how to operate it, use all the Apps (I only installed a few apps for her). And the quality of video calls over Facetime is great!
4	1299024000	I am sad that I have to purchase Microsoft outlook in order to transfer data from my pc to the iPod touch.  This makes the cost more than I anticipated--I was able to use my microsoft contact to transfer my contacts.
5	1299024000	I thought long and hard before buying this Ipod and I am so glad I did. It has been a great investment.
5	1298937600	If you are on the fence about one of these, don't be. It's a seriously amazing little device and it's one of the few things out there that lives up to everything it's hyped up to be. So Amazing.
5	1298851200	Absolutely wonderful. I love the camera the iPod Touch comes with now, and the resolution is really good. Great size, very portable, slips in and out of my pocket easily, neat little device for my music.
4	1298678400	This is a great multimedia kit, light, fast, clear, but I would have expected the battery to last a bit longer. Another slight problem is the earpieces, a bit too big for my ears. This said, I love it.
5	1298505600	I am not an Apple person but got the iPod Touch 8GB model as a gift. At first I didn't bother with it, then I started buying music from iTunes...then I started downloading podcasts...then I started streaming movies and television shows with my Netflix membership...and now I am in love with this handy little device. I can listen to music, watch movies and quickly browse the web or check email on my Android phone, but the battery saps instantly. The iPod battery life is incredible by comparison. I never thought a gadget that does not make phone calls could be so darned useful. Only problem is that I am already close to filling up the 8GB with all my music, podcasts, etc. I would buy higher capacity but did not have a choice since it was a present.
5	1298505600	I absolutely love my iPod.  I got the 8 GB model as an entry into Apple, having never had one before and after a week, I wished I had splurged and got a larger GB model. Just a couple of complaints, the speaker volume on the 4th G model is actual lower than the speaker on the previous model. I like to listen to audiobooks and have had to plug in an external speaker to use when I am walking around.  I've tried bluetooth headsets but they are hit or miss with this. Not sure if it is the headset or the iPod. Lastly, I hate iTunes. If I could use my iPod with my Zune software, it would be perfect but that would be against the laws of nature. Overall, it was a good foray into Apple-dom and has convinced me to get an iPhone when my contract expires later this year.
2	1298419200	well I'm not to happy with this product when I purchased it, it seemed OK, but later we noticed that the touch screen face was loose and its been a real pain. I have no idea where to take it to get fixed.  I really wished I would have just bought it brand new. Only unhappy because it was used and doesn't seem like new like the ad said. So FYI buy NEW! and you will get brand NEW stuff that only you can blame yourself if it messes up. And I payed alot for it to be messed up is a bummer. Good-luck and remember buy NEW!!!!!!!!!!
1	1298419200	Do not buy anthing from onSale.They're gonna hold your money for 5 days and cancel your order without any reaction.There are so many good business men except onSale.It's serious. Check about onSale in Amazon.It's true.
4	1298332800	I am a first time owner of any Apple product and this Ipod Touch 8GB has impressed me greatly. I was disappointed at first to hear that the resolution was not HD, as in at least 720P. However after getting it I understood what the Retina display is all about. Soon after getting it I was watching an episode of Arrested Development in amazing quality. Apparently the pixels are so small our eyes cannot tell the difference from one to the other which makes this possible.BENEFITSMusic:You can view your music by genre which is sortof like a random playlist which is sometimes useful. The quality is as you would expect, it's pretty decent and will depend on your delivery system, have cheap earbuds, get a cheap sound; have an ihome speaker or quality buds, you'll get quality sound.Applications:This device would be practically useless to me at this price if 3rd party application were unavailable, as in Microsoft's dead Zune line.I cannot speak highly enough of being able to install every IM client that I have available and have that available wherever I have wifi.The Mail client built in is working for me so far. I have installed a gmail account as well as set up a POP on my own domain and it works flawlessly.Youtube is too slow in my experience, but I'm hoping there is another program out there that will connect better than the built in client.The Kindle application is great, I appreciate the side scrolling instead of down, it's easier on the eyes.Camera:- The MP quality was not listed when I purchased this and I realize now why, it is somewhere around 0.7MP. I took several shots and aside from purchasing a tripod and testing that all pictures are virtually unuseable. They are blurry and don't look good.Video - Video quality is decent, it isn't going to blow you away but this is where we are at technologically. You can't expect the quality of blu-ray movies shot with $1000s of dollars of filming for $200 for something that it wasn't really designed for in mind. I am now grateful that it is simply built in.As long as your videos are to remain on a small screen they should be good enough for all intensive purposes.Operating System:I am running OS 4.2.1 which allows for seamless multitasking as well as creation of folders in the ipod. Both features I have discovered work very well, it would be nice to change folder icons but this is Apple we're talking about.NEGATIVES:Operating System:Apple designed this to be a closed system. It is a mini computer, but that is not what they want YOU to view it as. Thus any applications installed MUST be purchased/downloaded from their App store. This stymies growth of the system as well as innovation.WORKAROUND: It is legal to jailbreak your ipod. Many people around the world devote their time to create workarounds for each new OS version on this line of products giving you "fair use" access to the root which allows you to install your own applications.Camera - see above.Battery life:You will have to charge on a daily basis, I've spent hours on the thing every day and it does drain. Not a problem if you have access to charging every day though, but if you will be gone several hours just take your charger with you. This limits the portability of a pocket device, I hope in the future they put in a better battery.HUGE NEGATIVE:Hard Drive:8GB is way to small. Take it from me who's had it a week and installed about 5GB of music(about 16 soundtracks, barely anything), and a gig and half for applications. The Hard drive space doesn't cut it at all, I am trying to sell my ipod now and will upgrade to one with more space.POTENTIAL NEGATIVES:Voice Calls - Some people would like an Ipod to be just like an Iphone.WORKAROUND - With a wifi connection you can install a VOIP client to make calls through your wifi. Some other services such as google voice allow you to send text messages free of charge. Just get that set up and make incoming and outgoing calls thanks to the speaker and mic. Literally just flip your ipod upside so your talking to the backside and it's just like a phone, but at a fraction of the price. I am now paying less than $5 per month for unlimited calls and texting. The only drawback to this is you can only do this where you have wifi, for some this is not a problem for others here is your workaround. Get a mifi, it is about the size of a cell phone but instead of making calls it takes a cellular 3g and turns it into portable wifi. You can get a plan from VZ for only $35 a month, I will be waiting till VZs 4G mifi device comes out sometime 1st quarter 2011.Ergonomics - The downsliding curved back makes it so that it rests in the hand easier, BUT it makes adjusting the volume on the device impossible without using both hands in a strange fashion. That needs to be addressed in future versions. *EDIT* I realized this was because I am Left-handed. I hope in the future like the Kindle they put the buttons on both sides.All in all the 4th Generation Ipod Touch is well worth the money but do not waste your time with the 8GB model, if you can afford the $208 for the 8GB version, just save up to the $270 for the 32GB version.
5	1298332800	so far i love everything about this ipod. has been couple of months since i bought it, and have used it for almost everything it has to offer me. and i am very satistfied with it. and also like the way amazon.com worked out for me to get this ipod. so far absolutely love it.
5	1298332800	My daughter wanted an MP3 player.  A friend recommended this thing instead.  This was a Christmas gift and has been used daily.  I have not seen my daughter use it for the music or movies yet.  This was a good purchace and I have no regrets.
1	1298246400	Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She was at Starbucks yesterday with her mom, and it got knocked off the table.  It hit the floor, and the screen shattered even though I had also bought a case for it.  While the Touch is definitely a cool product with some great features, it is simply too fragile for kids to use.  I'll be sticking with Nintendo products from now on.  You can drop them multiple times with no damage.  Also, called Apple to find out if it was covered by warranty.  It was not, and it would cost $99 to fix it plus $6 shipping and handling.  Can't justify spending that much to fix it when it would likely just get broken again.
5	1298246400	Item received on time, and in perfect condition. Had one minor issue, and Technical Service provided excellent support, back on line in minutes.
5	1298160000	My first Apple product, and it is outstanding! Who needs a smart phone when you can get the IPod Touch 4G????? The graphics are amazing, and it's great to read on. Have downloaded several books, and it's so easy on your eyes with the back lighting!
5	1298160000	Amazing product.App store: Great. There's an app. for everything.Skype video Conferencing. WOW!Podcasts are so useful.
5	1298160000	The thing is it is very durable we got scared and i droped my ipod touch 4g and my brother droped his ipod touch 3g and his shattered in one spot and mine is still perfect.factime is wonderfull but the microphone will catch the littlest of sounds so be in a quiet placethe sound quuality is better than older ipod touches because the little speaker next to the usb wire plugbut the screen quality is bad with screen protectors and perfect without screen protector
5	1298160000	This is a great product but at the age of 81 I found that I did not have the coordination to press the right buttons at the right time.  For us older folks, it would be better to go to an I-Pad or a laptop computer--unless you can still thread a needle at 10 paces. Reluctantly, I had to return the I-Pod to Amazon for a refund.  Live and learn!
5	1298073600	great product by apple and fast free delivery by amazon! facetime and built in microphone are awesome additions. ooma mobile download application is a plus!
5	1297900800	I was given the IPod as a gift after begging for one. I guess my family thought that I would not rally use it. After all, what does a 63 year old Grandma need with an Ipod! Well. let me tell you I have had a blast with it. It is very intuitive and so easy to use that even a granny can have fun. And I am...
5	1297900800	I bought this as an anniversary gift for my boyfriend.He's a grad student and need to work in a very isolated lab alone. So I'm hoping this itouch could be a good company and help him kill time.It worked out perfectly for him and his other 2 labmates also bought itouch recently after seeing him using it.He's very proud of that :-)The only thing I regret is I wish I had bought him a 16G/32G one. Isn't 8GB too small?
5	1297900800	The real reason I went for this product was to experience how iPhone works since everybody talks about this is like an iPhone 4 without a contract, except of course for the camera and memory and some other things. So far I find it very entertaining.
4	1297900800	A nice addition to my iPad. Generally it is a very nice unit, with only a couple of disappointments.First of all the resolution and response times are excellent. Being able to expand pages and fonts makes reading a pleasure for these 62 y.o. eyes.The camera quality seem very grainy so are not up to the standard of quality I would expect from Apple.Also noted that there is only 6.5 GB of memory available which is pretty minimal. Too bad Apple didn't offer a 16 GB model as that would have been perfect for me.Since this unit has a microphone, it is feasible to make VOIP calls over wifi through Google Voice, Skype, as well as FaceTime.I look forward to enjoying this little marvel of technology for a long time. Amazing how thin it is. It's actually smaller than my cell phone.
5	1297814400	I primarily bought my iPod Touch as a mobile learning device. It allows me to read eBooks, listen to audiobooks and podcasts, as well as view lectures and movies, anywhere and everywhere I go. When I'm waiting at the doctor's office or getting my oil changed, I can just pull out my iPod and read, listen or watch. You might think the iPod screen is too small for reading eBooks, but I recommended you take one for a test drive at your local store. The retina display makes the text so easy to read. You can also configure the text size, font, and layout just the way you want. I've read several books with no complaints at all. And just try slipping a Kindle or Nook into your pocket like you can with the iPod. The iPod's interface is brilliantly intuitive, and the many apps available for viewing/listening to/viewing content make downloading content a snap. I purchased the 8GB version, since I don't need to carry dozens of movies at a time. With all of the books and podcasts I've downloaded, I still have plenty of room. When I run out, I'll just remove the ones I no longer need to make space for more. I've had no problems at all with the device in the month I've had it. I am completely satisfied with this purchase.
4	1297814400	the thing that is the most amazing about this product is that you can buy it for any age group there are a variety of different aps in the apple ap store for every day purpose. Also if you're kids desperately want a Phone and you aren't very sure if they would take care of it very well you can buy this for them as a test. The only complaints i have about this item is that the battery doesn't last very long it probably lasts about a day at the most. Also the speaker isn't very loud. But it is very good quality i haven't had any problems with cracking the screen or anything it is very durable. over all this item is worth every penny you spend on it
5	1297814400	I purchased this for a gift this past Christmas.  It has NOT been put down.  The games, apps, abilities to play music and interact with others is endless.  I haven't ever purchased a product that has been SO much fun~  Pricy?  Yes.  Would I do it again?  In a heartbeat.  :)My only complaint would be for Amazon themselves... went through the entire process of purchasing 2 of these, and Amazon would only let me buy one, so I was stuck scrambling around for a second one right before Christmas.  Thank God for Best Buy!  Ugh~ Amazon needs to warn people BEFORE they try to purchase something, that you are only allowed to buy ONE.
5	1297728000	Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela...
5	1297728000	Did not expect any less from this product.  Apple is not my favorite, but what they make (even if its over priced) does work.  You don't need a degree in computer science to have it perform the functions.My only CON is you have to do everything the Apple way.  iTunes years ago was a terror, at least they have improved the product to be ALMOST usable.  Converting data and importing it into the Touch is another story.  Good luck trying to not reenter your calendars or contact list.  I use Mozilla based applications, they work well and are FREE.  Getting data from them to iTunes is a real challenge.  Its the Apple way or the highway.  With the latest version of the OS, Apple took away the only useful app for importing data (mount as storage).  No sense complaining, Apple builds a good product for the non technical.
5	1297641600	I love my IPOD nano so I expected to love my IPOD Touch - - after two weeks my mail feature stopped working - I was surprised and unhappy - I called Amazon and within minutes my Customer Service Representative told me they would send me a new one immediately - - - their service is amazing - I now am buying more items from Amazon because of their response to my problem.
5	1297641600	Wonderful item,I have enjoyed every moment.No complaints at all.Its everything I need in such a small package and very affordable.I have never been able to own a cool electronic product,but now I feel I have the best. Its great for every age group,young and old.
1	1297641600	Ordered the Ipod item, waited 10 days to get it, and guess what? out of stock. After 10 days? Great customer.........service.......... Be aware, there are vendors that will screw you..... seriously....
4	1297641600	Very good product with many applications.  Am enjoying it greatly.  I find it easier to use when reading books that other forms of ebook readers due to its light weight.
5	1297641600	hey thane for the iPod I got it early and it works great guys thanks  alotif I need any other electronics I'm coming to u guys first thanks  again
3	1297555200	Okay, so this is my fourth ipod, and I had a Mac when they were called a "Macintosh".  I've been exclusively using Macs for about 15 years, but that's because I'm in "the arts" and it was the computer made for us (not so much anymore).  Here are some things to keep in mind when buying iPods:1) You can only use it on ONE of your Mac computers. I don't know about PC's, BUT even if you have all your Macs registered in your name, and your address, with your same credit card, and with Apple Care, you can still only connect your iPod to ONE of them. Choose wisely.2) Amazon is WAY cheaper than the iTunes store. Save yourself a TON of money and BUY HERE AT AMAZON!! It's just as easy as the iTunes store too. Maybe even easier, because they're not trying to cram the latest Lady GaGa gag-me song or whomever down your throat.3) When you download an MP3 to your computer, don't expect to have it on your next computer or your next. You MAY never be able to access it again once you change Macs UNLESS you take several steps to insure your transfer (that I have yet to figure out properly). I know you can hook up your new Mac to your old Mac and transfer certain things, but I really don't like cluttering up my new system with all the crap I'm trying to get rid of on the old one. Plus the OS is usually several versions newer.  The iTunes store seems to "keep" your purchases, but since I can't even plug my iPod into my laptop without doing a "restore", I'm not sure how this is supposed to work. I'm probably missing something simple, but I don't want to jump through fifty hoops to listen to a song I bought five years ago.  Some songs I bought from iTunes on my Mac (under the SAME EXCACT ACCOUNT), are now suddenly no longer able to transfer to my new iPod (yet, will still go on my older one). I have no idea why.4) If you want to insure you keep your music collection for YEARS to come, buy the CD, then load it onto your Mac.  I have bought the same digital albums multiple times because of buying new computers and ipods. I've gotten so sick of loosing songs, I've gone back to the old school. Plus, why pay the same for less? You don't get the CD that you can take anywhere. You don't get the artwork or any of the "extras".  You don't get the track information (i.e. who played what instrument on which track, or who sung which vocals). Those things are rather important when you're talking about a band say like the Beatles, who were always using different instruments, and switching vocalists. Without the physical CD and the information contained within, you'll have no idea how awesome your music actually is.5) People with PC's don't seem to have these problems as much, but I don't really know because I have three Macs with three different song libraries.  I'm getting pretty sick of how grabby and greedy Apple has become.6) I am NOT a computer or electronics expert in any way. I'm just an artist who works on Macs. So if anyone can tell me how to get my iPod hooked up to my other Macs, without having to erase all the previous data, and replace it with the other Mac's data, do let me know. I have about 200 songs I'd love to hear again.
3	1297555200	this product it ok, but the only thing that I did not like at all is the camara, pictures and video if you want to take a picture in low light the camara does not have flash so it'll come out really dark and the video camara you can't zoom in that really socks I kind of like everyting else but the only thing that I hate the most is the camara.
5	1297555200	Great product, great apps, fast shipping.  If you do not watch movies on your ipod this 8gb one will do just fine.
4	1297468800	Lots of fun but spring for the 64GB, One movie and 1/2 of my memory gone! Have to charge the battery everyday because using apps and playing games drains the battery fast! Sound over car radio is great and over earphones but without earphones is not so loud. apps are great but like I said, fast drain of the battery. Other than that, I love it, saves my life when my phone broke and couldnt check my e-mail.oh and I dont know if it is my router but if I am more than 10 feet away from my wireless router Ipod doesnt catch as well, even though laptop can catch?
4	1297468800	My first experience with Apple. Not good. Over $200 and no manual. Just a useless starter guide. I downloaded the manual from Apple and it is a joke. I wanted to set up my email on it and the manual said yes you can set up your email on it. That is the instructions on how to do it zilch. I finally found a web site that went through the ipod 4g step by step on all it's functions. Apple's manual is useless at best a joke at worst. This is the url of the web site that really explains the ipod 4g  [...] Yes it is an apple website but; I had to find it on my own no help from apple.The quality of the ipod 4g is very good. Everything works and the touch screen is very responsive. Another thing that it has is voice control. I never saw one word about this in the manual not even how to get to it. I like the ipod but because of the lack of documentation I would NEVER buy an Apple computer.
5	1297468800	I ordered this for the apps so they would give me a way to pass the time while im at work and it was money well spent. The sound quality and picture quality are great as well.
5	1297382400	I bought this for my mom for christmas, and she loves it! it's not too "techy" for her and it's OS is easy to navigate, I was even surprised with it's easy navigation. The battery life is really surprising aswell, I was getting an easy 24 hours or more out of each charge, so this is great for a roadtrip, flights or any long waiting periods. Unfortunately it doesn't have any 3G/4G connectivity, though it's WiFi support is more than enough for around home use.My only dislike it how quickly the green get's smudgy, and unles you want to clean it every few minutes I suggest picking yourself up a screen protector.
5	1297382400	I love the camera feature. Now you do not need 5 devices to do the same task. The FaceTime app is great also. You can talk to anyone, face to face.I use mine all the time and love it!!!!
5	1297382400	Love this thing, got it for my daughter, she loves it!  I have an Iphone4, its really the same thing without the phone feature.
5	1297296000	I ordered this for my daughter's 15th birthday present.  She loves it.  She can text with it just like a phone as long as he has wireless service.  The sound quality is pretty impressive for such a small device.  She is very careful with it as I have told her about other reviews stating that it is somewhat fragile if dropped.  We have the rubber cover on it with a screen protector.  I did order the otter cover and we are waiting for it to arrive.  The battery will run down fairly fast if it is being used for certain games or if it is searching for a wireless connection constantly, other than that it lasts a very reasonable amount of time.  A good purchase.
5	1297296000	Love my ipod touch. i have had it for less than 24 hrs, and already dont think i could get along without it! I can do everything on it but make my morning coffee! still getting used to the keypad, and not real impressed with the camera, but this is the best thing i have ever bought, boughtit mainly to have something to do while my husband is in the hospital, but it never leaves my side. I have already watched movies and talked to friends. who needs a cell phone when you have this!!!! Amazon was perfect to order from, i ordered my ipod at 6pm on tues night and got it befor 1pm on wed afternoon! everything is perfect!
5	1297296000	This device is fast, feature-rich, clear, and incredibly thin. It is easy reading ebooks -- I have put all my Kindle books on it, no extra charge. Apps work great: sketching with Sketchbook Mobile (virtually instant response), watching Netflix or PBS shows, no hitches in the streaming, even making music (if my efforts can be called music) with a keyboard app. I sync calendar and contacts with MS Office Outlook, and songs and photos with iTunes. I haven't tried loading movies yet.I have a Nokia E71 (also thin) and carry it and the iPod, the Nokia for phoning, typing, some ebooks already on it, email, and web. I have a $12.27 app on the Nokia that makes it a portable router, so the iPod Touch, which has WiFi, can even surf the web and check email with its bigger screen anywhere my Nokia can.I learned of the iPod Touch from my grandkids, so I knew what I was getting before I ordered. The Amazon site was quite accurate.The only downside I can think of is the typing, which is slower than a keypad because it's so easy to hit the wrong character on the touchscreen.Great device.
5	1297209600	I love this ipod! It met all my expectations. One of the best features for me is the fact that I can control my Apple TV with this. I can also stream Pandora and any video to the Apple TV from my ipod! This product rocks. Thanks Apple for coming up with a great product!
5	1297209600	I'm not a hugely tech-savvy person, so I can't really techno-speak to the iPod Touch's (4th gen) technology. LOL But I can give you a personal anecdote. For Christmas, all my 17yo son wanted was an iPod Touch...which was good, because at $200, that's about as far as the Christmas dollars could stretch. We bought the thing, and I wondered what it had to offer that was worth the price. I still had my old-school Shuffle (the long, white plastic thing that looked like a space-age pack of gum), and was quite snobby about my lack of "need" for anything else than some music to bring to the gym. So my son adored his gift, and was completely absorbed by it. He started showing me what it did, all the apps, etc. I admit to being impressed by the touch screen and graphics, the fun apps, and the ability to get online thru our wi-fi. but I still thought of it as child's play...some overpriced electronic toy for babes. Then my husband surprised me with one. I was slightly dismayed at first, thinking, "How can he waste $220 on this thing I don't need?" I already had a Kindle (3G, wi-fi), and my old Shuffle, right? I was all set. THEN I started using it....and became HOOKED. The first night I sat in my bed and was able to check my mail, update my FB status, find the hours of a local yarn shop, get directions to a tea shop, check rates on rental cars, download a couple songs for my next workout, sync to my Kindle, take my turn in a Scrabble game with a friend, and read about insomnia...I decided I can't live without it. LOL So there's the story of how one suburban 40-something mom found out her new "techno toy" was as necessary as oxygen. I hope this helps another suburban mom out there on the fence. ;)
4	1297123200	My first iPod purchase was 6+ years ago. At that time I purchased the 32G iPod.  This served my intended purpose, however with getting the new 8G iPod Touch I now see what I have been missing! Unfortunately, or fortunately my old iPod life ended, which caused me to be in the market for a new iPod. I have only had this since 2/5/11, however I have enjoyed figuring out how this one works! I have a DROID Touch phone, so I was already used to the "touch" aspect of operation.  I enjoy the ease of getting songs right from the iTunes store on my iPod.  My only "complaint" is that I have a docking station that I was able to use for my older iPod which allowed me to charge and listen to music, since I am sure the docking station is very outdated, I am not able to charge my iPod Touch with this, only able to listen to music. This just means that I will need to look for a new docking station! Not a deal breaker my any means.  Overall I love my new iPod Touch and I would recommened this to someone that is looking for a source to play and listen to music! Very glad that I purchased this!
5	1297123200	Awesome, I use it everyday. Want more space on it and the songs sound a little different than when I play them on my computer but overall it is a very good product and I would recommend it/
5	1297036800	I love the iPod touch, great item.  I'm glad I don't have to turn on my computer to look up things all the time, fast searching.  Love it.
5	1297036800	I have been checking the mail everyday for this bad boy. It arrived on time (today)... I've just been wanting it since before I ordered it. So far it is working great.I love my shiny new pretty!
4	1296950400	I love this iPod and would recommend it to anyone.  I had been looking for an eReader (preferably and decided to go with the iPod instead, with the Kindle app.  I am more than happy with my decision.  This iPod does everything... you can even use it as a phone if you pay for a service like Skype (although be warned, no 911 support).My only issue with it is that the battery life is only a few hours.  Fine for when I'm near a computer... but not so good when I'm out and about.  It does charge quickly though.
5	1296950400	THIS WAS SO WORTH WHAT MY PARENTS PAID FOR. I LOVE IT MUSIC SOUND CLEAR MOVIES LOOK. GREAT GAME PLAY "PERFECT". LIKE DRIVING GAMES U TURN THE I POD LIKE A WHEEL. ITS GREAT TO ADD SOMETHING OF YOUR OWN BUY A CASE FROM AMAZON THEIR GREAT I BOUGHT 8 ALL GREAT. I SOOOO RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THIS. I WAS SURPRISED OF THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT IM 14 YEARS  OLD I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL TEENS AND ADULTS. MY DAD PLAYS GAMES ON IT ON IT 2. MY BROTHER WATCHES YOUTUBE ON IT.  I LOVE THE CAMERA ON IT . I USE IT TO TAKE PICTURES OF MY PETS OVER ALL THIS DEVICE IS GREAT ITS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY AGE. :)
4	1296864000	It more like 4.5 stars than 4 stars. I bought this for my wife who is not very technical. The very best thing I can say about this product is that it has been added to her bag and she uses it regularly. Have not used all the features but the pain points have been minimal. It was easy to show my wife how to use wireless and turn it off when not in use. Any product that I only invest an hour in and she can take it from there is OK. Thumbs up.
5	1296864000	This is perfect for my daughter.  She can use it for her music as well as the internet.  It replaces her broken nano and has replaced the need for a smart phone.  Love it!
5	1296777600	It shipped very quickly, and I was very satisfied when I received it! It worked perfectly and the screen worked beautifully!
5	1296777600	this ipod is the best electronic i ever owned. It is so useful and fun at the same time. I recommend this to anyone who's interested in portable fun
5	1296777600	My wife bought an iPod Touch recently after playing with a demo at the local big box retail store and was hooked. I heard so much about Apple products and was skeptical at first. Boy was I wrong! I think we fight over who gets to use it more and more every day. I love finding new apps to add to the device, and with Apple's iTunes Store you're sure to find a bunch of useful tools and fun games to play. As a couple in their late 30's we have a new toy to play with like the cool kids. I won't add to what has already been said, but what you have here is the iPhone without the phone. I wish that they would add an option for 3G or 4G connection that you can get from your cellular provider for added wireless coverage. Maybe they'll save that for the 5th generation version.
5	1296691200	I'm not sure there's a lot I can add that hasn't been said already -great product, both practical and fun.
5	1296604800	I have researched and tried my next door neighbors ipod touch 8GB (4th Gen).  Reluctantly, my neighbor allowed me to borrow it for a couple of days.  After hands on use, plus a lot of question and answer, I am convinced that Apple's newest ipod will do everything they represent.  My prior ipod was a 1st Gen Shuffle.  I have used the shuffle, and will continue to use it, when I ride my sports motorcycle, go hiking, and general outside activities.I purchased this unit with from Amazon with the Audible $100 dollar discount promotion.  My total cost was $109 out the door!  My only complaint is with Amazon's Customer Service.  The representative was professional, but I had to struggle to understand her broken English.  I have no issues with different cultures and diverse minority groups.  As a matter of fact, I'm a minority, and learned to speak well with appropriate diction.  When I call to make an important purchase decision or resolve issue, I don't want to struggle to understand what is being said.Other than this questionable customer service experience, I have to say, the Ipod Touch's newest has clearly defined the terms "User Friendly."If you are on the fence, you need to buy the Ipod Touch 8GB (4th Gen), and be happy!Geek Wannabe
5	1296518400	The IPOD touch 8GB 4th generation is an awesome little gadget. My kids love it. I actually like it myself and wonder why I don't have one. I really didn't know what I was missing. I highly recommend this product for kids and adults alike.
4	1296518400	When I was a kid and got the Mattel handheld football game with the red dots as players I thought how incredible it was.  The I-touch is truly incredible.  It is amazing how much they have packed into such a small thing.  Now the kids can play on this and quit asking to take my phone....I hope.
5	1296518400	I bought a new iPod from Amazon recently and installed QQ Chat App (an instant messenger from Tencent which is a very popular tool on Windows among many Chinese users). A amazing fact I found is that, after this installation (no matter launching it or not), the battery run out quickly: after a full charging without any use, my iPod was totally dead after 8~10 hours, even if I closed all applications when not using (i.e. double clicking the Home button to show all active icons, pressing an icon for a while to have the (-) sign appear, and closing them all). After I deleted QQ from my iPod and tested again, a full charging lasted as long as normal. This finding has resolved a big puzzle for me, because I originally thought it was an issue of defective battery so that I even had the iPod I bought from Amazon replaced by another brand new one from a local Apple store, but got no improvement at all.Hope it will help someone who has a similar issue.
5	1296345600	I enjoy and love my I pod touch so much I purchased my wife one, now we facce time alot other then using the phones. I learn more about the touch everyday.
1	1296345600	NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT  IT HAS BEEN THREE WEEKS AND NOTHING. CANCELED PRODUCT  TOOK TO LONG TO RECEIVED
5	1296345600	its great and for a great price too! all other ipods were very expensive plus its can get big print for bad vision
5	1296259200	Love everything about it! Easy to set up and use! Saved money with Amazon. I use it on a regular basis. Everything I wanted and expected from an iPod.
5	1296259200	This was a present for my 15 year-old son.  He loves it -doesn't leave the house without it.  The face time is great and he loves the imovie.
5	1296259200	I haven't yet tried the movie features so I didn't rate them but everything else works great.  I have no complaints as yet.I use it to listen to audio books mostly.  I like to read but sometimes I like to listen to books while doing work.
4	1296259200	Well, I took the plunge after about 5 months and decided to get this Ipod Touch. I was a little skeptical about purchasing this one since I already had an Ipod Touch 2G and had gotten bored of it after about 3 months. This one is definitely a keeper. I like all the upgrades that were made to it since the 2nd generation. The Retina display is amazing. The two cameras are good. The size is better. Glad they added a microphone. The speaker is ok.The Retina display has to be the best display I've ever seen on any mobile device. It doesn't matter how much you zoom in on most text, it's still razor sharp. Videos, photos, etc. look remarkable on this screen. Kudos to Apple for creating such a wonderful screen.Although the cameras are not more than 1mp each (not even 1.5mp combined) but at least you have them and 2 of them for that matter. I'm not a big fan of taking pictures with mobile devices so I haven't even tried them out yet. The main reason I like the fact that it has the cameras is for video calls. I never thought that I would like that the person on the other end could see me but it's actually grown on me (just becareful where you are when you answer, don't want to take a video call while you're on the crapper). It also says you can make 720p HD videos but I wouldn't expect the quality to be all that great from a .7mp camera. I would have liked to get the 5mp camera from the Iphone 4 but it's still nice to have the 2 cameras.As most products are getting smaller and smaller, so too did the Ipod Touch become smaller. When I first received it I was impressed with the size due to the fact that it had all these features packed into such a small package. I honestly think it's too thin, I like my mobile devices to have a little bit of bulk. Despite the size, it has good weight so it doesn't feel too light. It's definitely more pocketable than before, not that previous versions were all that bulky to begin with, and moreso than almost any other device.The microphone is a nice addition. It's great for making video or phone calls. It's also great for use with the voice controls. It's better than having to use a headset with a microphone like on previous generation Touch's. It's also useful in apps like the T-pain app. Definitely glad to see they included it.The speaker is about average. Sometimes it's too loud, sometimes it's too quiet. I was happy when they added the speaker on the 2nd generation but this one really doesn't make much of an improvement.Some of the cons are: the lack of GPS and 3G. I would have liked for them to include these 2 features because you're not always going to have a Wi-Fi connection. Sometimes it feels useless if you take it out of the house, you're somewhat limited on use. The GPS would have been nice for better accuracy as well. It's already the 4th generation, I would like to see the Touch get 3G capability.Overall, it's a great product. Apple has certainly made great strides from the 1st generation Ipod Touch till now. Some people, including Steve jobs, have said that the Ipod Touch 4G is the Iphone 4 without the phone. I would say it's the Iphone 4 without the phone, contract, GPS, 3G, 5mp camera and IPS. I'm not a big fan of Apple but I definitely like their Ipod Touch line. There are still some improvements that can be made. I will definitely keep this one for the long haul or until they make some vast improvements over the 4th generation.
5	1296259200	for whoever is still debating about it,I was just like you and I thought I would waste 200 bucks for it,but since the moment I got the ipod touch 4g,I never regret buying it EVER EVER
5	1296172800	Without a doubt, this is one of the best electronic items to have in your arsenal.  To have all of the power and accessibility at you fingertips (in your shirt pocket)is an incredible engineering feat, and avails the user of most of the features that a small computer would give you.  I have had no issues with this product at all, and in spite of the relatively sketchy users manual online, there are plenty of websites that brought me up to speed quickly.  The facetime feature is smooth and vivid, and entirely user-friendly, and I have found it to be a convenient and fun way to connect with family and friends.
5	1296086400	First iPod and loving it.  FaceTime is awesome, but I feel like it drains the battery life too quickly.
5	1296000000	I BOUGHT A APPLE IPOD TOUCH 8GB FOR MY STEP SON CHRISMAS GIFTS AND IT WAS GREAT I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY BEST PRISZE THANKS TO AMAZON.COM
5	1296000000	Was brand new everything worked great, and using it to listen to music at this exact moment. The cameras suck for pic's though but everything else is perfect.
5	1296000000	this was a gift for my son and he has not put it down since the day he received it.  The entire experience with Amazon was great and satisfying (from start - to finish)
4	1295913600	The Ipod touch came as expected "new", the supplier was excellent to showed up three day's after the order confirmation (highly impressed). Not happy with the equipment though, as with my 2gen it freeze's at times. I am hopping that it doesn't have touch screen issues as my Iphone3,4 and IPod touch have had.I would definitely purchase from this supplier again, maybe not the Ipod touch.
5	1295913600	I purchased the ipod touch - 4th generation, to help in my work. I'm daily finding more uses for it than I ever imagined. It has been an excellent purchase for me.
5	1295827200	I always have it with me, it's super nice and handy, one thing i truly hate though is the back of it, why why whyyyyy does it have to be this way :/ ?
4	1295827200	the money you save on the IPod touch will go to your new headphones fund the head phones are a piece of $H!+ they brake so fast and made of a cheep material -___-
5	1295827200	I use it to play Pandora Radio and to listen to podcasts. The internal speaker is ok, but I dock it sometime mostly when I am listening to music, or use headphones. The only thing I do not like about it is that it is too large to carry to exercise.
5	1295827200	The iPod touch seems to serve my needs well. I was choosing between that and a tablet. I already have a netbook. I chose iPod because I can't afford an iPad, other tablets (android) 5 or 7 inch look interesting, but the latest versions are not available yet. I don't want to pay for cell phone use. I got something small and handy.I have been loading it up with free apps related to my interests, which are readily available.The iPod touch is small and light, but the screen quality is excellent. I'm having fun with the touch interface, which is simple & effective. I got the 8GB model to to reduce the cost (got a good deal on that model). So far I haven't strained its storage capacity. I have not been loading it with videos, or even with much of my extensive mp3 collection - yet.The camera is useful for skyping, and probably all sorts of impromptu photo taking.The touch keyboard is pretty easy to use without too many frustrating mis-touches. I haven't found any way to work with MS office docs yet. I can view pdf files, and the zoom in/out is very useful. Likewise for Google earth - very easy & handy. I can sync my current Firefox bookmarks & tabs. I may get another browser than Safari. In general, browsing is good for reference & lookups, but more tedious for extensive browsing. Good for when a computer is not available. I have not used Facetime yet - I don't know who of my friends would have that available - yet.I hope the iPod Touchwill prove very useful when travelling in Europe. I have already loaded maps, local train & transportation schedules, etc. I hope to have a quick way to check email. That will depend on WiFi availability, so I would make use of the WiFi finder apps. It should also be very handy for keeping my schedule, todo list, itinerary, calendar readily available. And the small size would be an asset.Many of these functions are offered by other devices, perhaps at less cost. The iPad combines a lot in one package.Compared to the latest Kindle (which I also have) the iPod is a different beast. Kindle is better for simply reading (what it was designed for). Kindle is light and 'big pocket size', and has an amazing battery life, and in my case better WiFi connectivity at home. The iPod does many things well, in color, and goes far to compensate for the small screen with very good resolution and easy to use zoom in/out.Summary:Very useful, a bit expensive (maybe wait and compare next generation of android pads?), get higher storage if you think you'll need it. If this is what you want, and you also plan to pay for a cell phone anyway, consider the iPhone, which has GPS and better cameras.If cost is no concern, get an iPod touch or iPhone or iPad.
5	1295827200	I bought this iPod for my 17 yr old son. He absolutely loves it. He has downloaded all kinds of free apps and can even call & text me from it. We will definitely upgrade to the 32GB. You will need more capacity if you are planning on downloading videos or movies. I would definitely reccommend this product.
5	1295827200	Other than a few minor complaints, I absolutely love my iPod and would be lost without it. The addition of the camera is excellent, although it's not as good as some would have hoped for. It does lack a flash which is disappointing, but it's not that big of a deal. I wish they had put real GPS on it and not sure why they didn't. Battery life is pretty decent if you manage your apps well. The external speaker is a nice addition, but don't expect much quality from it, obviously.Overall I'm really very pleased with my iTouch, and I really like the new features of the fourth generation.
5	1295827200	It's an apple .. what can I say?  Went through several MP3 players before we bought the Ipod Nano.  When it was time to upgrade, there was no question as to which product to get.  It does everything my daughter wants to do.  Good sound quality and easy to use.  Great game application.  Would strongly recommend getting a protective case for it.  My friend purchased one for her son for Christmas and he accidently dropped it and the glass screen shattered.  With the new design and the glass covers to the edge of the unit, it is not as protected as the last model.  The 8 gig seems to work good for my daughter which saved me some $$.  Overall, great product!
5	1295827200	This is my first ipod i have ever owned, and i can't tell you how much i love it!!!The only thing i wasn't too impressed by was the camera and picture taking quality. But the retina display is fabulous!I'm so glad i got it!
5	1295827200	Every one else needs to realise that the Apple product is simply the best out there right now, nuff said.
5	1295740800	If you just want an mp3 player to play music, there are plenty of great choices out there. But if you want a device that can do it all...and more, then it doesn't get any better than the iPod touch. But understand with all the cool apps available, you'll be filling up that 8 gigabytes on no time! Simply the best of the best!!!
4	1295740800	I love my "touch"!  I received mine (8gb) for a birthday present and ended up buying one for my husband for Christmas (the 32gb).  I will say that the different applications that you can upload to this device are amazing and there are so many different kinds.  I like that most applications are free or only a few dollars to purchase.  I have installed the Kindle app, and I now have over 30 books in my Kindle library.  It is so nice to be able to read at the touch of a button, I don't have to worry about lugging two or three books around and it is super convenient when sitting in the doctor's office or anytime while waiting, it really helps to pass the time.  There are so many different applications, it would be insane to list them all, but my favorites are (in addition to the Kindle app): Textfree app; Allrecipes.com; the Facebook app; the Google app; I would say that it would be nice if it had a little slot for a stylus or something to use when typing as sometimes I tend to fumble or misspell words as it is not incredibly accurate. Also the camera is not incredibly amazing and I'm surprised that it doesn't have a larger megapixel capability considering the leaps and bounds technology has made (this is why it only received 4 stars).  However the overall use of this product is awesome.  Also...I would suggest spending the extra $$ for the bigger size too...videos and photos take up A LOT of room.  I would rate this at a 4.5...there's always room for improvement!  :)
5	1295740800	This has to be the best gift we ever gave my Granddaughter.  She just loves it.  Now we just need to get the earphones out of her ears so she'll be a bit more social.
5	1295654400	The iPod Touch is probably the absolute best that Apple has to offer. There's nothing you can't do with this amazing, all-inclusive, piece of technology. I bought this one for my pre-teen daughter. Now, almost everyone in the house has their own.
5	1295654400	Love my new Ipod Touch 4th Gen!  It looks great, and it connects to Wifi quicker than my laptop.
4	1295654400	Overall I am addicted to it and love it but for the price, camera, some phone issues, sound quality, battery life and app crashing/rip offs Ill have to give it 3 stars because it could be much better.Phone issues I noticed when I called home and tryed to leave a message on the answer machine I couldnt even hear my voice just a bunch of noises like wind. I was in my car at the time. Tryed it again at home and I could hear myself normal for about 3 seconds then heard a lot of feedback and squealing sounds. Also the voice mic Im told isnt that clear to people I call though I can hear them and everyone around them clear as day.Games look great. The tilt technology sucks though and depending on the game or app it could crash sometimes. Youll probably want to buy the highest GB ipod touch you can get if you want to fill it up with games. Apps and games are usually soso, theyre all works in progress and are updated every so often depending on how many complaints they get. A lot are ripp offs and I dont understand how Apple can allow them to exist on the market.The back camera is no where as perfect as advertised, its pretty grainy and the lowest pixels possible.Sound quality isnt as good as my old 80GB ipod but Im told it depends on the headphones you use.Battery life will last all day without use or with just texting. With games and video it gets eaten up fast.
1	1295654400	You have to have the sight of an Eagle to read the serial number on the back of the ipod touch and if you dont read it exactly to support they will deny you service. I only had it one day and it is not backwards compatible, Apple claims to be truly integrated so It 'Just Works'..You have to buy updated software just to sync this Ipod which may cost hundreds of dollars. I have a Mac with Itunes loaded but its not current and cant be updated unless you buy the new software. They are getting too cocky at Apple. So if you buy a $1000 plus dollar Mac, it will be obsolete in 5 years or less.
5	1295568000	Bought this for my Dad for Christmas.  My daughter loves to Facetime with Papa.  Part of the installation process was to copy his music from an older device.  Using the Touch, I was able to provide step by step support while he held the phone up to the screen during a Facetime session.  The camera's focusing ability really allowed me to see what was going on.
5	1295568000	MY SON WAS NEVER SO TICKLED WHEN I GOT THIS IPOD TOUCH FOR HIM FOR XMAS. IT WAS THE BEST GIFT HE GOT THIS YEAR. HE NEVER WANTS TO PUT IT DOWN....
3	1295568000	When I first opened the ipod up and start using it, it was great. Everything was working fine, until an hour later. It froze out of no were!!!!! I fallowed directions and tried to restore it, but it goes back to the screen with the apple logo and has some kind of debugger message on it. WTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I spent to much money on this thing to have it break on the first day!!!
5	1295568000	I got this for my Boyfriend for Christmasall he really does is play angry birds (grr)sound isn't great with out the headphones but if you plug it up to your car its awesome!Video is good, only watched a music video so I`m no expert.No problems with it its a great little machine nothing really more to say its worth it. Does everything an Iphone does except for the calling.price went down since I purchased it so lucky you haha
5	1295568000	this thing does everything it says it does and it does it well. apple really designed a good product. i bought 2 of the 4th gen 8gb versions for each of my 2 older daughters aged 7 and 8 for xmas.  My only complaint is that I feel these things are robbing them of creativity and ability to socialize with other kids because they are so addictive.  Where kids used to come over and play, they now pull out their itouch's, or parents iphones and play games (separately!)  What will the next generation turn out to be?Also, if buying this for younger kds, please do use the parental controls. I dont think kids should be on youtube or hav permission to download apps without parental supervision. we found this out the hard way, but luckily the parental controls work.  Do I wish every kid in the neighborhood didn't have one so i didnt have to buy one or even 2? absolutely! am i glad i bought these instead of dsi xl's? absolutely. my wife and i use these as much as the kids do now. We have an old 2nd generation 32gb which we are giving to our 3 yr old to play dora games on since the 2 older girls no longer play with her.if u are an adult considering buying this fo yourself, i say go ahead, you will love it. i think 8gb is fine, unless you really plan on downloading a bunch of movies to watch on the plane and dont plan on bringing ur laptop with you. While i dont watch movies on these things and have no intentions to do that, i can see why some people might.
5	1295481600	The high quality of the Ipod Touch is another example of why Apple dominates the MP3 player market.  Streaming Netflix is a breeze, though of limited use in the home. The sound quality is excellent and the wealth of apps makes it a very good purchase.
5	1295481600	I bought this as a gift for my Mom.  She loves it, and the product is exactly what I expected.
5	1295481600	THIS IPOD TOUCH IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD!!. ABSOLUTLEY PERFECT, GREAT QUALITY CAMERA, DOES EVERYTHING IT SAYS AND DOES IN WONDERFULLY! I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 0-150!!!!! THIS IS SOOOOOOOOO COOL, WAY BETTER THAN THE LAST GENERATION THAT I PREVIOUSLY OWNED, PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET IT!!!!!!
5	1295481600	Very happy with this ipod.  love the airplay capability, and the facetime app is awesome (although it only works with snow leopard macs).
5	1295481600	I love this product! My ONLY regret is that I didn't get a higher capacity model.I paired it with a rechargeable speaker deck that is a super great addition. On the go or at home it makes great sound.I use the iPod for music, games, Netflix, Audible books and more. It's a keeper. I wish I had more space and an expansion port would be great and also I worry about the battery life over time. It lasts me the day and I recharge at night, but when the battery life ends overall, I think I will have to send it somewhere to get a replacement, or buy a new one. That's disturbing.One thing that upset me (and this has nothing to do with the product itself) was that when this item arrived it was packaged very poorly. It was rattling around inside the box with virtually NO PACKING.
5	1295395200	Purchased this for my 20 year old daughter.  It's simply amazing.  With its wireless capability it's like having a mini computer that you can carry in your pocket.  The number of Apple apps and games is incredible.  Whereas my daughter used to carry around her HP notebook for accessing the web she can now use her ITouch.  Apple really outdid themselves with this device.  It's worth the extra money that Apple charges when stood side by side against competitor MP3 players.
5	1295395200	got this for my wife for x-mas so she could use it on our motorcycle trips. have not had a chance to use it out on the road yet but i know its going to work out great! need to get a good set of earbuds so she doesnt have to put up with the noise of my bike!!!!!!
5	1295395200	All I can say is this ipod is amazing. The only complaint I have is they advertise 8gb but it is only 6.5gb because of the software that has to be on the ipod. Other then that this thing is incredible. Extremely user friendly. Can't believe I never owned one!
5	1295308800	I don't know how good it works, because, it was a gift for my son. However the warranty is great. Four days after Christmas a Red Bull blew up in his backpack allover the I-pod. It wasn't ruined but it did not work 100% so he took it to the apple store and they replaced it. Easy. I like that.
5	1295308800	Love this device! I got it for my 10 year old and she loves it too..of course. I really like the internal speakers, they sound great and I don't have to worry about my child's hearing loss with headphones. I spent several hours setting up the ipod: dumped itunes (which NEVER syncs correctly) and safari (because it doesn't have adequate parental controls..I added Mobicip for safer browsing and a bunch of game & apps. I did have a problem with shipping. Ordered from Amazon with Prime and had to call because a week later it still wasn't here. The huge problem was that this was Dec 23rd and I needed it for the 24th! Amazon was so nice the express mailed another ipod that arrived on the on the 24th!
5	1295308800	My son is having so much fun with this product.  He especially likes the video with this as his previous one did not have this.
5	1295308800	I gave this to my partner for Christmas, and he LOVES it!  Can't rate battery life yet because it is so new.  He's using it as a camera, video recorder, works with our new wi-fi, too, so he can surf the net, access email, etc.  I'm ignorant when it comes to a lot of technology, but if he loves it, the product must be good!
4	1295308800	I bought this for my 11 yr old daughter for Christmas.  She wasn't expecting it.  However, she hasn't put it down yet so I believe it's great so far.  I may have to take it away that's how great is is.  Overall I'm happy w/ the purchase and the shipping was really fast and packaged correctly.
5	1295308800	Love it.  The IPOD is simply awesome.  I wish there was a 16 GB model available though.  I got the 8 GB and it fills quickly if you have a lot of video.  I would recommend getting the 32 GB even though it is a little overkill in the space department.  It is better to have too much space then not enough.
5	1295222400	You can never go wrong with Apple products.  I bought this as a gift for a friend who was thrilled to receive it.  The set up took us a little bit of time to get going, but once it was done, we had fun trying all the great features.  My only regret is that I didn't get the model with the 32g.
5	1295222400	This was a gift for my 14 year old son.  He loves the iPod!  He recently added the Skype App and he and his girlfriend who has an iPhone are able to visit and talk without ever having to leave home.  The music and gaming apps are also great.  This was a terrific gift for a teenager.
5	1295222400	This was a Christmas gift for my son.  I was very pleased with the purchase....free shipping and no tax on the item so it was cheaper than purchasing in a store. Another added plus was a free $25 amazon gift card with purchase.  My son couldn't have been happier!! Now he can use the gift card to purchase accessories for the ipod! Will return to Amazon for future purchases.
2	1295222400	Sorry to all those Apple fans who have happily accepted all the requirements Apple demands in order to use their devices. I am not one of you and protest the fact that I am required to submit my personal information in order to simply "activate" a device I just spent hundreds of dollars on. This, along with creating an iTunes account, entering credit card information that I never plan to use is ridiculous. If raising children wasn't so expensive, I'm sure they would ask for my first born child as well, they already have my finances?Straight out of the box I am required to "activate" the device, otherwise it is completely useless.To activate? Download and install iTunes, plug in the device and follow the prompts.After activating this device for my son, I'm prompted that a software update should be made. Next, I download the update, again I'm required to agree to Apple's End User Agreement, has anyone read this? Then I install the very large software update for the device.Next, my son wants to browse the FREE applications on iTunes, guess what? You need to create an account WITH your credit card information, which is SAVED to your account. If I don't plan to purchase anything, why is this necessary and WHY save my information if I don't want you to have it to begin with??OK, after everything is said and done, I'm still trying not to disappoint my son with his new iTouch, he obviously does not have his own credit card at age 12, so this account is under MY name. At this point, he has already set up his iTouch for himself, now I am trying to set up an account on iTunes, maybe this is creating a conflict, but the iTouch is NOT always seen by my PC when it's plugged in and will not synchronize all the time when it IS seen.Keeping in mind my daughter has an iPod Nano which was NEVER "activated" and NEVER had the software updated, worked straight out of the box as expected, never had to create an iTunes account, but of course DID require downloading and installing iTunes on my computer.... this iTouch required an updated version of iTunes which I was forced to do in order to begin using it. Do you think there was an update patch? No, I had to download the entire updated version. This led to uninstalling the old version, then installing the new version... more frustrations.I had some movies at home that came with the Digital Copy version of the movie, I tried to get these onto the iTouch.... They currently reside in iTunes now, but will NOT synchronize to the device. Now the Digital Copy has been registered and remains useless. A mistake on my part, I selected the iTunes version and should have chosen a more generic version such as Windows Media.At this point, sometimes the device is seen by my computer, sometimes not. When it IS seen by my computer, sometimes it will synchronize, sometimes not. My son will literally spend HOURS working with this to get some games to synchronize so he can use it, but is becoming quickly frustrated with it. He has had it for less than a month. I realize my frustrations are helping to foster his frustrations, but this is far beyond what is expected of something this expensive.I don't expect Apple to change how they do business since too many people just accept it and are more then happy to allow them to continue business this way. It's just not for me.I'll take a standard media player with drag and drop options, no iTunes to download and install required, no activation required. As for the other capabilities, the Droid is looking pretty good right now. At least then I'm paying for a legitimate service.
5	1295136000	Great product.  Would have given 5 stars but  iTunes desktop software is not as intuitive as the itouch itself.  The product itself is awesome.  Our family of 6 all have itouch's and iPads.
5	1295136000	This iPod is as advertised.  Excellent capacity and the battery has long life.  Arrived in a timely fashion.  No signature was needed so be careful where you ask for the delivery.
5	1295136000	This is a very nice product.  Amazing so much technology can be put in such a small package.  Only wish it had longer battery life.
1	1295049600	I'll start of by saying this things is AWESOME when it works.  I got it for my daughter for Christmas.  It was this or a DS.  I figured an Ipod would be better  because of all the free and cheap apps compared to DS games.The first one I bought worked for a couple days and then locked up.  Amazon's return policy was a breeze and I was able to, thankfully, get another in time for Christmas.A month later the 2ND Ipod Touch locked up and wasn't charging.  I figured I'd so a "recovery" through iTunes and all would be well with the world.No so.  It keeps dropping the USB connection to my computer.  After HOURS of messing with it I realize it's not my computer or my laptop.  It's the device.  This thing is just a pain in my rear.So now I have a very upset daughter or thankfully is ok with getting a DS instead and THANKFULLY Amazon.com will take back this piece of junk like they did the first one.  I assumed the first one was a lemon.  It happens.  However, 2 in a row?  While I'd love to exchange it for another one, I can't do it.  What happens when the 3rd one decides to quit past the return policy time frame?So yes, it's completely awesome when it works, but I've had more trouble with these things than it's worth.  You've been warned!EDIT: November 5, 2012.So the DS was never as good as the iPod touch and she still wanted one.  i gave it ONE LAST SHOT.  3rd time is a charm, right?  Well, this last one has been great.  I've had no issues at all with it.  *head scratch*  Is it possible I got two duds in a row?  With my luck, yes.  She's has this 3rd one for well over a year now and plays with it daily.
1	1295049600	Seeing how no one is happy with this seller it would be nice if Amazon would grant a refund or even fill the order for us sooner than the 23rd (thats how long they told me it would be for their investigation).
5	1295049600	It's an Apple iPod...what else is there to say?  It does everything it's supposed to do.  Better price at Amazon, although you can not get the custom engraving.
2	1295049600	I bought this for my 16 year old daughter for christmas.  Last night she was changing covers and dropped it lightly on the floor and the glass shattered down the middle of the screen.  You would think that paying that much for a product, it would be a little bit more durable.  I own a touch screen cell phone and have dropped it numberous times and the screen is still fine.
5	1294963200	The iPod was a gift for my wife, and she loves it. She also received a docking station, with speakers, so she can use it in her office. She loves all the features available. The sound is great. It was a great buy and a great gift.
5	1294963200	I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  Was she ever surprised!!!  She loved it.  She loves the camera feature and finds checking facebook so much easier, as long as there is wifi available.
5	1294963200	...AND HE LOVED IT!! I don't think I ever gave anyone such a great and useful present. I just hope he will not trade me for it, haha! THANKS AMAZON, for the better offer in the market!
4	1294963200	Bought it for my wife who loves it. My only concern is whether I should have splurged for the 32G memory. Time will tell.
4	1294963200	The ipod touch came in a thin cardboard box, with one flap of bubble wrap around it, but over the course of its travels here, it came out of the bubble wrap and was sloshing around inside the box. I was glad it still worked when it got here.  We had problems at first getting it to sync to our computer and then had problems getting applications. It took forever to get her ipod updated to the most recent version.  Itunes and the ipod could be more user friendly when it comes to adding or deleting applications.  Our problem was that Itunes showed that the application was on the touch, but the touch did not have it.  It was virtually impossible to get the application on it until we got to a wi fi area in the city.  Then it magically appeared. Either way, it's kinda cool, but glad I didn't have much to do over Christmas cause this thing took alot of my time.
5	1294963200	I got my new ipod a week and a half ago and loving it sounds great battery life excellent being new to ipod world getting use to putting music on and taking music off is and was different from my other mp3 players it so easy to do all that it took no time to maneuver thought itunes finding new music and apps to make life more fun and exciting
5	1294963200	it doesn't get any better than this!  Keeps the kids busy when i'm busy!  Sure beats the TV or their Nintendo DS.
5	1294876800	amazon once again had the best price and awesome delivery! the itouch itself is another apple amazement! it did more than i ever thought an ipod would or should do. for example the facetime feature is not recommended for anyone under 17.  it exposes anything and everything LIVE! its video phoning basically. we also have a free app called text free with voice.  this product does everything a phone does as long as you are around wi fi.  again awesome product but use caution if purchasing for a child under 17.
5	1294876800	I travel a lot for my job.  I used to carry a laptop around all the time but it was a hassle;  getting it out each time at airport security, etc.  Even the lightest laptop weighs a lot when you have carried it with you for a week.  The final straw was when I dropped it going through at Wichita Airport and left the thing with TSA at LAX the next day and had to pay to have it shipped back to me.Now I use only my iPod Touch. I can keep up with email, check the news, listen to music or simply pass the time playing games.  Best of all, it fits into my shirt pocket.  There are no costs to operate it since it can work in any Wi-Fi hotspot.Don't know how I managed before.
5	1294876800	The new ipod touch is great - the camera and video features are fun.  We bought for our daughter for Christmas and she loves it.
5	1294876800	This was given as a gift and she was delighted.  Unfortunately she received two so I returned the one I bought her.
5	1294876800	I love the Itouch!  It is awesome.  You can do so many things with this.  You can listen to your favorite music, watch your favorite tv shows or movies, you can take pictures, surf the internet, read your email, download apps (This opens up endless possibilities.), and many other things.  I downloaded the Kindle app and love to read books on my itouch.  I wondered if I would like reading on my itouch, but after I tried it, I loved it. Many apps are free or are available for usually just a couple of dollars.The itouch is very user friendly.  It is not hard to use at all.  We own four of these (from the 1st generation to this one) and have never had trouble with any of them.  They are used every day by all the members of my family.The only thing you might consider is buying  something larger than 8G.  It depends on what you are going to do with it.  It you are going to put a lot of videos on it, that will take up a lot of memory.  The songs and apps don't take up as much memory.
5	1294790400	Like always and excellent product from apple, but battery life should be longer with games..camera its ok decent, i prefer video quality over pictures...
5	1294790400	This handy gadget does more than you can imagine for a hand held unit.My son loves it and hasnt put it down since christmas.It has many apps and you can add many!Great gift for the gadget person.:)reasonably priced
5	1294790400	I wasn't sure what kind of ipod I was going to get, until I saw the new ipod touch. This is just great! There are so many different and great things that you can do with this. I can take pics, listen to music, download all different kinds of apps, etc... I have downloaded a few games and the graphics on it are fantastic! I am also able to listen to what ever type of music I choose off my ipod while I am playing my games. It is so cool. I definitely recommend this. I do however wish that I had been able to get the higher GB ipod. If you can afford it, go bigger. Even if you don't think that you will use, trust me...you will be able to find things to put on it.
3	1294790400	what is wrong with the battery? even when not using it, and having fully charged the battery, the device is dead in less than a day. i dont understand how a product so innovative could have such a poor battery life. everything else is great but i am hardly able to use it because of the battery. its like you have to fully charge it and then use it immediately. even when you shut it off it still drains the battery. doesnt make sense...
5	1294704000	I purchased two of these.  They are the most amazing item.  GREAT price and received quicker than expected.
5	1294704000	I bought this ipod for my 14 year old and she loves it and is very happy with it.  She hasn't used the face time on it yet so I can't rate it. Very happy.
5	1294704000	This iPod is a replacement for my 2g iPod which broke down this past summer. I was disappointed, as I only used my iPod occasionally as a source of music while at the gym. The power switch refused to work, so the only way to turn it on was to use the USB connected to my PC, but alot of good that would do me away from home. In fairness, I bought one for my 12 y/o grand-daughter at the same time. Hers looks as though it's been to both Iraq and Afghanistan and is overloaded with vids, pics, apps & music. Still works like a charm. I retired mine and it now sits in a drawer to gather dust.My new iPod has some new features, most notably, the Facetime camera. I enjoy using that and feel that you now really get value for your money, since this iPod didn't cost much more than my first one. All other features work flawlessly, including connection to wifi for surfing and email. As you already know, there are tons of apps available for this device. I bought an ifrogz case for it, in order to protect the backside from scratches and smudges. Although I had a disappointing experience with my first iPod, I'd still recommend this little marvel of technology!
3	1294704000	I got this for my daughter and she loves it.  It is a pain, though, since you almost HAVE to use iTunes on your computer and it is not very versatile in how you use storage and access music.  It is a quality product and the hardware is so much above other mp3 touch knock-offs.
5	1294704000	I bought this Ipod as an anniversary gift for my husband. He has used it everyday since he received it & attached it to the axillary port in his truck. The price was perfect...especially with the $15 gift card!
5	1294704000	I bought this Ipod Touch for my 10 year old.  It is the perfect electronic.  She can text with it, so I have staved off the begging for a cell phone again for a while.  She has enjoyed listening to her music, playing games, buying apps and downloading free apps to no end.  I have actually had to limit her usage because I want to be sure she doesn't become obsessed!  As always, Apple's quality is top notch.
5	1294617600	Santa brought these for my two teeanage girls this Christmas and they love them! They are having a ball with all the games and music they downloaded.We don't have wi-fi at home but are huge Starbucks junkies so they make sure to bring them when we go so they can do all the texting and chatting while we are there.  They are huge hits at my house!  Santa scored this year!! :o)
4	1294617600	After 2 tries... the new IPOD showed up... minus the special Christmas engraving that we wanted for our son this Christmas.  The product is incredible and I would highly recommend the new IPOD Touch, and hopefully Apple will be sending an update to fix the alarm feature.What is sad, is that the first IPOD we ordered with the Christmas Engraving somehow got lost in the transit.  I contacted Amazon for a replacement and they were very fast with sending one... Awesome... only without the engraving.... bummer.
5	1294617600	Got more than I bargained for. I was simply in the market for an iPod touch, knew nothing about generations, I was pleasantly surprised when my son told me he had the latest generation. I got this at a great bargain!
5	1294617600	Great product.  I bought this mainly to use as a universal remote.  A logitech Harmony is $160 or so, and for the extra money you get a lot more functions from the ipod touch.  I have an ipad, and I actually use the touch now more than the ipad.  The small size allows me to take it everywhere, and the front facing camera lets me video chat on skype and face time.  When this first came out several years ago, I didnt understand its purpose.  Its the apps.  Would recommend to anyone.  My only con would be battery life.  I'm so spoiled by the ipads battery life, that I'm almost surprised how quickly the itouch is depleted.
5	1294617600	I gave the Ipod to my husband for the holidays - He loves it and I am thinking on getting one for myself
5	1294531200	I think  I like the itouch 4G because of its camera. I can skype with my friends on skype. They can see my face. This version of product is thiner than 3G. Willing to see iPad 2 / Mac Pro.
5	1294531200	Bought this for someone else, but with the gift card I kept for myself, it was cheaper than any place I searched. As for how it works: it's a friggin Ipod... It works how it's supposed too.
5	1294531200	The iPod touch is another great product from Apple. The only thing you could ask (though you won't get it) is for them to offer the occasional sale or price reduction. The Face Time aspect of the 4th generation version is a big hit with our three girls and their cousins. They can video chat from different homes in different cities without any trouble (provided everyone has wi-fi access). Apps like text free allow them to text each other and myself as well.It would be great to have more capacity, but it costs quite a bit to jump to the next size.
5	1294531200	My daughter got this for Christmas. She wont put it down, it has replaced her laptop, her camera and her mp3 player. We are very happy with it.
5	1294531200	this is my first i pod and im glad i got the touch 4. the best toy i ever had !!
5	1294531200	This was actually a gift for my daughter, so I haven't had much time to use it, but she is loving it!! She has downloaded lots of apps for games, sounds, and lots of other things. She even sends texts from it and talks/sees her friends using Skype and the two cameras on the iPOD. We have played several games together on it and the battery lasts for a lot longer than other iPODs. Great product!
4	1294531200	Came on time for christmas.  Would suggest you tag on the products neededto complete the Ipod.
5	1294444800	some advice never take free supersaver shipping its slower that a dead turtleother than that it all gd
5	1294444800	The last iPod Touch I owned was a 2d generation version.  This 4th gen iPod Touch makes some notable improvements.  It is exactly what we've come to expect from Apple - a great product, innovation ahead of the curve, and fairly priced (not inexpensive, but well worth the price).
4	1294444800	I have and have enjoyed the iTouch 3rd generation, but couldn't resist getting the new 4th generation because it has a camera and video.  This new 4th generation iTouch is smaller and thinner -- way thinner - almost to the point where it's difficult to handle.  Because of this, the camera is difficult to use, and I don't think the pictures are quality.  I will say the new custering of email accounts, and being able to open all inboxes at once is very handy.  The sound is slightly better (using the unit without ear phones) as there is a bit more volume.  In all, I think you'll like it as any iTouch -- but I hope Apple doesn't take them any smaller, or else the ability to enjoy it will be greatly diminished.
5	1294444800	I recently purchased the new iPod Touch to replace my Nano. I absolutely love it and enjoy the many free apps. I also enjoy having it in the car so we can listen to our music and not the radio. The camera isn't the greatest, but I didn't buy it for the camera, so I'm happy!
3	1294358400	I purchased this product mainly for facetime feature and it sucks big time. While I do not have absolutely any issue with LogitechVid or Skype video calling from my home wifi, the facetime thing takes very long time to connect and frequently fails to connect. I am not returning it but very disappointed. Don't understand whay there is so much hype on such an average quality item.Also, I get only about 2.5 hours of battery life for facetime or if my son plays video game [with a full charge]. And it takes VERY LONG time to recharge. Very disappointing indeed.
5	1294358400	The iPod works great, no problems. Highly recommended for children as an all-in-one: video and still camera, music player, hand-held video game player, etc.!!! Got a great deal from Amazon as well. Thanks!
5	1294358400	I swear this is one of the best gifts I could have ever given myself I love love love it. You can do virtually everything on here. Camera is not so bad and anyway I didn't buy it for the camera.
4	1294358400	What can I say, it's an Ipod! My 6yr old daughter loves it. It has everything. The camera is a good touch but the pictures are not that great. No flash, they come out washed out. They should have more capacity. Once again Apple makes a product that is less then perfect on purpose. Would it be so hard to add flash? I bet you next years model will!! They should be standard 16GB now that they can hold so much stuff. You still can't add memory. Overall, great.............for KIDS!
5	1294272000	I bought the I-touch from my 12 yr old grandson for Christmas.  At first I was concerned that the 8G would not have enough storage, however it is more than enough.  I asked my son how my grandson liked the i-touch and he told me that he likes it so much that he rarely puts it down.
5	1294272000	Ordered two for my daughters.  Unlimited fun for them.  Awesome apps (can video chat with them at anytime). There is so much that they can do.  Been an apple fan for a long time.  Another great product.  Thank you Steve Jobs!!
5	1294272000	Unless you've been living under a rock you know all about the device.  This was a gift to my son (11) and he needed help with linking to the iStore and our home wifi, but it wasn't hard.  Apps can be purchased easily but he doesn't know the password to avoid problems.  He decided to use over-the-ear headphones rather than the buds that come with it or smaller headphones/earphones since most are made for larger heads and ears.  Over all, it's a cool device.
4	1294272000	Apple Ipod is very reasonable.Its the Mp3 of the generation.It not only supports Mp3 play but also it supports thousands of (paid and free) games which can be a huge stress buster and fun.The applications available in Apple iTunes store are amazing.
4	1294272000	Quick shipping. Good condition. Ipod freezes for short periods occasionally, but I wont attribute that to seller. Overall good purchase.
5	1294185600	Though I bought iTouch as a replacement for my 3-year old iPod Nano, it actually proved to be a good replacement for my now obsolete Palm Pilot and to an extent my mobile.The Good:* Easy sync of email and calendar: I found its integration with my email and calendar to be seamless. The set ups were simple and self-intuitive. With Palm I could never sync my office calendar and email. It was always a duplication of efforts.* Freebies on Appstore: I don't have to talk about iTunes Appstore considering how popular Apples Appstore is.* Nice form factor: The form factor is great. Again, I don't have to talk a lot about this. Initially I found it difficult to hold it considering how slippery the metal back was, but the silicone accessory took care of that.* Wi-fi connectivity: Superb wi-fi connectivity.* Capacity: for me the 8-gig iTouch is sufficient to get most of my work done.The Bad:* Can't think of any.
3	1294185600	It is not that stable and I don't know whether or not it is common. The screen somtimes will freak out....
5	1294185600	Very easy to read and select the exact item I was looking for, shipped very promplty, and recieved it without a scratch.
5	1294185600	Our family loves this device.Grandparents and children. The addition of Facetime is wonderful. We used the Facetime a lot during the holidays with other family members who had an iphone or the iPod touch 4G.I highly reccommend this product for all ages.
4	1294185600	I have been a little out of touch with technology, but I bought the Itouch to upgrade an older model IPod.  I found the itouch super easy to use and get online with.  I love the features of downloading application and itunes right to the device.  The camera and video are nice added features, but not the best. Overall I am really happy with my itouch, BEST product I've bought in a long time.
5	1294185600	I got this for my 11-yr old daughter for Christmas.  She loves it.  I am so surprised to what this thing can do.  You can chat on it like an Iphone and see the other person's face like Skype, you can watch Netflix, take pictures  and text!  It was worth it.
5	1294185600	First impressions: wow, this is so thin and small -- makes my 3rd gen look a bit like a bulky oaf in comparison. Second impression: hey, this doesn't look like my iPhone 4 at all!A bit about me: I'm an MP3 diehard fanatic, I own or have owned almost every MP3 player of note. To name a few: iPod Touch 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th gen, iPod Classic, iPod Nano, Zune HD, Archos Android, 5, 605, 604, and so forth. I have a broad basis for comparison as I write my review.Down to brass tacks then, what do I love about my new Touch:1) Retina display -- Wow! That's a lot of pixels in a small space, the crispness and clarity of text and video is simply awesome.2) Slim form factor -- this is thinner and narrower than last years model. Its compact, easily fits in a pocket, while still having a little weight to give that quality feel.3) iTunes and the App Store -- still one of Apple's strongest features. iTunes continues to be the best interface for music, video and app purchases. While Zune Marketplace and Android are strong contenders, they aren't quite there yet.4) Easy upgrades -- the iOS upgrade system is as smooth as it gets, just plug it into iTunes and it happens smoothly and seamlessly.5) Dedicated power and volume buttons.6) Cool user interface -- possibly the best user interface although Zune and Android are also strong.7) Apps -- without question the Apps are the Touch and iPhone strongest feature, the most Apps and the best Apps.8) Accessories, accessories -- you just can't beat the easy availability and diversity of accessories available for iPod Touch. Its good to be at the top!9) Multitasking (or multi-what?) -- finally we have multitasking on an MP3 player! Ok, maybe I'm just a geek and nobody else cares... just a little tip: double click your home button to see what has been running in the background and sucking up your battery!10) External speaker -- improved quality since 3rd gen. Nice when you don't want to put on headphones to listen to a podcast or something.11) Cameras -- the only MP3 player I've ever had that can do facetime, take pictures, and record videos!12) Improved Wifi -- connects easily to my WPA secured U-Verse router, my 3rd gen can't do it. Makes this a good "small iPad" if that's what you're looking for.13) Improved sound -- its getting pretty good now, still not the best available but definitely better than 3rd gen was. I would say the sound quality has moved from 3 star to 4 stars now.
5	1294185600	This is the one thing my 16 year old wanted for Christmas.  He loves it.  I see it in his hand more than his cell phone anymore.  The only thing I was unsatisfied with was the packaging.  No protection for the device was placed into the box to keep it from bouncing all over the box during shipping.  I am thankful it works!  Purchased from Amazon.
5	1294185600	this is one apple best products that i brought for my grandaughter she has not put it down sense christmas it has some amazing feature lot of free apps the videos show great pictures the sound  with the headphone are great thanks apple tech support team is great just a phone call away
5	1294185600	Very easy to use and the touch screen is amazing.  Sounds quality is very good even hooked up to my car stereo as well as my iHome.  Just be aware that there really isn't 8GB of usable space as 1.4GB is used for the operating system and you only have 6.6GB of storage for music, videos, and apps.
5	1294185600	This was purchased for my husband that is 66yrs old.  Great for his retirement yrs.Enjoys all the features on it.
5	1294185600	I am the owner of a iPod Touch 2nd generation, but I wanted to get the 4th generation because it offers FaceTime. I have to say that I am very impressed with the product so far. I can use FaceTime wherever there is wifi, I can use applications, listen to music, and watch movies. Also, the HD video capture is very clear! I took some pictures and videos when I went to the beach, and they turned out fantastic! I would highly recommend this product for anyone who wants something fun and would like to have a device that can perform many functions. Instead of carrying a digital camera, I just take my touch and I can instantly share the pictures to Facebook for everyone to see.
5	1294099200	This was a Christmas present for our soon to be 5 year old son that just loves to play with mom and dad's iPhones.  We use it as a reward/punishment tool as well when he cleans up after himself or when he's roughing up his 2 year old little brother.It's amazing how quickly they learn to navigate to the games on our phones and even read the "Free" ones in the Apple Store.  He also loves to rearrange and delete apps from mom's phone.I locked his down as far a ratings (there are a ton of options) go and to be supersafe I have not enabled Wifi access either.  This works well for us as all we have to do is visit our desktop and Itunes for some fresh games.While a bit pricey for a toddler, it's far cheaper and more convenient than some of the other game systems out there like the DS, PSP, and even the Leapster line given all the additional accessories needed.As the title states, him having his own "phone" spares our phones from the potential accidents and allows us to actually use them.
5	1294099200	We bought this for my son for Christmas to replace the previous generation iPOD touch.  After saving for an entire year he bought his own 2 weeks before Apple announced the new 4th generation. Wish we would have known!!!  My daughter had asked for only this for Christmas and I felt very guilty that I had made my son save his own money to buy his and now would not have the new improvements of the gen 4.  The screen quality is better and the camera and video are a nice touch. These are the 1st iPOD's we have had in the family.  I now understand why people like them so much.  Mom and Dad get to keep the Gen 2.As always, no problem with buying at Amazon.  They had the best price at the time of purchase as well.
5	1294099200	Amazon did a great job listing the itouch cheaper than Apple does.  I bought it for my son at Christmas and he was thrilled.  My other son and I have the 3rd generation and can't wait to upgrade.  Great on price again, Amazon.  Free shipping was great but faster would be better!
5	1294099200	I bought the new generation Ipod Touch for my daughter for a Christmas gift. She has not stopped using it since she opened it on Christmas. I don't know everything that this Ipod does, but she loves everything about it. She was so excited when she found out that it has the capability of downloading apps like Facebook. She also loves the texting features. She has downloaded some music from the itunes store but this is so much like an iphone that she is still busy using other features. This is definitely worth the money. My teenager loves it.
4	1294012800	My daughter likes the new iPod touch 4th generation but one big thing to know is in order for this to work, you need to update your music download site such as iTunes to the newest version or the device wont load.  We almost returned it until a friend suggested the update and once that happened, it not only turned on but she was able to load and use it.
5	1294012800	I purchased this as a christmas gift and my son whom is 18 could not have loved it more! It arrived quickly and itwas so easy to purchase!
5	1294012800	I got this product for my Grandson.  He loves the item and is very pleased with the way it works and the things that it does.  In fact it was the only thing he asked for this Christmas.
5	1294012800	The 4th generation iPod Touch is another winner for Apple. The price is the same al last year's model, but this one does more and does it better. My 10 year old daughter uses "face time" with her friends daily. As a bonus, it can be used as a remote control for Apple TV. This does vwerything the iPhone does except make calls & send text messages. This is a winner. A winner that sells for about $15 less than local stores.
5	1294012800	My 16 yr old son asked for this for Christmas.  He loves this gadget and I've heard no complaints (which is wonderful for a teenager).I guess the $ was worth it!
5	1294012800	I love this. It does all I wanted it for and more!It came within a day or two of ordering. The best seller ever!
2	1293926400	My 13 year old, responsible, daughter received her IPod Touch 4th gen. for Christmas.  She was elated!!!  Today she went to unplug it from an under the counter music player when it slipped out of her hand and fell to the counter below.  The screen shattered.  I was able to witness the mishap or might not have believed it.  The IPod fell approximately 12 inches.  I and my 11 year old son have done the same with our IPod Touch 3rd Gen. with no damage.  BEWARE!!!!  The 4th gen. is not as durable.  I feel Apple sacrificed durability for the cool factor of how thin they can make it.  I strongly recommend getting a quality protective case for your IPod 4th generation.  It can not take what previous models could.  If we would have known this we would have made sure she had the protective case.  But she LOVES it and it was her main Christmas gift so we have to pay the $150 to have it replaced and will be investing in a quality protective case.  Sad, expensive end to the Christmas season.  If Apple is going to change the durability of a product, they should notify their customers in some way.  The Ipod should have been able to take such a benign mishap.  My 3rd generation has taken worse.  My sons 3rd generation has survived a year with an 11 year old boy.  4th generation is too fragile.
4	1293926400	Purchased as Christmas gifts for my nine year old and seven year old. Easy for kids and parents to use. No worries about cell phone application. The iPod Touch will be  linked to each other as well as Mom's iPhone. Great value.
5	1293926400	I purchased this as a present for an 18 yr old. She loves the itouch. She has not taken it out of her ears since she opened it!
5	1293926400	I purchsed this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, she absolutely loves it, so I purchased another one for myself.  There are already some great detailed reviews on this product, so I won't go into that.  Great customer service.
5	1293926400	Got this for Christmas and am having a good time with it.  There are lots of apps that you can download for free or very little cost.  I have downloaded pictures and music and all my contacts from gmail address book make an electronic address book - very cool!  Amazon's price was good too.
4	1293926400	Great product but the camera stopped working after 2 weeks. Returned it to an Apple store, and as they were unable to fix the problem I received a new one.
5	1293926400	My son has officially put down his Nintendo DS forever.  The only challenge is keeping it charged because he never puts it down.  Great gift.  He is using my itunes account so can't buy anything without my password.  I LOVE how happy he is with it.
5	1293926400	Amazon was awesome.  My original order got lost in shipment and when I contacted Amazon about the problem they were unbelievably fast about responding. They immediately sent another order next day air that arrived as expected. I love the I-Pods and my kids could have kissed me a thousand times over. They love the texting abilities and the "very cool" Apps. There are hundreds of free apps that are very fun and educational. My wife loves the Pandora app; she has it on all the time. There is even an app for white noise that I use while I am asleep.  I greatly appreciate the effort that Amazon put forth to make sure I received this order before Christmas and will most definitely continue to do my online business with Amazon.
5	1293926400	I shopped many stores and internet sites for the Apple iPod touch and finally bought it here on Amazon. Amazon had the best price, the best customer service and I always feel confident that i will get the best merchandise. This was a Christmas Gift for my nephew and he absolutely loved it. I always shop at Amazon first and get the best items. Bookmark Amazon and feel confident you are getting the best prices!The Apple iPod Touch is the best, my nephew was so excited, he wanted it for College so he can keep in touch with friends back on via skype and internet, download music and videos and play games. According to him, it's AWESOME!!!
5	1293926400	We got this for my 5 year old for Christmas and I cannot get him off of it .He loves it,is so easy for him to use since he is only 5 .Best Christmas gift EVERMIsty Miller
5	1293840000	VERY FUN AND ENTERTAiNiNG, LOVE ALL THE SPACE.. THE CAMERA&ViDEO; iS FUN..iT WAS A GREAT CHRiSTMAS GiFT, i LOVE IT!
4	1293840000	Overall I am satisfied with the purchase of the 4th generation iPod (8GB); however, upon comparing it to my nephew's 3rd generation the screen is noticeably smaller.  I didn't check the dimensions at purchase, but just ASSUMED it would be bigger considering it was the latest and greatest iPod.  I guess I assumed wrong.  Also, as others have mentioned, the camera quality is poor and I hope its improved the next go-round.  Again, I do like the product, but would prefer the larger screen with the newer model and a better camera.
5	1293840000	My daughter can text and show me where she's at with the i-pod she watch's movie's and she loves it,there's more to this i-pod but to much to write.Thanks for a nice ..cool i-pod my kids are real happy!!
5	1293840000	I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE AND DELIVERY WAS FAST. AMAZON WAS THE BEST PRICE AND WITH FAST FREE DELIVERY THE BEST DEAL.  I WOULD USE AMAZON AGAIN.
5	1293840000	I like it very much, i use it to listen to my music, chat with friends, facetime, video chat on messenger, play games, watch TV, listen to radio stations, emails, take pics, and look up anything online.its like my little PC.I still use my PC, but this one is much smaller and more practical.
5	1293840000	Amazing product.  Bought this for my 12 year old for Christmas.  She originally wanted a mini lap top.  She got this instead and hasn't put it down since she got it!  Face chat is a great innovation and she has been chatting with her frends that moved away across the USA.  She has been playing games, taking pics and personalizing her ipod Touch. She has been checking her facebook constantly, Checking and sending e-mail...oh and listening to music!  Everything works with speed and is very intuitive.  No difficult learning curve.  The biggest problem we are having is the constant issue with having to re-charge because she uses it so much.  Just once the whole system froze, I simply went on line followed the instructions and within 15 seconds she was good to go all over again.  A great high quality product.
5	1293753600	Bought this for my teenage daughter for Christmas.  Does everything except phone!  Many apps available and many are free.  Seems easy to use and she loves it!
5	1293753600	I gave my teenage boys this iPod at Christmas, and since Christmas they have not been able to put them down.Great purchase. Great price, lowest I found, and I searched many, many websites.Thank you Amazon for your great service.
5	1293753600	I am a huge fan of all of the Apple iPods and iPhones.  I upgraded my 9 year old daughter's Touch 2g to this version (4g).  She was taking pictures and videos within minutes.  We also set up FaceTime to make video phone calls.  When using it within my house (through my router), conversations were instant.  However, going through the internet was a bit sluggish.  I am not sure if it was her friend's internet connection, my connection or whether it was an issue with video via the internet on the Touch.  We primarily upgraded her touch for the photos and video.  In my opinion, it was worth the upgrade.
5	1293753600	If you don't have an iPod Touch... this is a great one to get started with!  I purchased two of these for my sons this Christmas.  They can't put them down.  It was like buying them an MP3 player, gaming system, and a mini computer all in one.  With all the apps from the iTunes... the uses are endless!  I'm thinking about getting two more for MOM and DAD!
4	1293753600	The 4th generation I Pod touch is everything a teenager could ever want.  Two cameras and good video, all the games they want to play, skype and all the social networks, apps galore, and everything that I Tunes has to offer.  Just be sure to say goodbye for the new year...although now my son can watch the football game upstairs without constantly running downstairs every ten minutes to his desktop to facebook.The price was the best on the internet, the shipping was prompt, and amazon delivered again.
5	1293753600	With the 4G, 8 GB Touch, you get most of the functionality of the latest iPhone for without the high price tag or exorbitant data plan.  That's why I bought this particular model and haven't been disappointed.  I spend most of my time inside Wi-Fi range so I hardly even notice the lack of cellular connection.Actually, there is one thing you'll notice: there's no GPS or cell tower triangulation, so it can only tell the approximate location of Wi-Fi network you're on.  That's not good enough for driving or running/exercise apps that track your location and speed.  But as far as I can tell, that's the only class of iPhone apps that don't work perfectly on the Touch.The camera isn't anywhere near as bad as I was led to expect and I've been able to take lots of great photos and videos of my son and send them off to family and friends.The smallest (8GB) one is the best deal if you'll mostly be using apps and books: but if you have an existing music collection or will be taking lots of photos you may want to spring for more storage: Taking pictures/videos for a couple hours at a party will clock up a couple gigs of images, and 30 albums will fill up half the available space.The built in speaker is poor: headphones are a must to enjoy music and helpful for TV and games.
4	1293753600	I upgraded from a 2nd gen Nano to the 8gb 4th gen Ipod touch and it is fabulous!  I love playing the games (apps).  I got it on a great deal at Amazon too.  Worth it.  My husband can't leave it alone either.Wish the battery lasted a little longer and the keyboard was a little different but overall it is fun and easy to use and the music sounds great!  I have not used a lot of the features yet but it seems like fun.  A mini Ipad.
5	1293753600	For me 8gb isn't enough. You want movies? Don't even think about it. Go with 32 or 64. Other than that it blew me away. Five stars even with this. Still usable though. Just not much extra room.
5	1293753600	I think the ipod should have had a way to find your friends over the internet on the facetime app. Also have the ipods start from 16 to 32 to 64g so there is more room for songs and apps.
5	1293753600	My daughter received the Ipod Touch 4G for Christmas and has been using it non-stop.  She loves it!  No problems thus far, but it does seem she has to charge it quite a bit.
5	1293753600	I upgraded from a 8GB 2nd gen iPod Touch to this 8GB 4th gen iPod Touch.PROSRetina Display:Amazingly crisp text and graphics, buttery smooth and sweet for reading even the tiniest text! Better than I imagined. One example: The contacts app icon has tabs on the right side. Never before had I known there were actual letters on each tab (as in a real contacts book), but now I know because I can see them and read them! Insane and good. Reading email and Facebook is way better. So clean and crisp and clear. It's especially noticeable when you look at the 2G and 4G devices side-by-side. Going back to the 2G is just not good. It looks like everything is behind a hazy fog. This is not hyperbole! It's that good. You may get used to it and may need to stop and just gaze at it to appreciate it, but so far it's just great. Each time I open the internet, the graphics, even the small ones, are now discernable!HD video recording and editing and uploading:Superb, excellent, just what I wanted: Simple, elegant, powerful, stunningly and delightfully so. I am now able to shoot HD video anywhere as it happens (I've already tried this), edit with the built in trimming feature (and iMovie which I also purchased from the App Store), and upload directly to both YouTube (via built-in share button) and Facebook (via free Facebook app). It's great!! The quality on YouTube and Facebook are "good enough" after some compression, yet both sites say it's in HD, and indeed it will run in HD full screen, but you can tell it is compressed, meaning it may be 720p resolution, but the bit rate may be lower.) But I love how it's plenty good enough quality to share moments, and how amazingly simple and fast it is to shoot, edit, and upload without a computer, a sync cable, a memory card swap, etc. It's so convenient and easy.I was able to upload two 1-minute HD videos directly to Facebook. They were not made edited in the iMovie app. Later, I was not able to upload a 5-minute HD video directly to Facebook after 3 attempts, but I was able to upload it directly to YouTube no problem, and it looks really good there! Don't know yet if there is a file size limit to video uploads to Facebook. My video was about 100MB compressed I think.There were a few surprises that I really liked, like tapping and holding over the time-line in the built-in playback for video causing the time-line to expand so that you get more accurate pinpointing of video as you slide the marker, or "scrub" it. There are more little things like this that just shine and make Apple products to me just that much better. It's the details.Photos:Photos can be plenty good enough for most casual situations, snapshots, fun shots, etc. It's usable enough to be glad you have when you want it or need it. And some photos turn out better than others. The more lighting the better of course. Outdoor shots are good. Indoor are passable. I love photography and typically use a Canon S5 IS.I found some touch stuff using the iPod Touch camera outdoors in full sun. It's super hard to see the highly reflective screen to just compose your shots and see what you got. And, the device is so thin, it's hard to figure out exactly how to hold it safely. I am not used to it yet and had to be careful to not cover the lens with a finger. It's usually a two-handed affair in landscape to get shots as there is no physical shutter button and it's hard to hold without dropping. Portrait is easier as it's one-handed holding usually.Still, I was able to enjoy it and get some decent shots. The convenience otherwise is great, and the front camera for self-portraits is fantastic! It's so great to see your shot as you take it of you and someone next to you.FaceTime:This feature is not one I had to have, but now that I've used it, I like it a lot. It worked so easily and flawlessly, the video quality was excellent, the audio quality was excellent too. I FaceTimed a friend on their iPod Touch 4G first, then on their MacBook. It was the same excellence and simplicity. I made a FaceTime call and received a FaceTIme call. It's awesome, and I want ALL my family to get FaceTime devices! It's better than Skype on a PC because it's simpler and I really felt closer and more intimate with my caller just because I was holding them in my hand, anywhere I wanted to be. It's awesome.Speaker grill:The speaker now has an external grill. Yes, it is definitely louder and clearer. Enough so that I can hear the audio from a video playing while riding in the car down the freeway at 70mph. No kidding! I was surprised. I even turned it down and could still hear it at half-volume. Excellent.CONSThinner than ever:For my adult hands, this new iPod Touch 4g is thinner than the 2g. I find it to be TOO thin for my taste! Great in the pocket, but holding it for a while and trying to shoot video, you want something a little more grippy and less slippy. It's slippy because it's so light and thin, and the edges can feel sharp in your hand after a while. I think I'll be getting a case for this to add bulk so it feels better and is easier to hold! I never got a case for my 2g and had it for a full two years. It's size and shape was better to me.The one upside of this con, the new shape, is that the back is flat, so it doesn't wobble on a flat surface when tapping around. That is much welcomed. I like that a lot.8GB enough space?I was really wanting 16GB, but since they don't make it, 32GB.So far, I can easily say that 8Gb is indeed enough room. Everyone uses these things differently. You can figure out ahead of time how much space you'll need. I wanted more than 8GB, but I knew 8GB would be enough. Look at it this way, what can the 32GB functionally do that the 8GB cannot? Nothing. They have the same features and thus benefits.I don't see, with the amount of video I've used so far, ever running low on space due to HD video recording. Maybe on an all-day outing without access to wi-fi or a computer to offload the video (which is a simple cut/paste in Windows 7) I don't carry more than a few hundred songs (at the lower 128kbps).I spent a whole afternoon at a zoo and was able to record enough footage in HD to make a 5-minute movie. I don't have much else on my iPod Touch though, which helps a lot.Hope it helps. I'de recommend anyone upgrading from any previous gen iPod Touch.
5	1293753600	It is perfect. After I bought this I stopped using my laptop.Only think I hate its battery. I am using it very much so battery finishes every day.
4	1293753600	I bought one of these for both my kids for Xmas (ages 15yrs & 11, almost 12yrs).  They are having a ton of fun with it.  There is so much to explore and plenty of free applications to play around with, not to mention all the music it can store.  Way better than either of the two versions they previously had.Well worth the money.  My daughter wanted an I-phone, but I talked her out of it.  We'll stick with the cheapo Tracfone, and use the Ipod for all the other cool benefits it has to offer.  You can even skype with it, check online items if you're in a wi-fi area, on and on...
4	1293753600	This iPod is a beauty, love the look, the screen resolution, the apps etc. I even find myself reading a book on it, which I never thought I would do because I like a bigger screen for that like my iPad. But since I have the iPod with me at all times and the iPad stays home a lot it is nice to be able to plow thru a chapter when I stop someplace for lunch.My one complaint is the video function. Works well for objects that are fairly stationary and fairly close. But if you try to film say Xmas lights on houses from the sidewalk you will be disappointed at the micro images. And the editing function is so tiny it is near impossible to trim your video at just the right place, unless your fingers are the size of strands of spaghetti.I lied, my second complaint is that the touch screen is far less responsive than the iPad's. Sometimes you kind of have to poke at it to get it to respond. Where the iPad requires the barest of touches the iPod seems to need a firmer hand.I'm very glad I have it but had higher hopes for the video function as I don't want to buy a Flip or a camcorder.
5	1293753600	I bought this with the intention of using it strictly for travel, but after playing with it I fell in love! I love to play games on it and since it has internet, I no longer use my laptop. My only complaints are that I wish the battery would last longer, after all the stuff that was added on at the factory that you can't delete you actually have less GB than it states, the part where you plug the usb into the ipod looks super sensitive and I always get scared plugging it in, and I wish you could find covers that had built in screen protectors. I still wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. I've owned other MP3 players before and this was definitely the best and easiest to use out of all of them.
1	1293753600	Did not receive this item on time, I ordered it the middle of November expecting it by the first of the month. I am very disappointed and will not order again from Amazon for Christmas presents.
5	1293753600	This is an awesome little product.  It is actually helping my boys to organize their lives, a nice little surprise!  Because it is so fun, they are actually taking advantage of the calendar, calculator, etc!!!
5	1293753600	I got this for my teenage daughter.  It is one of the coolest tech toys I've ever seen.  The things it can do are simply amazing.  She can even make calls on it using a downloadable app.  Pretty amazing...especially when you consider the more expensive iphone is basically the same device, but with a phone feature that many users have trouble with.  I'm seriously considering getting one of these for myself just because the thing is so much fun!
5	1293753600	I got the iPod Touch to stay in contact with my Son. While I'm currently in Japan it seemed that the face time feature would make communication better and more fun. Well I can tell you that I was blown away when I had my first chat with my boy in the states. The reversible camera is a great feature to show your environment, I recently took the family on a ski trip and gave him a call taking advantage of the free WiFi provided at the ski lodge and I was able to go outside and show my son the mountain that we were skiing on in Japan while he was in the states. All the other bells and whistles are nice but I'm sold on Face time.
5	1293753600	Excellent product. Arrived in perfect condition and in 2 days as promised...before Christmas. The gift was for my 20 year old son who is an engineering major and he is very pleased with it.
5	1293667200	I bought this for my daughter.  I don't know how it works but it gives me much peace and quiet for the past two weeks.  Thanks Apple.
5	1293667200	Very good product. Fun to learn & play with. Great to have so many apps, email, FaceBook etc. with me always.
5	1293667200	Can't say that I have personally used this product, but judging from how much time my daughter spends with the ipod touch, I'd say it's a success.  From music to games to chatting to...  well you get the picture.  Great Product!
4	1293667200	I got both of my kids one for Christmas, they are crazy about them. They each had a melt down at different times because the itouch blacked out completely and would not turn on.I asked around to a couple of friends who reported that is common and to check the manual or call Apple and find out how to reset it. My daughter called , and they said that it happens all the time, and told her how to reset it. Kind of wierd.
2	1293667200	Well so I received the iPod and I LOVED it.Yes all the apps and facetime and camera stuff were interesting and easy to use and I fell in love.But today, on the 30th day after I received it, it died all of a sudden.One moment it was working perfectly and the next I couldn't turn it on no matter what I did.The battery was fully charged.And it didn't turn on after I connected to the computer/itunes.Luckily I still could return because of Amazon's awesome policy. What if it died after my warranty expired?Apple is fun. But the quality is really crappy.
5	1293667200	I bought three of these for my 3 kids for Christmas.. they are the neatest things ever... the facetime is so cool.. The battery life is great.. All features are top notch.. I would recommend this item to anyone... Love it Love it Love it.
5	1293667200	I never thought the 4th generation would be much better than the 3rd gen until I bought two!! thats right I loved it so much I bought two of them...awesome HD video, amazing apps, and I love itunes...this order was actually one I ordered for someone else..I have had the other two for almost 2 weeks with no problems/issues
4	1293667200	I ordered this product on Christmas day, as a gift from my father. I received it on Dec 29 and fell in love with it! It's so much fun, lightening fast and crystal clear. My only complaint is that after uploading about 200 songs (my entire collection) and the movie 'The Proposal' onto it, it only had a 2.8 GB capacity left... so that's kind of a bummer, but I did order the 8 GB model, so it's partly my fault. However, after using it for only a day, the unit died. I had just literally sat it down about an hour prior and went to pick it back up to check my e-mail, and the ipod  wouldn't turn on. I plugged it into my computer, and my computer wouldn't read it. Very disheartening! On the upside, Amazon has phenomenal customer service and already has a replacement being shipped out with 1 day shipping. I highly recommend buying all your appliances from Amazon, I buy EVERYTHING from here and they haven't ever let me down!
5	1293667200	I love this itouch I got for Christmas!! It's awesome. The screen is truly awesome! It's very clear. I enjoy watching movies in bed with my Itouch so much. Thanks for the great product!
4	1293667200	Hi all,Great product as all apple products.Pros: It is a light MP3 player with a nice screen that let use several free (or paid applications)Cons 8 Gb is not a lot  anymore.Complaints, less than 10 hours after a bought Amazon has included a 25 dollars gift card in a bundle by the same price a paid.
1	1293580800	Camera is Horrible!!Apple does not tell you that the camera is less than one megapixel!!if you blow the image/video up on your computer it is horrible!!! Thumbs down!!
5	1293580800	my new ipod was delivered in just two days..... and the new 4rth generation is amazing thank you so much amazon, I will definately be back for more:)
5	1293580800	This item is a must have- it has a camera that takes excellent photos and does so many things that a regular ipod does not do. We love this purchase and it was the best one I made out of all the Christmas purchases.
5	1293580800	The apple ipod touch 8GB 4 generation (newest model) is sooooo wonderful! It comes w/camera n video capabilities!!!! Wish i had known that before purchasing. Outstanding. Will purchase another.
5	1293580800	I'm not into tons of digital video but bought this first for business reasons.  I have found the medical software I like runs great on this even when offline.  I also appreciate having frequent web access without having to pay $30-40/month for 3/4G access if I had bought the iPhone in it's place.  It is also smaller than the iPhone.  I have found more free Wifi than I realized was out there.  I heard about free internet at McDonalds, Starbucks, most hotels, Pannera but I had no idea I would even find free Wifi at places like Sam's Club.  So it may be a while before I pay for a web enabled phone.Graphics are great.  The biggest issues I have are with my internet speed at home but not with the device itself.  I'm very much enjoying mine.
5	1293580800	Got this for my daughter and she hasn't picked up her phone again since.Basically an iPhone without the phone. She can text, listen to Internet radio, watch Netflix, and make calls with Google voice (when using WiFi).  I might have to buy myself one of these.I got the 8 GB for her, but after adding a few apps, I realize there might not be much space left for many movies or songs. Highly recommend the 32GB. She listens to Pandora and watches Netflix so this shouldn't be an issue for her.She loves it even after a few months.
5	1293580800	I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loved it!! This one looks much thinner than the last couple of generation and has a built in camera. Overall, it was a great present and well worth the money spent :)
4	1293580800	Works like it should./rant on. I hate dealing with the Apple store and it's invasive programs on my PC. It still fails to find all songs but thats not the Ipods fault. It would be nice to be able to explore the HD like other mp3 players but again, thats Apple for ya. The "8gig = 7.1gig" thing still bugs me a bit but until somebody forces truth in advertising like flatscreen "visible screen" sizes I'll just have to deal. /rant off.Would have spent more on 16gig if I knew how fun all the MANY apps were. Lots of free apps as well. All in all a good buy.
1	1293580800	I can't even review this iPod because I couldn't even use it. My Mac is only 3 years old with Tiger OS 10.4 and it is not compatible with the 4th generation iPod Touch. They expect you to spend an extra [...] to uprade to Snow Leopard. Not gonna happen, so it's going back. I'll stay with my trusted 3rd generation iTouch.
4	1293580800	The iPod is a nifty device with great versatility, but mine is limited by a battery life that is shorter than Verne Troyer.  There have been several days when the iPod is without battery after only 3 hours.  BTW - 8 GB is sufficient, but my media-hungry children probably require more memory.
5	1293580800	I received the i pod touch for Christmas and it was the best present ever.  It does everything except make phones calls.  I can not complain.  Love it!
4	1293494400	This I-pod is pretty amazing. Every thing on it works great. It has new features like the camera and the higher display. Its an I-pod touch...The only thing I don't like about it is the thinness of the unit. I know, that's the whole goal these days is to make it smaller but it seems too thin. Its hard to sit it in the palm of your hand without it wanting to slip away. I will take care of that by putting it in a good thick case. That is the ONLY complaint I have with this I-pod, other than the size of the hard drive which was my decision. This I-pod blows my gen 1 touch out of the water. Speaker, volume control, multitasking...the list goes on and on.
4	1293494400	I got this for my son and he loves it.  He's loaded a couple of games and some tunes on it.  We also added the geocaching app. He's enjoying it and there are no game cartridges to lose like for his Nintendo DS.  The only thing I didn't like was that there was no wall charger included.  It only has a USB cable that you can plug into certain chargers or into the computer.  The case is slick, so we will be getting a screen protector and case ASAP.
4	1293494400	This was purchased for our 17 y/o son. So far he has not left it alone since opening it Christmas morning. Mom has had to remind him to put it down and sleep, eat, shower. It's really his and we have not yet been allowed to touch it so we can't rate it. However, there have been much "cooool" and "hehehehe" and squeeling like a little girl so we believe the product has met it expectations.
5	1293494400	My son loves it!  He's already packed it with games and still has plenty of room left for music and videos.  Now I can have my iPhone back!
5	1293494400	This new iPod touch is awesome, it takes pictures and video and has face time to video chat with your friends. It has so many features!
5	1293494400	This was a gift for my daughter... she (and I) love it!!  Its so much fun... So glad I got it for her.. Oh and did I mention I got it almost 25.00 cheaper on Amazon than at any store!
5	1293494400	Amazon shiped this item so fast that i can't belive it was my order when i found the box outside my door
5	1293494400	This Apple Ipod Touch 4th Generation is the greatest electronic ever!  It works great and it looks great!  The apps on the device are the best and the capabilities are plentiful.  Everyone should have one!
5	1293494400	Awesome!  Bought this for my 15 year old daughter, downloaded a parental control app for $5 and now we can both enjoy.  I can relax knowing she's protected and she can enjoy her new Ipod!
5	1293494400	First let's get the irritation out of the way. The stated capacity of this iPod Touch is 8GB. Does that mean you will have 8GB to use and fill it to your heart's content? No. The actual capacity you have load up of is 6.46GB. No doubt the difference is consumed by the operating system, but it should be stated in a footnote. The difference is substantial. Would you buy a pound of cookies only to find they included the weight of the package and you only got 13 ounces of cookies? Apple needs to address this issue: it is like the difference between gross weight and net weight.As for the iPod Touch, it has exceeded my expectations. There is nothing else like in the market (although it is rumored that Samsung will release a competing product next year). I own both the Nokia N800 and N810 internet tablets which are well-built and solid. Only geeks should buy them. The touch screen on each is relatively slow to respond, there are few applications and installing them is painful.The Touch, however, is in another class entirely, sleek and elegant, all glass and steel. Thin (almost too thin to get a good grip on, so I bought a silicone case for it on that big auction site for less than a dollar, with free shipping). And the screen. The screen has to be seen to be believed. You cannot see individual pixels. Even the smallest print is razor sharp at a normal viewing distance of a foot or less. Apple calls the screen Retina Display. I call it Awesome.With the Touch, Apple has brought the concept of user friendly to a new level. Within minutes of opening the plastic jewel box, you will be using the Touch like an old pro. The learning curve is close to zero.Now, any handheld device is only as good as what you can use it for, and the uses for the Touch are limitless, thanks to over 300,000 apps. I did a count of what is free and I came up with 83,000 apps of all kinds, from productivity to games to books. No matter what your interest, you are likely to find the apps you want.My suggestion? Buy it, although, in the long run you might be happier with a model with larger capacity, but there is a tradeoff: the larger ones cost a lot more.Speaking of cost, I have special praise for Amazon. Days after I bought my Touch on Black Friday, Amazon slightly increased the selling price but threw in a $25 gift card. I contacted Amazon, hoping for a price adjustment, reflecting a portion of the value of the gift card. Amazon wrote back, crediting my account the full value of the card. Needless to say, I was both surprised and pleased. I have always been satisfied with Amazon's service, but this time it was exceptional.Thank you, Amazon.
5	1293494400	Purchased for my daughter for Christmas and she has not put it down.  It does everything the IPhone does without the phone.
4	1293494400	I bought the iTouch as a Xmas gift for my mum. She loves it! The only downside is the capacity. This is our first iPod purchase, so we didn't understand that we would not get the entire 8 gigabytes. I think it's false advertising. You only get 7 gigabytes of space. Wish I had bought a larger capacity for my mum. She loves to play games and watch movies. I bought her "The Mighty Sparrow" album and every time she listens to him, she says, "Now that is calypso!" :)We also love the dual cameras. The pics are crisp and clear.  My sister has a 3G iPhone and she's blown away by all the added features on the 4G touch. I hope to one day buy an iPhone when my wireless contract expires.
4	1293494400	I brought this Ipod-Touch on Thanksgiving Deal @ Amazon and till now it has been a excellent deal. This is my first IPOD and first Apple gadget so I am all excited. I would expect Apple to ship a standard socket charger with ipod's so that you don't need always have your laptop or a USB based devices powered ON for charging.Its a Apple gadget so no comments on tech.
5	1293494400	I received the Ipod Touch within 3 days and it was the best price available during the Black Friday - Cyber Monday sales plus free shipping!
5	1293494400	The Ipod Touch Screen was new and the information that was given was correct. I would recomend this item to anyone.
5	1293494400	I purchased this for my husband for Christmas so he could be one of the "cool kids" with our daughter and myself and now he is the coolest of us all - his ipod has a camera.  We spend all of Christmas day shooting mini videos of everyone and had a blast reviewing them later!  Works great and he is amazed at the battery life!
5	1293494400	Very pleased with purchase.  Would recommend ordering 32G.  8 GB fills up fast.  Best gift have gotten in long time.
5	1293494400	This is the 3rd Ipod touch that I have owned and this is my favorite. The battery life is amazing, the graphics are great, and the apps make my life so much easier. I recommend this for anyone. I love using it to check my email on the go, checking the weather, and keeping my life organized. This is definitely worth the money!
4	1293494400	This was exactly what I expected. I onlygave it 4 stars because it could not be engraved like it is at the Apple Store.
4	1293494400	Awesome iPod but the battery life is awful, I feel like I am charging it more often than playing on it...
1	1293494400	My IPOD Touch one day after I received it, did not start any more. Can you please instruct me on what to do to either have it repaired or replaced?Yours sincerelyMaribel Meneses
5	1293494400	I bought this item for my 11 year old and she hasn't put it down for days. Easy to use, great picture, and tons of apps to choose from to download. Definitely worth the money, she loves it.
4	1293494400	I have the iPhone and was tired of having the kids (7 & 9) ask if they could use it. Now they have their iTouches and are having a blast exploring the various features. Both are figuring out how to use the devices on their own without much help from me. Needless to say they do not have the password for the App Store; I do. =) And I am very thankful for free apps.
5	1293494400	I just got my iPod touch 4 yesterday. I was so excited to have it. I just was checking the price on Amazon today and I figured out that it is $7 more and there is no free gift card. My bargain was an iPod touch 4 for $202 + a free $25 gift card..so you can tell that the price is almost $179. That's great!!! You will never find such an offer anywhere except at Amazon!! Love Amazon!
5	1293494400	Ipod touch works great.  I have many Ipod/Iphone products and all work well.  I should have purchased the 32G touch as this 8G is almost full.
5	1293494400	The kids love it and now my husband wants one.  He loves all the games that can be downloaded for free!  It was a very nice Christmas since I loaded their music to it before Christmas so they listened to them all day.  One thing they didn't like is how short the battery life is and how much they have to charge them up.
5	1293494400	This ipod touch was perfect for my 11 year old daughter.  She has already started putting apps on there and its so user friendly.
1	1293494400	My daughter dropped her new ipod onto a table - about a 12 inch fall it smashed.  We have gotten service for the screen repair and while we were there 3 other people called for the same problem.  I should have paid more attention to the reviews regarding design flaws for the new gen i pods.  If you plan to take this thing anywhere - keep it in the plastic box it came in.
3	1293494400	Very frustrating that it wasn't plug and play. It was locked or stuck in sleep mode, Itunes would not recognize the device, apples troubleshooting procedures didn't work. Had to take it to Best Buy to have them unlock it.
5	1293494400	This product is exactly what I wanted and more.  It was for my 12 year old son for Christmas and he can play games, video chat, check email...it is like a little laptop--He loves it and the battery lasts for a very long time.  You may want to get some itunes giftcards to go with it though--most of the apps cost money.  It is a wonderful little toy/tool and works great.
4	1293494400	My daughter loves her 8 Gig 4th Generation i-Touch  we bought her for Christmas 2010. She can't put it down
5	1293408000	The Apple iPod touch NEWEST MODEL I've bought for my daughter is really awesome! We like the design, pure and bright colors of screen, the quality of sound and the possibilities!We can see e-mails, browse web-sites, find music, make and save pictures of great quality. Huge capacities!We just can not take off the eyes from this modern thing!
1	1293408000	The product is good i know even though i have not received it but the assurance is not good because when i got it, it was only box nothing was inside. Something will be done by me if i don't get my product that I paid for.
4	1293408000	The only thing I didn't like about this product was the USB cable supplied with the unit. In particular, the end that plugs into the bottom of the Ipod. At first glance, it appeared not fit. Then it was realized that we had to squeeze the tiny pins in to attach to the Ipod. What a pain. The cable that came in the accessory pack I purchased was MUCH easier with two buttons on either side of the plug itself. Other than that, my eleven-year-old is thoroughly enjoying it!
5	1293408000	Purchased the iPods on Thanksgiving day on sale then they were further reduced on Black Friday.  Amazon refused to price match against their own new pricing!  I spent over an hour on the phone; don't appreciate the horrible customer service I received.  Now don't get me wrong the product is great; nephew and niece love their new Chrimst gift.  But I may never purchase anymore items from Amazon.
5	1293408000	My teen child has loved this Christmas gift.  Easy to use.  Would be happier if it came with wall charger, but we can purchase one.
5	1293408000	I bought the iPod touch 8GB for my nephew's 14th birthday and he hasn't put it down since.  I purchased the iPod touch 32GB a little over a year ago and am jealous of all of the new features in this new 4G verson.
4	1293408000	Bought for the kids instead of a DSi as there are many game options and most are free or only a few dollars (instead of $30-40 each).  The kids love playing games on it and even watching Netflix.
4	1293408000	First I want to say Amazon ROCKS! My original order was lost and as this was a gift for my son on Christmas I was a bit perturbed but Amazon made it right by 1 day shipping a replacement. I have no idea what happened to the other unit as it hasn't shown up yet and in the hundreds of purchases here have never had anything lost prior to this.The iPod Touch was a wonderful Christmas gift for my son (age 16. He is very happy with it, the look of surprise on his face when he unwrapped it was priceless. He hasn't put it down in days except to charge, which by the way, he tells me is about a day and a half of playing.I haven't spent too much time with it myself so can't offer much more than that and there's no place to give ffedback on the excellent customer service that Amazon gives so here it is.
5	1293408000	We bought 2 Ipod touches for our kids for birthdays. They love them and we have had no problems with them.
5	1293408000	i'm new with the whole ipod thing, I haven't bought one but I am looking to buy a tmobile iphone 4g phone. I don't get whether if this is a phone or just a music player?
5	1293408000	Bought this for my son and ended up asking Santa for one for me! Lots of stuff to do on it. Internet has to be on in order to get a lot of the apps we have ie: GPS and yellow pages. But even without wi-fi you can still use it for many things ie: games and camera. You will want to get a case and screen protector as they smudge quite easily. With 2 of them in the house, we needed to make an appointment at the Apple store. Friendly, courteous help.
4	1293321600	People say it's the "iPhone without the phone."  While this claim is somewhat of an overstatement, it IS an excellent buy.  It's different than a phone in the sense that you can't call or text (obviously) although you can Face Time, it uses WiFi instead of a network (which can be awesome if you have WiFi readily available, but a pain in the butt if you don't), the still cameras have less than one mega pixel, and it has far less ram than an iPhone 4.Other than that, I really can't complain!  It holds all of my music with lots of room to spare (yes, the 8gb!), has a slideshow function for pictures, takes and plays sweet videos, the browser is AMAAAAZING, the apps are TO DIE FOR, and the Retina Display is crystal clear.  Makes me feel rich just holding it. Lol.  I LOOOOVE it, it's everything you could ever ask for in an mp3 player... or small computer, as would be a more accurate name for it. =)If you know anyone who has one, play around with theirs (ask first!) before you buy.  Some people just don't need all the extra "fluff" like apps, web browser, Face Time, etc. and getting a Classic, Nano, or other mp3 player would be a better investment for them.  So "choose wisely!" =)  Visit an Apple store and play around with the different models, and shop around to see if you like any other brands.  BTW... my sis got the Android version of this and it doesn't even compare... the iPod Touch wins!!
5	1293321600	Bought this for my daughter and she hasn't put it down since, and when she does I usually pick it up myself. I was amazed with the apps on the device and the ones we purchased. I love the facetime feature, talking with someone face to face is really cool. The battery life seems to be the only thing that I would like to see improve, but we do play games and surf the web alot, which may contribute to the problem. I will probably be purchasing another one soon.
5	1293321600	this is an awesome apple ipod-the 8gb is great-i was kinda wanting one myself and im 29 lol...but anways its well worth the money!!!..
5	1293235200	The 4th generation IPod touch is a great device for listening to a music library, streaming live music over WiFi, checking email, recording photos, and monitoring events with apps.  The multi-tasking ability is a major improvement in the design.  If you are a gym rat, this is the device to keep you entertained during your workout, if you enjoy quiet time with coffee, this is the device to use while waiting for your friends.  Need to check the weather forecast, this is it.  Get it.  Enjoy it.
5	1293235200	Incredible Service - Fast - Priced Right - Shipped Fast! Will order from them again!!!Order arrived in 1 day - Just in time for Christmas - I couldn't believe it.Apple 8GB with 2 Cameras is awesome and works faster than previous models - It's a must have!
5	1293235200	I've had my old iPod Touch for about 3 years now, and I absolutely love it. I've used it so much that my battery life isn't that great anymore, and it's a little scratched. I made the decision to purchase the newest model of the iPod Touch today, and I'm so thrilled to be receiving it in the next couple of days. If you're thinking about buying this product, I definitely suggest that you do. It does so much for my life with Apps, and it's just plain fantastic! I love it!
5	1293235200	My 13 year old sister received this for her Christmas gift as well as all her friends. She loves it! Hasn't put it down since she opened it. I messed with it for a little while to get it set up for her and it's a neat little thing.*Update*: I ended up ordering one of these for myself. Lol. :) My I-pod Nano quit working a few years ago and I haven't had any type of music player since. I have definitely missed music on the go!! This little electronic device is amazing! You can connect to the internet, download all sorts of apps, listen to music, watch videos, etc. Both my sister and I use ours a lot! It is well worth the money in my opinion. Only problem I have noticed is that it takes forever to get it fully charged on my computer. Even with half battery left, it still takes about an hour or more to get it fully charged. Plus, if you use it as much as my sister and I use our I-pods, the battery dies quickly. If I discover any more pros or cons later, I will update again. :)
5	1293148800	I bought this iPod for my kids cause they loved my iPod 32 4th gen they have a blast playing with mine so much I bought the 8gb 4th gen for Xmas so for once I can enjoy my iPod
4	1293148800	Yet another time apple has proved itself by producing one of the finest gadgets of 2010.Sleek design,light weight,Retina Disply and even  front and back facing camera.The only Drawback is that is is super thin and that increases the possibility of being dropped from the hands....Yet to Discover more out of this device.....FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER FOR MORE GADGET UPDATES[...]FOLLOW ME ON YOUTUBE FOR MORE GADGET VIDEOS AND UPDATES[...]
1	1293062400	This item (and all other new apple products) does not work on Tiger.It works great with Windows XP, which is from 2001. But not Tiger, which first hit shelves in 2005. I've asked Apple reps for justification of this and no one has been able to give any.  Apple is simply coercing Apple customers into buying new Apple software they don't need while allowing PC users a free pass because they know they can't squeeze more money out of them.As Apple gets bigger it gets greedier and it will only get worse.I got this iPod as a gift for a friend who is still running Tiger.  He can't use it.  So I tried to give him my old iPod Touch, which worked fine on Tiger but has since been upgraded to Leopard.  When I contacted Apple to downgrade the software to use it again with Tiger, they said it's Apple policy not to help me.  When I tried to do it myself, I found out that Apple has put a block on downgrading your software to earlier versions.I have bought Apple products for a long time.  It's insane to me that a $1300 iBook from 2005 which is in perfect working condition can no longer work with Apple products.  At the Apple store they'll tell you that their computers are supposed to last five years, but they won't tell you that Apple will essentially force you to buy a new one in five years.  And that lifespan will only get shorter.Apple needs some competition -- it needs another company making products specifically for macs.  And preferably one with the same central mission that Apple had in the beginning--to make sleek, intuitive products that focus on art and creativity.  The products are still as great as ever but the mission has become purely for profit.  I have no doubt Apple's good name will go bad very soon.
5	1293062400	This little gadget will do everything but serve you breakfast in bread. And I'm sure someone somewhere is working on an app for that.I've been holding off on buying an Apple iOS device because, to be honest, my dumb phone and my old iPod were working perfectly fine and serving their purpose. I used to be an early adopter . . . but I became crazy about motorcycles, so I now tend to only buy the gadgets that I think I need. And I didn't think I really *needed* an iPhone or an iPod Touch, compared to how urgently I *needed* some new chrome part for my bike. So, I waited. I waited, knowing when I finally purchased an iOS device that I'd ask myself, "Why did I wait so long?"I picked up my 8 GB iPod Touch during Amazon's Black Friday Sale. It came with a $25 gift card, making the price effectively $175! At that price, I had no more excuses to hold off. And now I ask myself, why did I wait so long. XDOf course, I'd played with friends' iPhones, iPods, and iPads, but until I got one of my own that I use every day and have set up with the apps I want, I was missing out on part of the experience. Also, before it arrived, I was sure I was going to jailbreak it. Now I don't know why I should bother. Maybe at some point I'll feel the need to jailbreak my iPod, and I'm glad to know the option is there (you rock, jailbreak developers!), but right now the iPod is doing everything I want (except serve me breakfast in bed).
5	1292976000	This is amazing.  I ordered it for my wife and we love it!!!!!  I have an android phone and love that as well but this device makes me rethink efficiency.  Sooooo many apps, sooooo many features.  Amazon has great deals and this was priced better then anywhere else.  I am glad I waited until the 4th generation, retna display is amazing, its awesome to have two cameras, you can even text and make calls on this thing, what a device!!!!!
5	1292976000	I like it a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTnothing to envy Iphone4 excep making voice call. but who cares i have FACETIME LOLi recomend this intem to all people who doesnt want a netbook.love lots app
5	1292976000	It's cool. It's great fun to use it. It's sheer pleasure to own it. :)All the apps, features work flawlessly. 8GB was enough, because I wasn't planning to store long videos on it. Just some videos of animations, rhymes for my kid.No monthly running costs to drain my pocket, which an iPohone would have cost. So this was the best deal.Very happy with it!
5	1292889600	Bought this as a birthday present for my 9 year old granddaughter - wasn't sure if she would be pleased or not, she loves it - she is able to use it with no problems after a little start up advice from her older brother - great gift for any kid - plus it can do so much and it made her feel grownup with her own e-mail -
1	1292889600	i wanted to recieve this most of all for a special grandson gift tracking reveals same info day after day it never changes from 12/11/10. HELP i want this and it's now 12/21/10. order tracking #9102927008963004553021 .
5	1292803200	dear AllI just bought the itouch five days ago, 215 plus 25 GC, but today, the discount is more than before. why? just a few days passed. now, 205 plus 25 gift card.Amazon, Tell me why...regret to buy it now...
4	1292716800	We found this product to be such an imporvment from the older Ipod touch. The Last one we had was a 2nd genetation and it often gave us issues with the touch screen. We finally gave in and got a new one 4th generation and it was the best thing we could have dont. The movie quality is so much better then the 2nd generation. Theover all aplication feature is better.. all in all its so much better then what we had before.
1	1292716800	I bought an iPod Touch for my daughter's Christmas gift. Before I received the order, I found Amazon provide a $25 gift card for the same order. I emailed AMAZON and ask for the same deal. They did not care at all. I guess I have to return the order and re-order it. This is wasting everybody's efforts. I  am not happy at all for this transaction.
1	1292716800	Five Star for Apple Device.  One Star for Amazon Customer Service!Refuse to price match for an order that was less than a week ago and they didn't even ship it until Thursday!  Probably they just don't mind to have few more open box to sell in their warehouse site!
5	1292716800	The new iPod touch is sooooo much more fun than the latest nano I had bought only a few months back! So I sold my nano and bought the new touch iPod, yay!Definitely worth the money :)))
5	1292716800	Everybody knows how great is Ipod Touch 4. I want to state that amazon is my first choice and they never disappoint me! I bought it as a gift for my wife and she loved it.
5	1292630400	I just received my ipod touch today and so far I love it! The only problem I forsee is I may need to get a different sized dock (the white piece that goes on my alarm clock) but that's the only draw back, but it will only set me back about nine bucks. Sound quality w/out earbuds is a bit disappointing but that could just be from user error. I am very pleased with this product. Amazon so rocks!!
5	1292630400	I have three toddlers and they're addicted to iOS devices.Pixar shorts stored on the iPod Touch distract and calm them down when they're crying. The Netflix app works over WiFi and lets them watch streaming video on-demand. The plethora of great-quality kid apps from the App Store let them play memory games, learn animal names, and do puzzles. It's great!The 4th gen iPod Touch takes things up a notch by adding a high-resolution retina display that eliminates aliasing (tiny jagged edges) and looks amazing! It has almost as many pixels as a 42" 720p HDTV, but packs them into a 3.5" screen. It's sharp and clear!It also has a front and back camera and built-in microphone, so it can make Facetime calls to iPhone 4's when connected to WiFi!Also, the "Find My iPhone" app works with the iPod Touch so you can have log into Me.com, click "Send a Message" and have the iPod Touch make a beep for a couple of minutes while you try to find where the kids hid it!The iPod Touch simply dominates the portable media player arena and the newest generation is the best iPod Touch yet!That said, you'll often hear that the iPod Touch is just an iPhone without the "phone", but that really isn't the case. Beyond not being able to make phone calls with an iPod Touch, you also can't use a lot of the more useful apps when you're disconnected from WiFi. The "Yelp!" app can't find nearby restaurants, GPS apps simply don't work and the lack of cellular data means that the apps I use most frequently on my iPhone aren't available to the iPod Touch when I'm on the road.Nevertheless the iPod Touch is a high-quality marvel of modern technology that is absolutely amazing as a music player, portable HD camera, video player, casual game system and even video phone when you're at home.Now we just need to convince Grandma to get something similar so we can put Facetime to good use!
5	1292457600	I just bought this item, and really love it.  I use it everyday just for talking with my girlfriends in Taiwan via facetime.  It's a wonderful product that I believe everyone will love it.  The bad thing is that I only received $15 gift card.  If I know that Amazon will give $25 gift card, I might just buy the 32 GB or wait a little bit longer to buy it.
1	1292457600	I was upset when I received the IPod. I bought this for a gift and it was not boxed. It came in a generic plastic case. It was not encased in a box of any kind. If I had known this was how I would receive the IPod I would have gone to the Apple Store and paid a little more to get a properly boxed gift. I will never buy anything like this from Amazon again.
4	1292371200	Hopefully I can answer some questions you may have about the iPod Touch 4th gen:Q: Should I upgrade to this model from my 3rd or 2nd generation iPod Touch?A: Maybe.  At the same capacity, and no less expensive of a price, owners of 3rd and 2nd generation iPod Touches may want to think twice about the upgrade.  However, if Facetime, a rear facing still and video camera, and a higher resolution display sounds irresistible then make the jump!  The slight change in form factor is not very noticeable.  No groundbreaking features have revolutionized the device from it's previous two iterations and it still retains all of its previous draws like the App Store, the ability to play video and music, etc.Q: Should I upgrade to this model from my 1st generation iPod Touch?A: Yes.Q: How is the build quality?A: Hit and miss.  I purchased a brand new iPod Touch 4th gen and it arrived with a glaring white hot pixel smack in the middle of the screen.  Nothing worked to fix it.  It also had a small sliver of backlight leak around the lower right corner between the glass and the black rubber fillet that secures it in place.  Not a big issue- but noticeable in the dark.  I returned that one and received my new one today.  So far so good - no noticeable stuck or dead pixels.  This one came with the same backlight problem as the other one on all four corners but it is much less noticable and only visible at certain unnatural viewing angles.  No big deal.  I hear it is a common issue for this generation.  There was a small mark on the chrome body right out of the box - but, again, no big deal.  Also (this may just be my eyes) but the retina display on this one does not seem to have the depth of color my first one had.  Perhaps Apple uses multiple panel models for it's displays- which is very possible considering the sheer number of these things that are produced.  Anyway, like all products built through assembly line in mass quantities, there is bound to be some imperfection, even for Apple.  Overall these are minor, nit-picky issues and I couldn't ask for much more in build quality.  It is simple and sturdy.  I dropped my previous 2nd generation iPod Touch face down 4 feet onto solid concrete.  I brushed it off and besides a few small dings on the chrome nothing was wrong! Hopefully that proves to be the case with this generation, too.Q: How's the battery life?A: It's okay.  It drains pretty fast. If you are like me and want to view your Retina Display in it's full glory (meaning on full brightness), the battery leaves some to be desired.  Granted, I have Wifi on all the time, use music, videos, and apps- but, hey, isn't that what this device is meant to do?Q: How's the sound quality?A: I do not work in the music industry and have not sampled many music playback devices, so I cannot give a professional review. However, to my ears, the sound is crisp, clear and true to the original format of the material. Great sound. This is an iPod after all!Q: Is it fun?A: Yes, it is my favorite adult toy.Q: Worst feature?A: Unequivocally MULTITASKING.  Multitasking is a good thing, yes, that's true.  However, Apple has made it function in the most annoying way possible.  After you use a couple of apps and have pressed the Home Button to get back to your home screen- don't be fooled - they are ALL still open! Yes, they are all open and running in the background taking up some (albeit probably a trivial amount) of your battery power and processing speed.  The most inconvenience comes when you have been using an certain apps with sound- specifically ones with music or radio. In this case, you will still hear that app playing even once you have went back to your home screen.  What must be done to close these apps?  You must double-click the home button which will bring up a marquee on the bottom of the screen displaying all of your previously used apps (which are still open).  To close any number of these you must select one, hold your finger down, wait for the wobble and red minimize circle to appear on each app. You then close them, one by one, as if you are deleting apps.  This is not a bad way to handle multitasking - if you wish to use it- BUT Apple does NOT give you the option to turn multitasking off!  So, if you are like me and wish to fully close each app after you've used it, prepare for some inconvenience. Also, I have to mention- the 8gb capacity should have been upped to 16gb in this iteration.  Times are changing and operating systems, apps, and media are demanding more space, so this is not the most forward-thinking capacity standard.Q: Best feature?A: This is hard, as there are so many, but I will say- the Retina Display! Seriously, best display I have ever used, especially on such a small device.  It puts my 2010 Macbook Pro's display to shame- and that display is amazing as it is.  Coverflow on this is PURE eye candy.  I find myself flipping through my album art in Coverflow even when I am not trying to pick music to listen to! And, my favorite part of all- watching full-screen movies with the Retina Display.  It is unbelievable! The movie just flows so smoothly, no lag, and the image is crisp and clean, bright and colorful.  The display is the perfect size- not too small at all! I have watched full feature films on it in bed in the pitch dark and depending on how close you hold it, it can really resemble the movie theater experience (to an extent).  The only thing I could ask for is an invisible force field that hovers the iPod in front of me - because holding it up in bed for a couple of hours is a challenge! : pBuy it, You'll love it and come back to tell me I was right - Enjoy!EDIT: I just discovered ANOTHER WHITE PIXEL on my replacement iPod.  Oh well, I guess I will live with it.  But, beware if you are anal about your products like I am this is an annoyance.
4	1292284800	As mentioned by many previous reviewers, this is another great product from Apple. It has wifi and blue tooth capability, two cameras, microphone and speaker for communication and even a gyroscope 'motion' sensor. I use my iPod for checking email (can setup even MS Exchange emails easily), browsing, checking google maps, keeping contacts, skype, taking pictures and videos (okay quality), transferring files and of course listening to music. You can download a number of apps (free or as cheap as $0.99) either directly using WiFi connection or through iTunes setup in your PC or Mac. The appstore allows you to search for free apps if you like. So, I like all the great offerings that iPod has as an entertainment and productivity tool.The biggest con I haven't seen mentioned in many reviews is... iOS4 (the operating system used in this iPod & iPhone 4G) has multi-tasking capabilities. So applications that you open keep running in the background. There is no 'close' button for apps. Depending on the app, this can drain your battery pretty fast. Only when you turn off your iPod do these apps close.*** So, How to Close Background Apps w/o turning iPod off? ***To close apps, you need to double-click the home button. This would reveal a 'task bar' at the bottom that shows all running apps. If you touch and hold an app, all the apps get a '-' sign on top. touching the '-' sign would close the app. what a round about way to close background apps? Hopefully, apple would put a close button on apps in the next update of iOS.
1	1292112000	Hello,Best buy is offering the same product at $229.99 with a $40.00 best buy gift card.  Will you offer the same deal or must I return the item and purchase from Best Buy?  Thank you.
5	1292025600	My son is having a good time.  He did have a little problem with fully charging the IPOD, but got some tech support and OK now.
5	1291939200	Apple is a company that a lot of others should take a page from, Its a great product that does all it says and more. My 12 Year old loves it ! and I love the fact he now stays off my I Phone. Amazon had the lowest price , and when first one was lost in the mail , a no hassle attitude about re placing the lost one. A lot of companies should take a page from amazon as well.
5	1291852800	It's really a fantastic oneI already have one in 2nd generation, but I still cannot wait to get the 4th generation. The 4th gen has the following advantages:1. the speed is much faster2. the retina screen can give me more fun, when I used the 4th generation for a while, I was not getting used to the 2nd generation3. It has camera, which is irreplaceable4. It can offer Bluetooth and microphone, and I can record my songs with it5. the battery can sustain a longer timeThe only drawback is that when I play with it for a while, it becomes very hot
5	1291766400	I upgraded to the iPod Touch with wifi for one simple reason: to stream Pandora.com to my sound system.Having read numerous reviews about docks not working I was nervous because I already owned a neat little Belkin dock attached to my Harman/Kardon receiver + JBL speakers as well as a Versalife Ladybug that I use in odd places around the house. I wanted great sound from Pandora and I didn't want to have to futz around with adapters or new components.Happy Day! The iPod arrived, I dropped it into the Belkin dock, connected to Pandora via wifi and never looked back. The iPod Touch stands up straight and charges while docked. Both docks I'm using are about 18 months old and neither require an adapter.For what it's worth, 8GBs is plenty for me. Although I have more than 8 GBs of music and Podcasts on my laptop, I doubt that I will even bother loading more than a couple playlists and/or Podcasts from iTunes. Maybe when I'm traveling.This is one sweet little streaming Pandora machine. I'm in love!!!!
5	1291766400	This is a great device -- easy to set up and use.It streams videos in record time.You can download content directly to it using your wi-fi connection or via your PC.We got one for our son for a combo Birthday and Christmas present.
1	1291766400	Got my new IPOD touch, can't get past the first screen.  It won't let me register or anything.  The first screen is frozen.  Guess I need to send it back.What a PAIN!
5	1291680000	I got the Ipod Touch (4g) from Amazon for their special price of $199 on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  Since receiving the device I have been a very happy camper.  The general feature that I really appreciate is the integration of several services in one device.  I am using this hand-held device as a wifi phone, media player, internet device, camera, email, text message, organizer, and general information collection tool.  I am very happy with all of that.I would whole-heartedly agree with other comments here that "the lines between the Ipod Touch and Iphone have blurred with the 4th generation Ipod Touch".  I have a home office and I do not have to travel much, so this works great for me (good bye cell phone carriers and hello to savings!).  I am using the Line2 app for the phone service (which is about $10 per month for virtually unlimited calling and texting).Since it has been commented about so frequently here, I would clarify that this is NOT an Iphone.  You do not get the higher resolution cameras, GPS, and 3GS for a phone connection.  Therefore, some apps do not work with the Ipod (about 2 out of the 50 apps I have downloaded and tried so far on the device).  However, for $200 and no current need for a phone carrier, I can live with those minor differences.  I have generally organized my personal communications around a home Wifi set up (e.g., I also use an Ooma), and that strategy makes the Ipod Touch 4g work well for me.My only warning to those considering buying an Ipod Touch 4g is the screen size.  The imaging is crisp with the retina display.  However, if you are particular about screen size, then spend the extra money and just get an Ipad.
5	1291680000	THe ipod is slimmer and the curves are better, the camera looks extremely small. the box i received it in is like 12x6x3. i ordered a satechi batter pack with it, the box looks big compared to the packaging. the items must of slid around alot, there were no fuzz and only 2 small air bags But the items are great.a new thing is on the oppsite side of the earphone plug there is like a tiny hole for the speaker i think
4	1291680000	this is my first apple product; i finally made the switch over to the ipod mp3 players from the previous no-name brands i clung to.  i'm very happy with this ipod 4th generation, all except for the battery life.  it dies much quicker than i expected to, most usually after only a couple of hours of heavy use.  other than that, top notch!
5	1291593600	I know understand the hype and this makes me want to get the iphone just for the 3g or 4g network. An itouch with 4g network unlimited data plan would be heaven. But since I mostly use this in places that have wifi such as work and office it's good enough.Apps are awesome, this is very convenient as a web browser, mini game player, music player, even has pretty decent speakers. Apps make useability like Pandora infinitely better. You can do a lot with this. Words can't explain. Just try it for yourself.
1	1291593600	The product i got had a lot of scratches, should have purchased it in store. looked like a used item, will be returning it now.
5	1291507200	The new iPod has done something amazing- it's giving families a chance to spend time together. I purchased 2 iPods, one for my daughter in California and one for my son. We use the iPod to save minutes on the cell phone. We have crystal clear reception and we can actually see each other. Using the Facetime application is free, and that's a real plus, when you'd like to see and talk to someone. Additionally, the iPod has ample storage for music and photo downloads. Apple also makes it easy to pick applications for your new iPod.
4	1291420800	It's a great little pocket computer does everything including youtube, I have one complaint I'm questioning on whether or not to exchange but when I first got it the gyroscope wasn't working at all, than suddenly it worked once more but now it is not functioning again, but now as i fiddle with right now it's working once more? I'd hate to have to ship it back and wait 2-3 weeks for a new one to come.Screen Resolution is amazing screen also gets extremely bright.Cameras are descent it's a damn shame the ipod couldn't get the 5mgp camera and led flash, however the camera on the back is still better than my Creative Vado HD which is sad of course it is a 3 year old product so not really comparable, objects look very fuzzy on the Vado but when u use the ipod objects are quite clear for the most part low lighting doesn't work to well.Gyroscope as I was saying seems to work most of the time but occasionally it stops if it continues I will exchange, however it's going to be hard to do so during the Christmas season, take note this does not mean every ipod is going to have this problem it is probably just a defect, I recommend getting gyrosynth it's pretty cool app for the gyroscope.Sound quality isn't so great why?  Well it works, but I have this old Creative Zen X-Fi 8gb player and the sound quality is a million times better through the speaker as well through the headphones which by the way creative actually threw in a 30 dollar pair of headphones which I now use on the ipod retail price on zen 8gb=$100 the zen's sound quality is so much better which is pathetic on apple's part, might I suggest this zen is like 2-3 years old I was hoping apple would have upped the sound quality which didn't seem to increase much...Also the ipod external speaker is mediocre doesn't get very loud and it appears to have little to no bass capabilitiesI think most people would rather wait for the ipad 2nd version to come out than this ipod so it arrives with the new retina display, and cameras for facetime and so much more...It's much more practical for multimedia purposes b/c the screen is so much bigger games and apps are much more easier, funner, and practical than ipod/iphone I've used my brother's ipad which is awesome especially battery, which lasts for a week! no exaggeration! well I guess it depends on how much U use it, which I guess for me would last 4-7 days give or take b/c I tend to use the internet frequently and play music, movies, and games/apps  I was able to play like 5 movies via wifi through netflix...The Battery life is descent I've managed to get about a half hour of playing a first person shooter online, plus about an hour and 40min. of netflix streaming video via wifi, it's impressive, but I personally think I would've been better off getting an ipad to suit my personal needs of media streaming and battery life consumption, I will probably buy the 2nd ipad when it comes out hopefully in February.The only reason that persuaded me to buy this ipod was b/c iphone experience was superb, and the apple app store is so much more expanded than any other app store, I wanted a zune HD (again sound quality much better than ipod touch) but there are like no apps for it plus I don't believe it plays youtube or flash for the matter which is disappointing.  Correct me if im wrong about youtube part from what ive been told.So the big question get this, don't get this ipod?  Well, Idk im okay with it, I think apple could do much better with sound quality, but that's just me I'm really into music I think the average person is different from me which in that case would think the sound is good, which it is descent but I have heard better... Overall 4 stars I think average people would enjoy this much more than I am, I am a tech savy person so quality and terms of usage and things to do with devices really count for me.  Amazing how I wrote this much for a retarded review, b/c it's a hell of a lot longer than any essay i've written which is sad
2	1291334400	When I received my IPOD, there was absolutely nothing in the box with it. No receipt in case I want to return it. No user guide - and most importantly, no USB cable or charger. I could not find anywhere on the Amazon site to contact anyone about it. I thought I got a good deal, but now I have to purchase a USB cable, a wall charger, and a car charger. I am not happy with it at all.
1	1291334400	Even the low resolution scanner app does not work with this camera. Basic cell phones have 2 MP camera these days. Shame on you Apple!.This product is going back.
5	1291334400	I was trying to decide if I wanted to buy this ipod because I already had the 32gb ipod classic with video. I have to say it's worth every penny. I cant think of anything this ipod couldn't do. You can have the traditional music, movies, and pictures, but this ipod does so much more than that! It has apps available that would fit anyones interests from gamers to photographers, to fitness junkies like me. You can do anything you want online, I even looked up a paper I wrote for college. It also has the camera, video recording, face-time, and pretty much everything and even more than you can do on a computer. All of the apps are also extremely cheap if not free, compared to something like a nintendo ds were you pay $30 per game. This ipod is great for any age group, and any range of interests.
4	1291248000	I just got my baby in the mail today and I LOVE IT. I lost my previous itouch and so I ordered the new version. Its soo sleek and feel like magic when surfing through. I hope it does all that is said about it and even more...I got a pretty cool case for it too....so i should be all set for a while...or until Steve decides to come up with something else that will make me feel like I NEED to get.
1	1291248000	My iPod touch was less than 4 hours old when it met its untimely end.  I put it on a coffee table while I went to the bathroom. The coffee table is just under two feet high. One of our cats saw it, thought it was shiny, and knocked it to the wood floor below. The front glass shattered. Apple tells me that it will be a $100 charge to replace.A few days ago, we hosted Thanksgiving. One of our Wedgewood plates fell from the same height and hit the same floor.  It's fine.So I can say with some certainty that the new iPod Touch is more fragile than fine china.  The display looked great for the few hours I had with it, and the cameras still both work.  However, making a media player this fragile is really poor design - completely unusable. What's the point of making it so thin and light if you just have to encase it in something thick and heavy?  Is it fair to give it only one star because one of my cats broke it (which is definitely my fault?) Yes, it is fair. None of the features or functions mean anything if it has to spend its life in a museum case or a safe.
5	1291248000	I love the new iPod Touch. I bought the 8GB version to update the last year's model, a gift for my kid. The new one is thinner and lighter and seems more like an iPhone than ever before. And it handles many tasks for which you may buy a netbook.The biggest new additions are:- A "Retina" display, crystal clear and incredibly beautiful so you can read webpages, comics and PDFs (and even Powerpoints) like never before. I was able to click zoom and do some of my Black Friday shopping off webpages right from the screen on the Touch.-A camera - both front and rear facing so now you can take your own pics and video chat, although the camera is still low res compared to iPhone 4-Microphone so now you can make voice calls on wireless - works great with Fring and Skype apps as well as Facetime . Not to mention some fun apps like Ocarina which allows you to play the flute by breathing into the mic or Google Voice search.- Ability to make HD videos (and upload straight from your device)-A faster processer for much higher speeds, the processor also allows multi-tasking so you can listen to music or Pandora while using other apps-Wireless N for faster downloads - really speeds up websurfing- Can utilize all the benefits of the new iOS 4.2 - locate your iPod Touch, print wirelessly over the air, Airplay - stream content to your TV through Apple TV wirelessly, Gamecenter for social gaming- Gamers will like the new gyroscope sensor for more precise gamingThe best part, with this iPod Touch people can video call each other from different countries (over wireless) and not pay a dime. While the video quality can be sketchy given the network bandwidths, it's still great to see your family from afar and chat for free!! Kids can  "FaceTime" you from their daycare to your office, if you have another Touch/ iPhone.What's the same? The genius as always is in the multitude of apps available for games, education, useful tools, money and travel management, you name it. You can turn off your home lights remotely, play the piano or flute or drums, call a taxi or look up a showtime, make it type what you dictate, recognize the song someone's humming, be a "Pocket God" or just check email/calendar and weather. I have downloaded more than 500 apps since I got my first device and use many of them regularly. And the best part is that 95% of them are free!Is the 8GB enough? It is ok if you are a moderate user. You can use apps like Dropbox to store extra files, or access your music over the wireless remotely. And Netflix and hulu give you access to all the movies you need. But if you want to have a large collection right on the device or are in love with apps, you're probably already considering a larger one.Bottom line, this is the best new gadget you can have or gift to your friends and family. My kid would probably part with me before she parts with her iPod Touch!!
5	1291161600	I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter. She loves it. We have also found dozens of educational apps!
5	1291161600	Impressive...Being a PC & Windows guy, I never gave Apple any thought. Well that all changed when I needed a new Mp3 Player. After doing a lot of research, I decided to give the Ipod Touch a try. Impressive is the word I give to Apple (You now have a customer for life)! For a mp3 player hands down its the best. But the ipod touch is so much more. From apps, email to internet, this little "Computer" does it all. Now I found myself checking email on the ipod instead my computer.Gaming is very good, don't buy PSP or Nintendo Ds, save some cash. The ipod handles games very well and the games are priced way less! Another sweet spot for me for the WIFI. I run a business that does shows and events. For the first time I can now take credit cards on the road. To do this just buy a Virgin MIFI with the $40 unlimited plan (plus it connects up to 5 WIFI devices). In addition by using my MIFI I have turned the Ipod Touch into a Iphone without the contract. Just by using Skype this is possible.Well I've only had my Ipod Touch 4th Generation only about 3 weeks. I love it! Apple has me hooked. So much so I'm gonna buy the Ipad next, and when I upgrade my computer I'm gonna buy a MiniMac.Ohh dont worry about Apple not supporting flash! Eventually HTML 5 will be everywhere, Apple just had a very good start!Now an Apple Fan and a Windows defector!
4	1290988800	I love the 4th generation ipod touch. Just wish they did 16GB instead of 8GB.I play with the itouch everyday at least for 2 hours, love everything about it.If you are an apple fan you will love it, I just wish apple was like other manufactures, where I can watch videos in any format and listen to music in any format. I feel like I'm always converting to a different format thats compatible with itouch.
5	1290816000	ipod touch what can i say its amazing really easy to use....the only downside itsthe battery time it runs out really quick
5	1290729600	This is nicend a cool present for any1really dont write reviews so this is just as long as this ones gonna get
4	1290729600	I have used every gadget and gaming device known to man. I know my gadgets. And this gadget is very close to being perfect. As others have mentioned the rear camera is useless....yes it is. The quality is just awful. I use a DSLR to take pics, not my Ipod. Apple is not in the business of manufacturing cameras...see Nikon or Canon for that.Ok on to the good stuff. The 4th gen is superior to the 3rd gen in every way. Much improved screen, better battery life, smaller and lighter, faster processor, microphone. My 4th gen will play videos the 3rd gen will not due to the higher screen resolution. Two thumbs up. It doesn't get better than this in the screen department and for a device of this size the screen is critical. Do not waste a second deciding between a 3rd gen with higher capacity or a 4th gen...get the 4th gen in any size you can. Personally for me 8gb is plenty. It will hold 5-6 movies, 20-30 games, a few hundred songs. I use my hard drive at home to hold my entire collection, this puppy is just for what I need right now and in the next few weeks.I get around 5-6 hours of battery life. Tremendous considering its size. Would I like more? Of course, but that is for the future. Sound is good for a device of this size but you will want to use headphones for stellar sound. For games and movies the built in speakers are only adequate.My only complaint is being forced to use Itunes. Itunes is sub-par in every possible way. I want to be able to plug this in and drag and drop my files. Too much to ask from Apple apparently. Jailbreak this device and it is perfect. 5 out of 5.As a parent this device will keep your kids entertained for many, many hours. Movies and games aplenty. And this device is sturdy. Just be wary that some games are free to download but then you have the option of purchasing in game goodies with real money without having to put in your Itunes password. Another huge fail by Apple and Itunes. Buried deep in the menu is the option to disable in game purchases....dig deep it WILL be worth your time....you can google the horror stories of 5 year olds racking up $100's in charges for their parents.My 8yo prefers the Ipod to the DS and I prefer it to the PSP for gaming. Rage HD shows what is capable on this device and blows any PSP game to date out of the water. Plants VS Zombies...get it.....you and your kids will enjoy it immensely.
5	1290729600	It was a very fast and came right on time. I just thought 8gb was enough for the use we were going to give the ipod, but when we tried to put all of our music we found out it was too little space. If I would of known that I would have gotten the 16gb
2	1290729600	Beauty is only skin deep. This device will frustrate you by promising so much and delivering maybe a little less than half. Take apps for instance, I never use them and those I have I found to be a complete waste of time and little more than a distraction from life. Or, take the voice activation command--give me a break! Apple also needs to get over itself and start making products that are compatible with accessories from other manufacturers. For 200 clams you don't even get a wall charger with this thing...wtf! And forget about buying a wallcharger from anyone other than apple, who will charge you about $30 for one (when it should cost no more than $5). And the headphones are pretty junky. A $25 pair of Sony headphones will deliver much better sound.This product is also designed to last a maximum of 2 years. After that time the battery will become too weak to keep its charge and Apple will have have come out with at least 2 new iterations of Ipods, tempting you, nay seducing you to buy a new one. Of course, new models are a shell game designed to keep you buying these things because while they look sleeker they offer they deliver the same level of service. It's pretty amazing how far you can get on good looks.
5	1290729600	This is a nice product.I used to have a ipod touch generation 1 for more than 3 years. When I saw this touch with the camera in it I decided to upgrade and it was definitely worth it. cooler, sleaker and better. And this time they threw in a camera also. That made it an excellent browsing and chatting device besides one of the best mp3 players ever made.
5	1290729600	I give the product five stars because it deserves it.  I am very glad that I got the new version of the iPod instead of the older refurb from Apple.  I really like that it has two cameras, one facing forwards and the other rearwards.The shipping only gets one or two stars though.  I placed the order on Nov 14, and its journey to my PO Box started on Nov 16.  During the last ten days, I kept watching the tracking information as the package bounced back and forth across the western US, seemingly at random.  It finally arrived today, Nov 26.  Usually, my Amazon orders arrive in three to five days.
5	1290556800	I also own a iPod Touch 3rd generation. New features on this 4th gen iPod touch become obvious to me. The first impression is the sharper display makes it more comfortable to look at. It does look like an upgrade from the first sight! The added cameras extend iPod Touch's functions, few steps closer to iPhone's.Two weeks after the purchase, I had an accidental drop to the edge of a bookshelf and that badly damaged the screen's bottom area around the home button (which is NOT protected by theGriffin Outfit Gloss High-gloss Case for iPod Touch 4G, Blackit wore on). I am not sure if that glass screen on this 4th gen is not as durable as the 3rd gen's, which stays intact through drops during my over one year usage. Probably the flip leather case on my 3rd gen iPod Touch provides a better protection than the slim case, which is pretty open to impacts at the bottom.I took the damaged iPod Touch to an Apple store and was expecting a hefty cost for screen replacement. Luckily, Apple took it back and gave me a refurbished one without any charges. Thanks, Apple!
4	1290470400	The new ipod touch was on my grandchild's birthday list and the Christmas list.I have looked at all the reviews.I think this gift will be worth the price.I know the child will be happy as I am with all the good talk about it.The speed is pretty fast.The apps. can be picked with care.
5	1290470400	I read all the reviews in Amazon and decided to by the ipod touch 4th generation and not sorry I did.  I have enjoyed it and it is great for my young grandchildren.  Have found many apps that are educational for them.  They are having fun and learning too.
5	1290211200	This is all 2nd hand info seeing how it was a present for my grandsons birthday I'm only going by what he has told me.
5	1289952000	The Ipod touch 4g is the best...really fun ...a lot of free apps you can download and delete right off your ipod...easy touch ...fast ...and great resolution. Camera is not the best but not the worst ...should buy awsome product! Did i Mention Fun!
4	1289865600	I bought this iPod touch 2 months ago. So far, it works well. However, the speaker is terrible. I only listen to music through the earphone.
2	1289865600	If not for the following two disappointments, I won't return it to Amazom:1. Download pictures and videos taken from ipod should be as easy as sync music purchased from apps store from device. No extra purchase of software for such a basic function and expectation is a "must".2. Register to Apps store should not require credit card info, since there are so many free apps available.
4	1289779200	I have always wanted an Iphone but have refused to pay for the outrageous contract, plus I love my Samsung Blackjack for making calls.  After pondering what to do for some time, I decided to purchase the iPod touch and I've never looked back.  The web browsing capacities alone are terrific which allows me to do research and email the pages to myself practically from anywhere.The performance and speed is great as long as you have a good wi-fi connection which this thing picks up from anywhere.  Without saying too much, this iPod will quickly become your most used item.  I think it's a pretty good deal.
2	1289692800	I bought this 1.5 months ago. I loved it because of all the extra space I got compared to the 8gb. I left it on the table where nothing could hit it. 20 minutes later, it was untouched and in the same place, but the screen was broken. It just randomly broke out of nowhere. It has a case on it too. Just be prepared if the screen randomly breaks or if it just stops working.
4	1289692800	initially, i felt forced to get a touch because i needed a portable medication database, but was unwilling to shell out for a monthly data plan.  now that i've had some time to play with it, i've really taken a liking to my touch.  at&t; is so terrible here in SF, that an iphone is just silly and impractical, but the touch is perfect for enjoying the games and gadgets, music, video, camera, and fabulous interface from apple, while still being able to make phone calls.  too bad i'm using two devices, but for now it's the best solution for me.as many other have noted, the battery life is not great, esp while playing games.  i often put mine in flight mode when i don't need to be online, and the battery lasts much longer.
5	1289606400	ok this ipod is the best one! camera is alright for the price well worth it plus what else can you ask for.. it has facetime, cameras, HD and other cool featuresi sold my ipod 2g and bought this! great deal!!'''''/'''''i recommend this iPod!capacity is cool for 8GIGS!
5	1289606400	lots of fun with new camera and face time is great otherwise it seems about the same as the 2g we had. batteries don't last long if you are doing anything except listening to music and the screen is off. we use it mostly with kindle and nook aps. it is a good little reader but again batteries don't last long
5	1289520000	My wife and daughter-in-law both love theirs. It is highly portable, it allows them to check email, stocks, play games and listen to music. What more could you ask?
5	1289433600	This iPod is great. It's HD. So much more clear compared to the 3G. Battery life is pretty amazing. It's also a lot faster than the 3G. Over all, the 4G is amazing. It's worth buying.
3	1289433600	I purchased the newest Touch rather than a first gen IPad having been burned by Apple with the first gen IPhone....never again will I sign a contract with AT&T. The device is used to check email and as a handy gadget to get news, sports scores etc. Within an hour of use I noticed several scratches on the back from normal use. After several days with overnight charges, I used the device in NYC over 8 hours (glancing at the screen perhaps 10 times for perhaps 15 minutes of actual use. The battery gave me the low battery signal. After an overnight charge, I ran it continuously on Pandora and it died in 2 hours. Other than the poor battery life and poor resistance to scratches it will get me to January when the "real" IPad" (i.e. 2nd Gen) will be released with a camera, etc and I can move on.
5	1289433600	This is one of the largest purchases I have had from Amazon and it is great. I got a pair of ipod touches for my wife and I for Christmas (Early HA HA HA). I had a few problem at the start as there are no written detailed instruction included. I followed the set up in Itunes ( I hate putting in a credit or debit card) and I was on my way. 10 minutes later and we were using facetime. This is a great device to use for people of any age. I recommend a larger size for those who have lots of music, books, email, ect...
5	1289433600	You don't need double talk, you need an iPod touch. As long as you have wifi. Don't come here to talk nonsense to Bob Loblaw. Because I know what is best.
5	1289347200	I love the ipod touch! I won it in a contest. I wasn't sure if I would want one, so never purchased one. Well, I have already decided that if this one gets broken, I am buying a new one! I love all the apps, and everything! This is a great item! I love that it has WiFi, and I can check my facebook and my e-mail! Love the games! I am not sure about the music quality as I haven't even put music on it!
5	1289174400	I've had this ipod for a month now and I am very pleased with my purchase. Like always, apple products are nice and solid. The touch feels sturdy and well built.  The screen is gorgeous thanks to the retina display. I would recommend you get it. The only thing is that it only has 8 gigs. They should at least put ten cuz apps take a lot of space, but its ok, that doesnt kill my day haha. anyways im glad i bought this.
5	1289088000	Great ipod touch.  It's use is helpful.  Now there is no need to unpack my laptop at airports in order to check e-mail.  Also entertain myself wathing videos and play games.  A wonderful item to use on an airplane since it doesn't interfere with the plane's navigational system.
5	1289088000	This is my first iPod and I'm so glad that I got one. It's so much fun!
4	1289001600	I had the previous third generation iPod touch but lost it so bought this fourth generation. Use it every day mostly for quick internet browsing. I love the flow and how user friendly the function of this product. I occasionally use it to listen to music or podcast so i'm never worried about filling up the 8mb capacity. I normally download free games and play them in dull moments like waiting to get my tires changed or something.  The fourth generation screen appears to be slightly smaller than the third generation that's my only real slight on the thing.
5	1289001600	Needed a new ipod after using a 2g nano for the last 4 years. THe itouch is amazing. I have not had any problems with it and the apps are very time consuming and entertaining; IMO better than a psp or DS. Plays music very loud, and the mic is perfect; no static and when im making calls on skype or textfree, its clear and perfect.Very satisfied with the delivery time, 2 day shipping. One thing i do reccomend is jailbreaking it to get free apps, some of them are not worth the money since they are not what they say they are or just plainly suck..In the end, no regrets buying it; but i do wish i was not cheap and got the 32gig version to download more apps - didnt know they were gonna be this fun :p
5	1289001600	Just got my ipod 4G in the mail, and after syncing with my computer, I can say I'm impressed!  Especially the resolution of the screen!  Apple wasn't messing around when they decided to make the touches on par with the iphone!  And the volume control for the ear buds doesn't bother me one bit, because I already had a previous pair from an earlier purchase.  Thank you apple for a product that can perform almost any function of that the iphone does.
3	1288915200	I purchased this for my wife's birthday and she loves it.  Had no problems setting it up.  Everything works great.  The only criticism I have is the capacity.  It is advertized as 8 GB.  But as soon as you connect to the computer and go to iTunes, you find out that the capacity is really 6.5 GB. I thought this might be an anomaly unique to this particular unit.  But when I started researching I found lots of other users of the 4th generation "8 GB" that had the same problem.  There is no response that I could find from Apple.  Some of the bloggers said the missing 1.5 GB is the operating system.  But I found that hard to believe.  While my wife is perfectly happy with it and unconcerned about the difference in actual capacity vs. advertized capacity, I would have gone ahead and got the 32 GB model had I known.
3	1288828800	iTouch 4 is okay, nothing's fancy, just same as old iTouchs but added with cameras, it's pretty cool. Still, nothing's fancy.
3	1288828800	Okay let's get this out of the way.  We know the iPod touch rocks.  It has a gorgeous display, great sound, an above average gaming system, and thousands of other apps to spend life minutes on.  All this means nothing to me. You wanna know why???  Well let me tell you a little bit about myself.  I take extreme care with my electronics.  I hate for my things to get scratched.  That being said, I also hate to ruin the beauty of an iPod touch with an ugly rubber case or even those invisi-shields.  I don't care what they say, it is really obvious when you have one on and it affects the aesthetics of the thing.  Anyhoo, I caved and bought a rubber case that wasn't so bad but it doesn't matter.  YOUR IPOD WILL GET SCRATCHED.  There is nothing you can do to prevent this!!  You can treat it like a newborn baby but it DOES NOT MATTER.  I've held off on getting an iPod for years because of this solitary fact. I thought since the iPhone 4 was scratch resistant so would the Ipod.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE! Unfortunately Apple continues to use that cheap finish which seems to be scratched by the atoms flying in the space between my rubber case and the air. It is insulting to spend so much money on something that will basically look deformed in a couple of weeks.  So needless to say I returned mine within the return period.  FYI I've had a Zune HD, (not as cool as the ipod cause of the app thing but still a wonderful music player) for over a year with no rubber protection and it is yet to get nicked.  Oh and 2nd FYI the scratching thing applies to the front display as well the chrome backing!  Come on Apple! Get a freakin clue already!!!
5	1288742400	Perfect product for non-iPhone users. You have all the wonderful features and access to fun apps without the phone calls. I suggest keeping a charger close by because you will use it ALL THE TIME.

5	1288656000	Es el mejor dispositivo que he comprado. Las aplicaciones son my buenas, la interfaz cambi&oacute; radicalmente y la calidad de las im&aacute;genes es insuperable. El sonido es muy potente (recomiendo comprar los aud&iacute;fonos con control) y es f&aacute;cil de instalar. Yo ten&iacute;a uno de 3 generaci&oacute;n ylos cambios son evidentes la c&aacute;mara frontal y la posterior le dan nuevas funciones. Altamente recomendado. Por el lado de Amazon muy serios y entrega r&aacute;pida y segura.
5	1288656000	I got the Itouch 4th generation 8 gb for my daughter, who informed me that it was all that was expected and moreI cannot give a personel review as I wont be back in the US until mid november.The delivery was in the time frame I requested without any disruptions. The way I like it to be.
5	1288483200	i have had my ipod touch for a month now and i already have two days of video! i love this ipod so much! i had never had an mp3 player before so coming from nothing to the newest ipod touch. i am a college student so everywhere i go my itouch goes with me, more than my cellphone sometimes! well i use this thing so much that i always have somethin to show my friends and i can always find something fun to do when we're bored, basically its my adventure device!
4	1288396800	i got this ipod 2 weeks after it came out. the camera was the best thing they could have added i use it all the time. the picture quality is pretty good for a ipod. i wanted the speakers to be a little louder they arent very helpful if noone can hear it. also  i would recomend getting at least the 16gb 8 just isint enough i have over 3gb of music and thats only for 400 songs. since now there is more room taken up by the pictures and the apps. you need to get a case as soon as you get the ipod because the back gets scratched so easily im not sure if the cases were avaliable yet because when i got mine i went to stores for 2 weeks and they didnt have the cases for the new ipod yet. i since than gave up on trying to find a case but i did get screen protectors since there werent any for the new ipod i got the iphone one and the hole where you talk is just the right size not to block the camera on the front. the internet works very well and fast it was so easy to connect to my wireless internet and it remembers so i dont need to keep adding the code. overall i enjoy this ipod very much. i am glad with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone i would just tell them to be sure what size you want and to make sure to get a case and screen protectors.
5	1288310400	Cheaper than stores and it comes pretty fast. Only thing wrong is that i have a minor light leak, but a lot of touches have them.
4	1288310400	I've always wanted the Iphone but without the expensive phone part.  I have a cell phone that  I pay very little for.  But I lusted after the  Iphone cam, the apps, etc.  The first 3 gens of the touch were meh.. And finally...the 4G... Camera, retina, fast chip!Fantastic and worth the 3 years I waited
5	1288310400	Ipods are the easiest MP3 player to use! The battery life is pretty good and there are so many apps and games for this phone that makes it so fun!
1	1288224000	BEWARE:  When you receive your ipod, enter the serial number to Apple to make sure it is the correct product.  I purchased a 3rd generation from Amazon, but several months later when it stopped working and would not recharge or work with plug in, I was going to send it off to Apple for repair.  When I entered the serial number I found out that the 3rd generation I had ordered was a 2nd generation.  My receipt shows I purchased a 3rd generation.  When I returned it to Amazon, even though they had initially sent me the wrong product, they did not give me a full refund.Whether your product is 2nd, 3rd, 4th or whatever - be sure they did not give you a older model.
1	1288137600	Another one to get old? 8 gb for 200 some dollars with creappier camera and everything. I am the owner of a second gen ipod touch. I am kinda disappointed with apple being the memory on the itouch second gen is smaller and the features are dieing two, no camera, no retina display, no wireless n. If you are into the newest technology and everything, go for it. Otherwise just stop and think, is this really worth it? If you do get a one do consider getting a bigger sized one not the 8gb. Just some wise words so you don't really feel scammed later. Still no flash on the ipod touch, another big disappointment.
5	1288051200	prosnice screen -retna display is amazinglots of apps at a resonable price and or freenotesextra proscamera (a bit cheep but cant complain)hd video recordingfolderscostom wall papergame centercons wifi eats up batteryoverall i would def reccomend this product to a friend and am very greatful to finally own an ipod touch
5	1288051200	This little gadget can do so many things, that I don't even know where to start. I bought the 2nd Generation Ipod Touch in 2008, and couldn't have been more pleased with it, but when I heard about this 4th generation Ipod touch, and saw all of these new features that were included, I went to the apple store, checked it out, loved it, and ended up buying it later on. I  really love that it has 2 cameras, and they included facetime. I don't like that its VGA, maybe they could've done better there, but I'm not going to complain so much. The processor is way faster, than my 2nd gen itouch, and the display is 10x better, the colors are more vivid and intense, it seems a little thinner than its predecessor's, and nothing in shape or size like the iphone 4. All in all I really recommend this product, you can do so much with it, and I really think its worth the price.
5	1288051200	Love the picture!  Very clear. Sound is great and love the camera and video that can be used on it.
5	1287878400	I live on a large college campus where free wifi is available everywhere; this makes the ipod touch invaluable. I often use it to keep organized with Google Calendar, read my email on the go, or check the weather. It's a great music player, I find it more useful as a mobile computer. Bought the 8GB version for $224
4	1287878400	I'm an iPhone 4 and an iPad owner. I bought this to use in places where I can't have my phone, such as work. I'm a nurse so I have some medical/ nursing apps on there. The camera is a fun little addition. I fail to see why people are so upset that it can't replace your digital camera. Ditto for those who are whining that it doesn't have all the features of the iPhone 4- Apple is a business-it would be stupid of them to give you something with all the functionality of the iPhone.These reviews by people who expect everything because they're too cheap to get what they really want are getting tiresome. Want something that takes excellent photos? Get a digital camera and quit whining already. Want the bells and whistles of the iPhone- then get a freaking iPhone already. Again, Apple is a business, not a charity. They don't have to give you everything your little heart desires and you don't have to give them your money.
5	1287705600	The new Ipod touch 4 8gb is amazing! From video chatting to making folders or to just setting a home screen background photo it is a great gift and tool! It takes very good videos and has amazing recording! I love my Ipod touch and would recommend it to everyone, and when you order it off of Amazon the shipping is fast, easy, and very trust worthy. I got my Ipod 4 days after I ordered it and was very happy with how fast it came and how protected it came! Can't wait to see what else Apple and Amazon have coming in the near future!
5	1287705600	I hardly use my laptop  anymore. Its fast, and takes an incredible picture. I'm sure it has many features I'm not using, but it fits my needs perfectly.
4	1287705600	The product is great, but it didn't come with the charger. Isn't it supposed to include a charger?
5	1287619200	El ipod touch 4g es una maravilla, definitivamente una belleza. La bater&iacute;a tiene una duraci&oacute;n de 7 horas comprobadas, la pantalla es super clara y n&iacute;tida y la opci&oacute;n de multitarea es excleente, se puede acceder al correo , jugar, ver el clima ,etc.. al mismo tiempo.La c&aacute;mara frontal tiene buena resoluci&oacute;n, suficiente para video conferencia. La c&aacute;mara trasera ofrece una resoluci&oacute;n en fotos muy buena, con opci&oacute;n de zoom y control de iluminaci&oacute;n,suficiente para tomar fotos claras , n&iacute;tidas y subirlas a cualquier red social de forma r&aacute;pida.En cuanto al video, la c&aacute;mara ofrece alta resoluci&oacute;n comprobada y un software muy intuitivo que en pocos pasos permite subirlos a youtube, adem&aacute;s existe una funci&oacute;n sencilla de editar videos.En cuanto a la capacidad de almacenamiento: los 8gb ( me quedan 990mb libres)  me permitieron albergar 670 canciones, 1gb 900 mb ( es decir 57apps) de juegos y utilidades, dos videos grabados desde el ipod y dos fotos tomadas en el ipod tambi&eacute;n.Descubr&iacute; que se puede almacenar fotos en skydrive mediante la app de Msn Messenger, as&iacute; que de esta forma se puede optimizar el espacio.En cuanto a la compra y el transporte debo felicitar a Amazon, el producto lleg&oacute; un d&iacute;a antes de lo planificado y en perfecto estado.
1	1287619200	I bought this item for my 8 year old son.  The pathetic thing is that even an 8 year old knows that this ipod touch 4g is terrible.  He has gotten used to using an iphone 3gs and we all notice the difference in quality between the two.  the Touch 4g is much slower and glitchy even with limited apps and no music/video on the device.  turn the screen horizontal and wait 4 seconds for itouch to do something.The battery life is aweful, the camera is pathetic, and worst of all the volume and power button are not working correctly.  you cannot turn the volume down or up half of the time.  Even worse, you cant turn off the unit the other half of the time making the battery issue even more frrustrating.SOOOO, sorry little kid, we have to take your new ijunk to the Apple store 60miles away and see if there is any way to fix this brand new item you wanted so bad.ridiculous.
2	1287532800	This unit works as designed like the previous generations before it.  Still prone to nasty fingerprints and scratches all over the device. I was sad to see how tightly coupled to Apple the product still is.  It wont even turn on for the first time unless you have iTunes installed. My 10 year old daughter had a hard time creating an iTunes account because she doesnt have a credit card. Dont get me wrong the unit works well, and the features are very simple (maybe too simple and lacks advanced features when needed), however you never feel like you own the device rather your just borrowing it from Apple and must take care of it according to how they want you too.  I think the latest Android devices are more my style.
3	1287532800	Yes, I love the brighter display than my 2g Ipod...and the multitasking...and the slim design...and finally adding a camera and voice...but I'm so disapointed that this thing cannot take a DECENT picture, and that they couldn't include a LED flash.  I thought it was going to compare to my son's iPhone 4, but it's not even close.  I feel duped by Apple, as I'm sure the next model will include that...typical holding back features so they have something to sell next year.  Too bad the rest of it is so nice, otherwise I'd switch to another brand.
5	1287532800	I recently bought this ipod for my husband for his birthday.  Neither one of us has ever owned an ipod so it was all a new experience for both of us.  We are both very pleased with the overall product and the quick delivery!
4	1287446400	In general, the Touch 4th generation performs good, such as the sound quality, entertainment, wifi, etc. But the battery life may be a little short according to its limited volume. And its camera is not very good without zoom, so the photos are just so so, but the videos perform good. Generally, I like it very much.
5	1287360000	We ordered this itouch for my son's birthday. He is now a very happy (and proud) itouch owner and has already learned many of the outstanding features this device offers, and has had no issues learning to navigate through it's many menus and apps. His brother got an "older" itouch for his birthday 6 months ago, and now he thinks his itouch is a piece of crap because his brothers itouch is better. :-) (but little brother had to withstand 6 months of older brother rubbing it in his face about his itouch ... so what goes around comes around :-) !! )
4	1287360000	The iPod was was already at my house 2 days early. I didn't like how the iPod was opened and sealed back with Scott tape. But they said that the iPod was open because they just wanted try on their cases. So overall I think it ws okay.
5	1287273600	This product was fantastic. The system, is of course, flawless. The new retina display is truly a change from the second and third generation. The only downfall is the still shots of the camera, very grainy. I would have easily payed more for a better performing camera, like the iphone 4. This is a great deal, way better than buying it directly.
4	1287014400	The last time i had a Apple Ipod Touch was the First Generation of Ipod Touch.Its been something something years now since i didn't bother buying the 2nd & 3rd Ipod Touch.The 4th Gen touch is Light weight,Smaller,Faster and has a Cameras! which it sucksQuality is really bad when you upload it to the computer. It looks fines when you review the picture on the ipod touch.Also i notice their is another added feature is the bluetooth & voice commands Awesome.
5	1287014400	I can honestly say now that I own the new 4th generation ipod touch for over 2 weeks and tested it out extensively. I don't know how can somebody give it a 1 star. Thats crazy! This ipod is the best ipod to date that apple has produced. I have owned other ipod and ipod touch original and I was taken away by the speed and versatility that this ipod has. The facetime feature blew me away. Me and a friend tested it out and the video quality and sound is fantastic for its size. The HD video is also great. So much in a small package to that of the 1st gen amazes. The retina display lets you see even finer details on application that support this. The retina wallpapers are beautiful to diplay. And yes, for its small size, the speaker in the underside does deliver when your on a plane or at night but you will need the ear phones on a crowded street. The only drawback I see is the camera still pictures. It is only good for web uploads. I went with friends to a holloween event and the picture quality is lacking to that of the iphone which has 5 megapixel still camera. It would be nice to have that 5 mp camera with the HD video and leave your regular camera at home. Neverthless, it doesn't take away the other things that this ipod does. Love this ipod and besides the still camera,apple is going to have a tough convincing me to buy the next generation of ipod touch. The only other thing that captures my attention is putting a 3G chip to get internet anywhere.
5	1286928000	I have an iPod Classic, so this is my first iPod Touch.  I purchased the 8GB and really enjoy it!
5	1286409600	I just recently bought this device and I am extremely satisfied. The Ipod Touch 4g does everything you can think of. This is such a revolutionary little device that sometimes you even forget its an MP3 player because you can do so much with it. Thanks to the built in Wi Fi(which is faster than the older models) you basically have a little computer in your hands.Great Product.
4	1286323200	I am surprised how quickly I used up the memory and had to go back and re-select some songs that were just so so. I have not used the camera/video and I am guessing that will eat up even more memory. 8GB is not enough if you have a wide selection of music and like to hear audio books while you travel. Other than that I am happy with the itunes and Apple iPod. They are easy to connect and work with a very fast download of songs.
4	1286323200	Steve Jobs is a GENIUS and his "genius" has gotten me every time!  I first got bitten by the touch bug when 2nd gen came out.  I bought it when it launched and was happy as came be with the product.  So happy in fact that when 3rd Gen came out I bought it at launch.  Happy again.  Then came 4th gen.If you are looking for your first touch or have an older one (2nd gen/1st gen) I would certainly buy this product.  The upgrades you will see will blow your mind!If you are like me and you are sitting with your third gen with the new OS on it wondering if you should upgrade to fourth gen, I'd so NO!  The camera is an upgrade that is nice but that's about it.  Besides that, the 3rd gen and fourth gen are almost identical.  $239 for an hd video camera plus all the other features of a touch is not bad at all, but I still say that an upgrade is a bad move..here's why.If you are familiar with Apple, you know that they purposely leave "obvious" features off of a product just so that they have something to upgrade in the future.  For example, look at first gen Iphone's camera.  During Job's keynote he said, "We are revolutionizing the phone" and they did, but what happen to the video camera?  Video was already in Berries, Treos and Q's.  The Ipad has no camera.  These are all little things that they leave out for the next gen.So what about Ipod Touch???  The upgrade from 3 Gen to 4 Gen is slight as I've said (basically it's a camera).  But I think the upgrade from 4 to 5 (next September) will have something HUGE!  What is the "obvious" feature left off 4th gen?  3G!  The Ipad has 3G but no camera.  The Touch has the cameras but no 3G.  The next Gens in Sept of 11 will swap those features.  Pad will get cameras and Touch will get 3g!Like all Apple products, the touch is AMAZING!  But if you are upgrading, I'd say wait!
5	1286064000	If in your daily life you are usually in an area that has WiFI access (University, Work, etc.) I believe that the iPod touch is an excellent alternative to the iPhone 4. At thirty dollars a month for an iPhone's data plan, one could pay for an iPod touch with only eight months of service. With the iPod touch, you can concentrate on life when not connected and enjoy faster than 3G WiFi when you are connected.The integrated and prescient operating system is very impressive to me (I was originally a skeptic, too). When checking email, you can easily put each new email into a specific folder or delete it with just a quick touch or two. upon receiving an email relating to an upcoming even, with a couple of touches one can create a new event in their calendar and the iPod automatically fills in the date, time, and name of the date. This really saves time and is just one example of the seamless integration that makes staying up to date and organized easy and pleasurable.The bluetooth keyboard connectivity raises the possibility that, with outside printer and computer access, even a college student can have an iPod touch in place of a computer. I am currently attempting this.Having the interent and podcasts etc. at you fingertips gives you real opportunities for broadening your horizons and enhancing your capabilities.Please do yourself a favor a buy this if you are interested in having convenient internet access, staying on top of your email, and staying organized with calendars and notes. I bought mine at Wal-Mart, where I could return it within 15 days if I decided it wasn't worth the price and wouldn't be useful to me.I won't be returning it.
5	1285804800	It is a great device but of course the cameras could be better but the ipod itself is AMAZING!!!! it is better than any other ipod the only apple portable device that could beat it is the iphone 4 besides that sell your other ipods or iphones and buy this ipod it is totally worth it
3	1285718400	I'm not the best at explaining things, but I can say this much: save your money. The new iPod Touch is fast. Like really really fast. It also has some very nice features such as the built in camera, microphone, apps like facetime etc. BUT. Would I recommend it? No. The camera quality is terrible. Nothing like the iPhone. Apple will most likely release a better iPod Touch next year; like they always do. Also, personally, for me the retina display is annoying and hard to focus on.
5	1285632000	The fact that you get something worth over $400 for $220 with-out subsidizing it through a 2 year contract is amazing. A great supplement to my Motorola Droid!
5	1285632000	This puppy does HD video Podcasts such as CNET Car Tech Loaded etc.Have 3RD generation too and it does not.Beautifull!!!!Get the 32GB instead of 8Gb You will need the space for HD.
5	1285545600	Hey guys!  I don't know why the iPod touch 4g is stuck with having a 4 star overall rating, because this is definately deserving of a perfect 5.  Unfortunately, that's as high of a rating as I can give it :(  I just have one thing to say to people who are pondering buying this, or losing sleep wanting one.  Buy it already!  It's like having a mini iPad, only now it has two cameras; it's more portable then the iPad; and you can do everything that a computer can do.  Surf the internet; send and receive e-mails and video calls; with certain apps you can text anyone on their mobile phone for free (well, you're texts don't cost you anything, but they'll still have to pay the .10 cents).  Games are awesome, especially since they are updating a lot of them to take more full advantage of the Retina Display (which is..you guessed it, AWESOME!I can't give this iPod anything but a quadruple thumbs up (because I'm an alien with four hands, duh!)  Buy one, you won't regret it.  But get the 8g, because 32 is just too much space to spend an extra $50.00 on.  8g's holds plenty of games videos and music, trust me :)~APlaceOfMagic~
5	1285459200	I am a new owner to Ipods, I always wanted to check them out but never got to it. I am glad I finally did. This thing is beautiful, the web browser is fast and looks great, the 6 games I've played around with run very well and are fun to play. Recording video is nice and looks nearly as good as my Flip ultra hd. Battery is fairly good (I use it for taxing things like gaming and internet and still get 7-9 hours). Apps are cheap and easy to get. Haven't really used game center yet but I like the premise of it. All in all this is a fantastic all in one device.
1	1285459200	I received 4g iPod Touch yesterday. Whatever I tried, the newest iPod Touch was much slower than my 2g iPod Touch. I did speedtest several times and noticed the 4g iPod Touch always had network speed slower than 0.5M (one time even dropped to 0 and the test could not complete), while the old iPod Touch always had network speed higher than 2M.Don't buy this new iPod Touch.
5	1285372800	for those of you who are crying about how it's not the iphone, DUUU!!! if apple sold it as a lagit iphone. then the wouldn't make money from the iphone contracts which are expensive. the screen is far superior to the itouch 3, and the rear camera is awseom!!! much better than i thought it would be thanks to the reviews ive read, which are all BS. Don't listen to the ones that say," o the camera sucks," or," the screen isn't as good." it is far better than it's predicessor. the apps open faster, videos load more quickley, just an all around better product. ill post a youtube comparison of the two ipods, to show the actual differences. I love the new itouch, and all you haters can kiss it's butt.P.S. it weighs less which keeps my pants from sagging.
5	1285372800	It's simply Iphone 4g without a contract, I highly recommended this to everyone, but do not expect high quality photos, Screen: Amazing, Battery Life: 7 hours of playing games, Face Time: my friend called me from his Iphone and it's great, Rent or Buy Movies, Light weight, and Fast shipping.
5	1285286400	This is my 2nd ipod touch i had.And i can honestly say it is beyond awesome. The retina display is beautiful. A4 processor definitely is a upgrade from my ipod touch 2nd gen i can tell the major speed difference. I still getting used to the new design but personally i liked the old one better. The cameras are ok there a bonus if you ask me. Overall this is the best ipod to date.
3	1285113600	I bought this IPOD Touch 4 generation to use on my Bose SoundDock 10, but unfortunately, it won't fit on it.  I am very disappointed.I even bought, Universal Dock adaptor from apple but there is no use.I am waiting for Bose to come up with some solution to this.Bose customer support asked me to call them later as they are still testing the new series of IPODs on their systems.Other than this, everything works fine. But for me, the prime purpose is not fulfilled.
5	1285113600	This is the best ipod out of all four of them by far, with it's hd recoding and 3.0 megapixle camera it is amazing!
5	1285027200	Anyone who has ordered the new ipod touch 4g have you guys gotten your ipods yet or has amazon shipped them? cause my estimated delivery is between october 5-19th but im wondering if any1 out there has gotten theirs from amazon yet?
4	1285027200	I have actually played with this iPod line and let me tell you it is an iPhone with out the phone. I have heard and read many reviews but I don't mind. I am waiting for a shipping notice but I have noticed it is like it is being BackOrderd. Please Apple & Amazon speed it up.
1	1284940800	The new generation iPod touch is a very nice model. Actually, let me rephrase this: *was* a nice model before Apple came up with iOS4 upgrade. Although the new OS enhances some functionalities, it has a major downside: with wireless left on, you iPod's battery will be dead in less than a day. Before that iOS3 would shut fown wi-fi when the device went into sleep mode, but now you have to micromanage the battery life yourself.To make things worse, there is no easy way to downgrade your system to the "good old times", as Apple swiftly removes the software signatures for the previous versions, making it impossible to do a restore with iTunes.The iOS4 has been around with us since June. Apple so far ignores all the pleas from the users (see for example [...]). If you don't need wireless or you are fine with battery micromanagement, the device should work for you, but then: why exactly do you need an i-pod touch?Don't get me wrong: it is a nice gadget. Err... was.
5	1284940800	Apple iPod touch 8 GB (4th Generation) NEWEST MODELMy dream (owning the latest gen ipod touch with cameras for sub [...]) came true when Steve jobs announcement put all new ipod touch  models into a same category (i.e., all features same except the memory capacity). Thank God, I did not purchase an iPad (the sole reason: lack of cameras). Latest ipod touch is indeed a mini-ipad and extended kindle for me. No way, I can't use an ipad (1 and 1/2 pounds is too much, I guess Apple will surely take care of it in next iteration) as an e-reader. Kindle is almost the perfect e-reader on the market. 8GB version of ipod is ideal for me bcz apps do not take a lot of space and I hardly use it for listening music! I did not buy it for the music, for me it's usage is as the portable tablet. I am eagerly looking forward for the accessory, that Apple applied patent for, that can turn ipod touch into cheapest iPhone!PS: I am among the first few who ordered it on Amazon on Sept 1st and scheduled to receive it by tomorrow (at last!). I will update you again after playing it with for a while.===========================Updated on Sept 23, 2010===========================I am playing with my mini tablet for past 3 days and these are my initial impressions.Wow, it shipped directly with iOS 4.1 update.Size: I felt Apple did beyond what is needed in this front! It is too thin that you find it hard to keep it firm in your hand. Beware, in case it slips out of your pants, you wont notice it at all! Those who plan to use it naked without any case (or with a sleeve), will have a tough time to keep it not falling from your fist. So better go for some cover that holds it permanently. It also helps it from getting scratches and finger prints on sleep finish on the back.User Interface: As someone coming from Blackberry and 1st gen ipod, I am blown away from Apple's very intuitive interface. You hardly need any manual or help to use it. It is just tap and go. My 2 and 1/2 years kid is able to use it for drawings and browsing through photos w/o much help from myself. I wish PC world takes a leaf out of this. I am fed up with UI that I am seeing in PCs for past decade.Retina display: Simply stunning. Good opportunity for mobile TV and movie/tv show rentals.Mail: I am amazed with this integrated MailBox feature. While it takes ages to browse through all my mails in my laptop, I could finish finish reading all mails in this iPod even before my laptop turns on!Cameras: I agree that their resolution would have been better. One can take photos from both cameras seamlessly. But quality of snaps is decent enough with both cameras. 720p HD videos that I took from back camera are really stunning. It is so so easy to share snaps and videos with friends and posting on youtube. Everything happens inside camera App.Facetime: It's a unique feature. I am waiting for my friends to buy iphones/ipods to use this App. It would be great if Apple brings this to PCs. Then it will pose a serious threat to skype, Gtalk, etc.Battery: I am somewhat disappointed with battery lifetime. Should I blame myself for doing so many things on this tiny device?!APP Store: One of the main reasons for buying iPod in the first place. There are so many great apps. I checked some of the apps for kids. They are so good and dam cheap (even free). Again iPod is a serious threat to Leapster and Mobigo gaming consoles in addition to PSP and DS Lite.NiKE+GPS APP: This is my first ever paid, which looks so good and I say dam cheap. No sensor requirement. I do not bother much about not exploiting GPS feature of app as it will drain your battery before you even finish your walk! It is able to track my movements very well. I tested when I am in bus, it's smart, wont say I am running, unless you shake it widely by holding in your hand.Cons: Too thin to hold securely! It is hard to press volume and sleep buttons with single hand.Battery is OK.It rebooted a couple of times when I am downloading my kindle books.As I said in the beginning, it is my extended kindle. It allows me and my wife reading kindle books simultaneously. While iBooks is a good app, I prefer kindle bcz Amazon has vast no of books and it offers several books like classic and promotional ones free of cost. Kindle is just worth its price for its battery life (I do not remember when I charged last time!) and reading out-doors. So Kindle + iPod Touch > iPad, is n't it?
5	1284940800	Having lived my adult life through the computer revolution, I felt compelled to add my 2 cents' worth to this comment section about the iPod Touch 4G. I am compelled because it seems that all of the promise of this revolution has been realized with this gadget. OK, you may think I am inflating a trivial personal gizmo, but just stand back and look what his little thing does. All of the promise we had for computers 30 or so years ago has come to fruition beyond our ability to imagine. We can connect to anyone in the world. Free worldwide phone calls on Skype. Video phone connection for FREE! Every song I ever heard in my life cataloged and on demand. An entire library of books to choose from. Take HD video and still shots. And games. Wow. It blows me away. And I'm just hitting the high points. My 73 year old Mom loves it. The user manual is about 10 pages long. Take a picture or shoot video? No directions needed. Design design design.Critics, keep complaining so the engineers will never stop their improvements. I will never stop my child-like amazement at this wonderful device.
5	1284854400	So, i had made my order on September 13 with free super saver shipping and  today i noticed that the shipping time was the 23d and delivering on the 24th. I contacted amazon and told them about it and they fixed it. But.. they also gave me free Standard Shipping :D so instead of delivering sometime near october 10 i get it september 27th
5	1284854400	My original review focused on whether you can successfully use an 8 gb version of this 4th gen iPod Touch in lieu of a more expensive, larger memory version. My conclusion (at the end of this highly revised review) was, and remains, a resounding YES but there is one aspect, that applies to ALL the iPod Touch 4th generation editions (8/32/64 gb), that I now think is MUCH more important:The quality of the screen display.Simply put, this device has near-iPad screen quality in a 3.5" device. (960x640 resolution at 326 pixels per inch, vs. 1024x768 resolution at 132 pixels per inch).That means you can get almost iPad quality video in approximately 3.6 ounces of device vs. 24 ounces of device; in a device that fits a shirt pocket vs. a device you need a separate bag for. In a device you can hold up as a reader vs. a device that tires your arms.This Touch is VERY practical for reading NYTimes articles or USAToday articles in their reader applications, optimized for this size display (crisp, large type). VERY practical for browsing the regular on-line editions of most newspapers (tap once to fit a column to a screen with nice readable type). GREAT for YouTube since the YouTube app included with the device is optimized for delivering high def YouTube content - if available, HD videos are automatically preferred. GREAT for Netflix and Hulu Plus. GREAT for gmail and ok for Facebook (I am sure FB will make its dedicated app more user-friendly in the future).Great, for me, for online banking and stock research/trading.Great for catching up on tech websites in their "mobile" formats.So-so for Yahoo; I don't like Yahoo Mobile right now and their regular online edition, via the built in Safari browser, doesn't scale up and down as nicely as the online NYTimes does.And oh yeah, the device can store adequate amounts of your own music library (or stream Slacker or Pandora, customized for you, in free or pay editions) and download iTunes paid video content for later consumption, stream to Apple TV, or you can move your own DVD content to the device via easy conversion programs.Last year I ventured out on some vacations with an iPod Touch, the last generation, as a "backup" to my netbook. I found myself easily reading emails, but preferring the netbook for replies. I didn't read any books with it until earlier this year, and was surprised by how well book reading worked. I Skyped home.When this new generation Touch came out, I got it as a matter of reflex, justifying the purchase on the basis of the built-in camera and built-in microphone (which means I don't have to use "inline mics" with ear buds any more). But in reality, the sharpness of the screen  is MUCH more important. I have now, simply as a result of this device, switched to e-reading from print reading. On the road, this has largely displaced the netbook (except for reviews like this); most friends communicate in shorter emails these days anyway, and most emails are ads and blurbs, not stuff you need to reply to.But now at home I find myself ALSO using this new generation iPod Touch a LOT. In the morning to check emails for anything really important, to check NYTimes headlines, before I even roll out of bed. Anytime I want to check emails or Facebook the rest of the day, without firing up the regular desktop computer. At bed to read.In short, the darn thing is a working computer. Great for CONSUMPTION, patience-testing for INPUT. (Although forcing my input to slow down, say, for Simple Notes entries may be a good thing - forces me to slow down and be a lot more concise.)***********A word on gaming and pricing. My kids have the 8 gb, 4th gen (this one) model and LOVE it for games. The motion detector is VERY responsive and watching a 3.5 y.o. use "dual thumbs" on the screen blows me away. You will NOT get the same screen responsiveness and motion detection on an Android device. Some developers are even reluctant to develop Android versions because the hardware for Android devices simply has too many variants in the marketplace vs. much smaller overall market share. This can change, but for now Apple dominates the gaming market. This week Apple is offering the Touch in 8 gb mode for slightly over 2 bills but with a 25 gift card. The value for dollar is incredible. Think carefully before you try to find a substitute! (FWIW I love Apple hardware but don't like the "locked down" system it has become - I hate having to use iTunes as "Grand Central Station" for Touch operations. So I am actually inclined to be biased AGAINST Apple, but in the case of the Touch the results are simply too good to ignore.)***********Best accessory ever:ClassicReader Three-pair Valu-Pac, +3.00The screen on this new generation of iPod Touches is very, very sharp, but in order to enjoy all that sharpness, you need to bring the screen really close to your eyes (assuming you don't have presbyopia and can focus close) OR simply carry a pair of cheap reading glasses as an "accessory" to these super sharp 4th generation screens. This lets you actually read the tiny type on the NY Times website, actually see the richness of colors and depth of detail on a video. So even if you don't need reading glasses for magazine reading, CONSIDER trying a pair of STRONG reading glasses (1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, or even 3.0) to magnify the 3.5" display screen. Strong reading glasses make high-def YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu Plus videos POP for me.My original review, edited to be slightly briefer, is below, so you will know where most of the pre-12/20 comments come from:______________________Can you get by with an 8gb Touch?Yep, based on my experience with a 3rd gen 32 gb, and on my recent local purchase of the 4th gen (this current model) in 8 gb capacity.When using the old 32 gb, I found out that I barely used its greater storage capacity. (I don't haul around a lot of music or videos - I just transfer what I want to listen to/watch for each road trip or listening/viewing cycle using iTunes). Apps, I discovered, don't take up much space, even games and books don't take up much space, unless you want to haul substantially more of your whole collection with you. Amazon's Kindle app is esp. device friendly, since you can archive books you've finished back to Amazon instead of keeping them on the device. iTunes is a great way to manage what content you want to store on your home computer - which becomes a sort of large "docking device" - and what you want top take "to go."As a netbook substitute, storage isn't even that important. I can check my bank balance, transfer funds and execute orders on a brokerage account, listen to radio on Pandora or Slacker, watch music videos (and a lot more ) on YouTube, Skype, stream Netflix, and do a whole lot of other stuff on the 8 gb just fine.In fact in hindsight the only real reason for me getting the 32 gb version in the older edition was to get the faster processor. But in the current generation, ALL THE 4th GENERATION HARDWARE IS THE SAME, except only for memory.Do keep in mind on the 8gb edition you give up about a gig to systems operations, leaving only 7 gb or so for your stuff. And you need to leave from for apps and their space. I probably wouldn't put more than 6 gb of music and videos on the 8gb version. The other editions also give up the same space, but proportionately it is a smaller "hit" to your storage.The 8gb makes a nice intersection on my personal "cheapness" and "minimalist" curves. The price doesn't get into nose-bleed territory where I start to wonder whether a netbook would makes more sense, and it's inexpensive enough to subject to the toils of daily wear and tear - keeping it handy in an outside day pack pocket, instead of more safely stowed deep inside the pack.
1	1284854400	I got the prior version of this product November 2009, and it worked great for 1/2 year. Apple then "upgraded" the operating system (a software upgrade that happened through iTunes), and now it goes much slower and crashes much more often. Apple does not provide a way to go back to the old operating system, and does not respond to requests for help.
3	1284854400	i haven't even gotten my new itouch yet and am already disappointed.  i, like others, naively thought that jobs was being litteral when he said it's an iphone without the contract.  .7 megapixels? are you serious??? are you intentionally watering down your products just so you csan release a better one the next year?? my 7 dollar samsung solstice has a 2 megapixel camera!! it takes fantastic photos, and all I'm gettin from my 400 dollar itouch is less than half of that? i have seen pictures it takes, and it is embarrassing.  worse than a damn palm.  whats the point in making it skinnier? keep the same frame and put more in it. i am so frustrated about this cuz i have a 1st gen itouch and have waited till it came with a camera to buy a new one for this....
5	1284422400	1st time buying an ipod touch.  Awesome product...  I don't need to compare this to the iphone 4, the flip, etc.  It has all the damn things I need.  Music, Wifi, camera, HD video recording, games, apps, + many more.  This is one useful device to use when I'm in the library.
1	1284163200	This shouldn't be advertised as an iPhone - the phone because it misleads the consumer, which is why I rated this product 1 star. People should really do their research before buying a product. Here are the pro's and con's of this product.Pros:Front cameraBack camera (stills @ 0.7MP)HD 720p video recordingmicrophone built-inRetina display (no IPS = poorer viewing angles)thinnerlighterlonger battery lifeCons (to those who are unaware):Back camera can only take 0.7MP stills = not as good as iPhone 4's (@ 5MP)No vibrator inside for silent alerts (sorry girls)RAM is the same = almost half the ram of iPhone 4'sNo GPS (I never expected it to have one anyways but would have been great to have.)No IPS in the retina display (not such a big deal unless you look at your touch from odd angles)Facetime = Hasn't reached its full potential yet. You are limited to calling other iTouch 4g and iPhone 4 users.Chrome back = attracts oily fingerprints and scratches easilyOVERALL, this is a great improvement from the last generation iTouch but ,as in many advertisements, is not exactly as advertised ("iPhone - the Phone").***Be aware of what you are buying in order to prevent buyers guilt and paying the 10% restocking fee (ouch!).Also, remember that Apple's business model revolves around holding back a little on features and introducing an even better model the following year. (Example: iPad has no camera's but I bet you it will next year)
5	1284163200	First of all, I have the 8gb 4th generation iPod Touch in my hands. So I'm writing about something that I actually own. I purchased it from the Apple website as part of the "Back to School" promotion that ended September 7th--buy an Apple computer and get a free iPod Touch. That's exactly what I did. (I also got a free Epson printer, but that's another story!) I have had it for at least three or four days now. I have had two previous iPods--a first generation 5gb iPod (one of the first iPods for sale) and a 60GB iPod classic that supports music and pictures, but not video. I have experience with iPods and other mp3 players. Until I had to retire on disability I taught audio editing at a Big Ten University. So I think I qualify as someone who knows what they are talking about. So let me say this---what are you people complaining about that the back side camera is less than 1 megapixel? THAT'S the only thing you care about??!!Let's be serious here-the iPod touch, or any generation of iPod for that matter, is not meant to be a picture taking platform! It's intended to be a portable device that will allow you to listen to music, view pictures already taken, playback video and store information. Anything else is pretty much gravy. Look at the other models of iPods to see what I mean. How many of them have cameras?  None. Why? Taking pictures is not what they are supposed to be doing! If you want a really good picture--buy a good camera! And ask yourself--would you complain that the camera doesn't connect to the web wirelessly? Would you complain that the camera doesn't play audio or let you edit and play video? Would you complain that the camera doesn't let you check you're email? Why?  Because that's not what the camera is supposed to do! Think about it. Yes, every cell phone out there has a camera feature. So what? How many of them do what the iPod does? Think about what the iPod touch was designed to do and you will see why this is such a great product. You can access the web wirelessly with "n" speeds, you can play games of just about every imaginable kind, you can get apps either paid or free that allow you to do almost anything you can imagine--including farting in one thousand different ways, you can hear audio better than just about anything else the same size, you can view video better than just about anything else out there the same size, you can learn a foreign language, you can record audio notes with great quality and volume, you can connect via Bluetooth to other devices to transfer pictures or sound or any kind of file, you can check your email from just about every known email app known to mankind, video call to other iPod Touch and iPhone owners (which are more than just one or two people--check the stats about units sold recently) and did I mention the apps? I know I did, it was a rhetorical question. The iPod Touch 4th generation is something out of a science fiction story written in the late 1990's for goodness sake! That was only eleven or so years ago!Quit complaining about a low resolution camera in the back. Look at the positives and more importantly what it is designed to do. The primary purpose is NOT to take pictures of what is behind you. I think this is a great device. My son has a third generation iPod Touch purchased only two months ago (his birthday is mid July and he used his birthday money and hard earned allowance to buy one for himself). He can't believe how much better my 4th generation iPod is compared to his. I have to be careful he won't steal mine. This is a great product. I recommend it highly. Read the other reviews about the many things it does do and the improvements over the 3rd generation iPod Touch. The only thing I don't like is that it's so new there aren't any good cases for it. That's not Apple's fault. I'm sure they are being designed and made by third party developers as I type. It's just a question of time before they are for sale. Buy a 4th generation iPod Touch today, you will not regret it. Unless you intended to buy a camera and bought the iPod by mistake. 9/11/2010
4	1284076800	I bought the 8G model solely to get the retina display.  I cruise the net and store photos and make internet calls.  I don't play childish games so I don't care about apps. It cost $50 more than the 3rd generation and the improved display is worth it.  The cameras stink (both of them) but I don't care because I have 3 SLRs, both film and digital.  This is the only Apple product I own.  All Apple products are rip-offs, costing two to three times as much as equivalent Windows products and delivering no better performance.  Of course the Windows products don't look as fancy and flashy as the Apple products, and don't dance when you put them on a table.  But I don't care about that either.  Apple is a very confused company.  It cannot decide if it sells art or computers, so it gives us both:  mediocre computers at art prices.  That is why its customer base is just a bunch of cultist iFool appleheads.  You know, whenever I see a person with an Apple product, I know I am seeing an immature child, nothing more.  The 8G Touch is the least rip-off product they offer.  Since I don't make asinine videos, I don't care about the higher memory models.  Certainly the nanos are ripoffs; one can buy Sansa players with double the capacity for half the price.  But they come in duller colors.  I rank the 8G Touch 4 of 5 stars for its ease of use, clear and bright display, intuitive menus and overall versatility.  It would get 5 stars if it sold for $50 less.
3	1283990400	Everything is ok,1) skype finally work (my G2 has no mic)2) FaceTime worked, but not as good as expected (TV ad, anyone), look grainy and choppy (2 iPOD on same WiFi N)3) and the biggest let down, still can't pair with my Plantronic BT headset
5	1283644800	What are these reviews all about? Are the comments made by pol who were fortunate to get an advance copy of the product? Went to the Apple Store yesterday, Sep 4. Was told they expect the item "sometime next week". Then placed my order with Amazon. At the end of the ordering process was informed "Expected shipping date Sep 20".So, again, how did these pol get the version 4? Or are these "reviews" based on other pp.'s reviews who had received advance copies for testing?As I await my iPod 4 (ordered Sep 3, expect Sep 20-27, 2010, per Amazon)here are some excerpts from the tech-guru and New York Times tech columnist from today's NYT (Sep 9, 2010):"In Season 9, iPods Still Get High Ratings" (Heading)"Without question, the most droolworthy new iPod is the new iPod Touch"...At 4.4 by 2.3 by 0.28 inches, the Touch is also noticeably thinner, almost nuttily so. You could use it as a letter opener. ""The built-in mike and speaker make the Touch a Wi-Fi cellphone. Apps like Skype  or Line2 let you make free or cheap phone calls whenever you're in a Wi-Fi hot spot. (The speaker's on the bottom, so you can't really hold it to your ear, but the speakerphone or Apple's $30 earbuds work fine.)And using a free app like TextFree, you can send all the text messages you like without paying the phone company anything. ""Above all, Apple intends for the Touch to be the ultimate game machine. Already, the company says, the Touch outsells Nintendo and Sony pocket players combined. The new Touch has the same screaming-fast chip as the iPad and iPhone 4, along with a new Game Center app that lets you compete wirelessly with other iPhone and Touch owners. "Finally, the Bottom Line:"...the new iPods are still beautiful, smooth and a pleasure to use. Yes, yes, that's the consensus every year -- but isn't that a good thing? "So there, this after a REAL HANDS-ON experience from a very experienced user.
4	1283472000	As the title says, Retina != IPS. Retina display is a buzz word that means high pixel density.Retina display is nice since it provides 4 times the pixels compared to earlier versions of ipod touch.But unfortunately the display is not the same as the one used in iPhone 4g.Iphone uses IPS technology which provides wider viewing angle and accurate color representation.While the new ipod touch seems to be based on the much cheaper TN technology.Viewing angle is not too great on TN displays and color seems to look washed out.You can see the difference by taking a look at the hands on video of the new ipod touch on [...]
5	1283472000	OK, folks, this will be my first Amazon review, though I've bought countless other things from the site.  My 64GB 4G is on order, and I'll update my review after I've had some time to play with it.Whereas I agree that the rear facing camera is not what I was expecting, I have to say that the overall improvements from the previous generation are spectacular!I would rate the previous 32GB 3G Touch at 6 stars if I could.  And here's why.The screen is awesome.Great battery life.Barely noticeable in your pocket.It's a book reader (get Stanza)Surfs the internetHold my full CD Library (350 of `em)Plays MoviesDoes Email well.Holds all of your family photos.Reads PDF files.Store and edit MS Office files with QuickOffice.Does calendaring well.Games are awesome.Supports Telnet, RDP and VNC for my job.Quick access to weatherVery nice Maps Calculator, Alarm Clock, et. al.To me it seems to do just about everything!Now comes the 4G Touch.  What are you really getting with the upgrade?  Well, from a hardware standpoint, I've noticed the following improvements from the 3G model....I thought that 256MB Ram becomes 512MB, but Sysmon still reports that it has 256MB ((Rather 247MB)ARM Cortex-A8 833 MHz (600MHz) CPU becomes 1GHz (800Mhz) with same GPUL1 cache 64 KB (was 32KB)480x320 screen becomes Retina 960x640LED screen LightingAdded 802.11n supportGyroscope addedFront facing 640x480 camera addedRear facing 1280x720 camera added (960x720 stills for 4:3 aspect)Battery life increased by 33%Microphone addedPhoto exposure sensor addedThickness reduced by 20% (1.6mm)Weight reduced by 12%  (14g)To me, this is a rather impressive list of improvements on an already mind-numbingly cool product.  Yeah, I wish the camera was 3+ Megapixels, but truthfully, I mostly just look that the photos that take, but rarely want to print them out anyway, so this is not a deal-breaker.  With the G4, I'll now be able to add the following to my list of things that I can do with my iPod....Record 720p video.Make video calls (cool, but we'll see if I use it)Edit my Video.Take photographs.Record audio without digging out my headphones. (Finally)View photos and movies that look like photos, instead of pixels.Use it longer before recharging.In summary, I believe that an iPod touch is something you buy, love intensely for a year, then throw away in favor of the new model.  (That is, if you can afford to do so).  I'm upgrading my 32GB 3G to a 64GB 4G to hold more games and home movies, mainly.  The Retina display alone would have been reason enough for me to upgrade.  With the impressive list of upgrades above, it made the choice a real no-brainer for me.I won't complain that the digital camera that's built into my high-def camcorder isn't as nice as it could have been.  (But I won't begrudge anyone for doing so themselves -- this is a free country that we live in!)ps.  Maybe the G5 will have GPS....  It'd be nice to replace my Magellan and TomTom with and iPod.*Update*Now after having some time to play with the new iPod touch here is what I've found.*The new form factor is very nice.  Of course it's thinner, and the silver bezel around the screen is greatly reduced and it makes it look a much nicer.  You do feel like you are holding and handling a redesigned and improved product.*Surprisingly, it only has 256MB or RAM, or at least this is what the Sysmon app reports on the device.*The Display is revolutionary. Being able to read that tiny tiny text is just amazing.  Who would have thought that they could, or would, manufacture a screen that is so detailed!  Photos now look like real photos!  Games look wonderful and surfing is greatly enhanced by the new display.  Movies look better too.*The video cameras are a very nice addition.  Tap on something on the screen to set the exposure.  This sometimes works quite well, but don't expect great video in low light situations.  Double tap the screen when in video mode on the back camera to change your video aspect from 4:3 to 16:9 and back.*There is now an app button for Facetime, Camera and Game Center.  I don't use the game center so I can't comment.*The Photos app now has a camera roll where your photos and videos are saved.*I've noticed that the device gets much warmer when you use it with the brightest screen settings.*Overall performance is better than the 32GB G3 model.  Noticably better but nothing earth shattering.*Finally a microphone!  I've taken my voice memos app out of hiding and actually intend to use it now.*It is a bit louder than the previous model.  Not much, but noticeably so.Overall, I am very happy with my new iPod.  The lack of more RAM and additional heat that it generates are the only issues that are noticable to me, and the redesign, screen and the cameras are what really help to set it apart from the previous models.If you've never owned an iPod Touch before, now is the time to buy one.  You are sure to fall in love with it.  If you are thinking about upgrading to the new version, consider that the screen and the cameras are the standout new features.  If you don't care so much about taking photos and video on you iPod, the retina display might just be enough to make you want to get the new model.
4	1283472000	When it has came down to the past decade, Apple has shown over the years that it has changed the name of the game in the way we get our music. With all of the success, Apple has shown that well for nearly a decade, since the original Ipod came of age back in 2001. Now, with the success going on for a near decade-long joy, Apple has really shown us a greater way of how we get our information, our music, and our movies. Now with all of that joy, Apple has shown that strength even higher with the success of the Ipod Touch a few years ago. It has continued to bring joy for all gamers and music lovers young and old. Now Apple has done it again, with a new Ipod Touch that brings in a distinctive touch, but a few misteps along the way.The Apple Ipod Touch 4G does deliver pretty nicely, while staying siomply in constant like before, unlike the new Ipod Nano, which has made it lose a lot of its shine. The display looks absolutely strong, and simple to its touch like before. What makes this a good upgrade is that it borrows from the Apple Iphone, by now including a camera so you can take pictures with you where ever you roam, which is one of the things that adds a lot of excitement, by bringing in your favorite moments in HD. The other thing that make its strong is the striking ability to playback excellent content from all your favorite music, to now movies and TV shows you can rent from the Itunes shop. But with all of the highs, there are a few lows with the newest Ipod Touch. The first one is that it costs a little more the 8 GB edition, while the 32 and 64 GB versions are still the same in price. The second one is that the battery life can waste away very quickly just like its 3rd Generation model, and that at times, can be a huge fault. Now, that you also have the ability to take photos and home movies, it can need a more constant recharging if you use it frequently.All in all, despite a couple of flaws, Apple still know what it does to make a great Ipod feel even stronger. While the new Ipod Touch improves in extras, it sadly doesn't make that step forward in a few ways. I still overall would recommend the Ipod Touch, but in its 32 GB and 64 GB renditions as a must buy. When it has came down to the Ipod Touch, it shows Apple really does have a strike on the customer, but it could've had more of the touch in fun.Price: B-Media Playback: A-Camera: BBattery Life: B-Overall: B 1/2-
3	1283472000	what a disappointment... i was hoping that the new ipod touch will look like the iphone 4 but with out the phone option. but now that its officially released. it looks just like the old iphone touch with just a camera option. your better off buying the 3rd gen. version. and it will save you lil money also. if you really like the camera option then buy this but other wise.. 3rd gen will do.
4	1283385600	iPod Touch had never included a camera prior to this September 1, 2010 update.The lack of a camera was one of the significant aspects that kept the iPod Touch from feeling more like an iPhone.Now, this iPod Touch has two cameras, reason for celebration?  Not exactly.  The usability of the cameras included is minimal.The iPod Touch does have significant upgrades.  It now features a similar display to iPhone 4, which Apple dubs Retina Display.  It is twice the resolution, and looks oh so gorgeous.  Honestly, I have never used a display that looks as crisp as Apple's Retina Display.  Steve Jobs had described it as looking similar to the text in a high quality book, and I would have to agree.  You must see it, to see the difference.  Therefore, the display in the updated iPod Touch is a significant upgrade.Secondly, the iPod Touch will feel much snappier to you than the previous generation. The reason?  It now includes the same Apple A4 processor that is found in iPhone 4 and iPad.  It's snappy.  Applications launch with much improved speed, multitasking works easier and so forth.  The processor may not make the device look different, but it's a significant feature update.Next, to the cameras.  Both the front and rear camera can be used.  The front camera is similar to the iPhone's front camera, VGA only, which is rather low resolution.  However, Apple knows the front camera would primarily be used for Face Time.  Face Time allows you to make video chats with other iPod Touch (the new ones) and iPhone 4 users.  You must be connected to WiFi to make these video chats.  The Face Time icon is presented prominently on the home screen of the iPod Touch.  I have had access to Face Time for several months, with my iPhone 4.  It is very cool and works surprisingly well.  The problem is finding other users on the compatible device (right now only iPhone 4 and iPod Touch 4th generation) plus them being on WiFi at the same time.  Over time, the feature will be more useful as more members of your family and friends have a compatible device.  However, you simply don't always want to have a video chat with people either.  Sometimes voice or even text is enough.  Therefore, the front camera is not a total bust.  It can be used to try out Face Time, which some users will probably find useful as least on occasion.The rear camera on the iPod Touch is the disappointment.  The rear camera is not even 1 megapixel.  The camera is 960x720 resolution.  Therefore, for still images the quality is quite low.  After all, it's not even 1 megapixel.  The iPhone 4 camera is 5 megapixel.  Is the camera a total bust?  Well, it can take HD video, because HD video is actually lower resolution than still digital cameras.  The quality of the HD video it takes will need to be judged by the user.  The camera's optics are simply not the same as used in the iPhone 4 due to the thinness of the iPod Touch.  Therefore, camera quality is significantly lower compared to iPhone 4.  However, you can take a video and edit it on your iPod Touch.  It probably won't look as good as someone who takes a video on an iPhone 4 though.Overall, I think highly of the new iPod Touch.  The iPod Touch most attractive features are still there, indeed it will do many of its best features, better than ever thanks to the fast A4 processor now included.  Gaming will be quicker and web browsing will be snappier all thanks to its faster processor.  For me, these are uses most buy the Touch to do.  Play games and use it as an internet device for browsing the web or reading email.  The touch is still a winner in these categories.  Highly recommended.  In terms of being a music player, iPod Touch is as great as ever too.  You can continue to touch the screen to select your music and view cover art.  No change there.  40 Hours of Audio Playback.  Video Playback is somewhat improved!  The faster A4 processor allows iTunes HD videos that you purchase to be played, and the retina display makes them look oh so gorgeous.  The cameras are the only small disappointment.  The front camera is ok, but how often will you Face Time?  The back camera's quality and specs are simply not up to the level many have come to expect due to mobile phones' cameras getting better over the years.  However, Apple chose to make the iPod Touch thinner than ever!  That thinness limits the cameras that will fit into the device.The iPod Touch is still a solid value.  Cheaper than an iPhone and with no service contract.  A big plus for many especially teens and kids.  iPod Touch is now as fast as the iPhone and has the gorgeous Retina display that the iPhone features.  It's a winner.  Some may only be disappointed by its cameras.  Still, very much recommended.
2	1283385600	Camera is just simply horrible.back is .7 mega pixels andfront is .3 mega pixels...Nothing different.the ios4 just drains the battery, and nothing rly new except the 2 cameras.Don't buy... you can get 3rd gen for 150 at cragist or w/e don't buy this.. trust me..
3	1283299200	Exact copy of the iphone 4 but without the phone part. Plus same price as when i bought the 2G.
5	1283299200	Finally Steve Jobs got it right! An ipod that is well worth the price for its size and functionality. Wifi with b/g/n, retina display, dual cameras, and a faster processor is more than what we should all expect in this handheld piece of ingenuity. This is my first ipod, or Apple product for that matter, and I am truly pleased by this generation of the ipod series. One year from now, I am sure to sell it to buy a fifth generation, but in the meantime, I am looking forward to using this awesome device.
