5	1405209600	Great little drive with an amazing amount  of storage - fits nicely on a key ring.
5	1405209600	Service was fast and efficient.  I am really pleased with this little jewel so far.  I regularly work from three or four different computers (home, office, school, lab) in my teaching, learning, & taking care of business.  This on my pocket key ring will be so convenient for temporary file transfers...and it looks pretty cool too.  :)
5	1405209600	Very practical. Does the job. Inconspicuous on my keychain. Fast enough for my purposes.
5	1405209600	Great product, very sturdy, and speed is not bad
5	1405123200	Perfect for my Dell tablet and it has regular USB on other side. How clever. Really small and sharp looking.
5	1405123200	I bought this drive to use in my xbox 360 as additional storage it works superbly. it was recognized easily and formatted with no problems.my xbox reads the drive very fast I would recommend it to anyone who wants it for this type of use
5	1405123200	Great design... compact and sturdy. Should be an addition to e erybody's keychain.
4	1405123200	Have yet to use it, but I plugged it into my computer and it fits perfectly.
5	1405123200	If I need another, I will definitely get another one like this one.
5	1405036800	Best price, large capacity, excellent product. I use it all the time.
5	1405036800	I purchased (4) of the &#34;16 GB&#34; Silicon Power and (2) of the &#34;32 GB&#34; Silicon Power USB Drives.  All worked as expected.  Write speeds are faster than the older Attache, PQI and  Kinston drives I own and the Silicon Power Drives are apparently more efficient as they draw less current.  I have an iMac with metered USB slots.  Both the 16 GB and 32 BG Drives draw an idle current of between 50 and 55 mA @ 5.05 Volts.  While writing a 100Mb file the current increases to about 80 to 90 mA.  Well within the safe range for a USB port.  Although the metal case does get warm after copying a large (2.5 GB file).  I'm seeing write rates of around 9 to  10 Mb /second on a 3-year old iMac.  I suspect the speed is being limited by the computer's internal HD.I have some 3 or 4 year old 4 GB USB drives that draw as much as 100mA idling, so these clearly are more efficient.The Drives came formatted as MS-DOS Fat32 volumes with 15.01 GB (&#34;16 GB&#34; size) and 30.05GB (&#34;32 GB&#34; size) usable capacity.So far, I'm completely satisfied with these drives.  Hopefully, they will be reliable.
5	1405036800	I bought five of these. I gave them as gifts and selfishly bought a few extra for myself. They are durable!  I'm an 8th grade teacher and I've lost a great many flash drives in the hallway from breaking off of my key chain.  Nothing is more dismal than wanting to play your video clip from a missing flash drive.  I wanted and needed something that was fast, had lots of storage, and something that would not be lost in the abyss of the mass migration of teenagers. I used this little guy for an entire year and he NEVER ever fell off.  O_o That is saying something!!  Especially when my key chain and flash drive have to avoid the tug of 120 souls each day.  This little guy survived all of that, played all of my educational videos, and did it so swiftly that I never lost the attention of my students.Pros:  Durable, fast, and holds a lot of files.Cons:  No cons...it survived 8th graders for an entire year...not many objects can say that.
5	1405036800	This flash drive is so small and I just love how it looks with its silver base and circular end. It's not bulky and it worked great!I used it to store my recovery from windows and I didnt have any problems. I recommend this flash drive.
5	1405036800	Love these things great design have 5 on my key chain with varying OS's and the 64G one for storing things.
5	1405036800	No cap to lose, small, strong & lots of storage room! Plus circle to attach to any keyring or lanyard so it doesn't get lost = great design!
5	1404950400	Love this drive and it fits well to key ring so I cannot loos it as I did loose a lot already
4	1404950400	A little slow but nothing lost.
5	1404950400	Great design, well made, consistent performance!
4	1404950400	very nice and much smaller that the picture, which makes it fit on keychain even better!stylish too!I will give it 5 stars after a few months to make sure it lasts.
4	1404950400	Love it, my wife loves it!Best way to backup images on the fly. Our phones have 16Gb, but due to the &#34;Library of Congress&#34; of apps my wife carries, this little bugger came in handy, specially when she loves taking video.
5	1404950400	Great little drive for the price.  I image PCs on a near-daily basis.  This is the fatest booting USB 2.0 stick in my collection.  Great metal construction means I don't have to worry that pulling on a lanyard will break anything.
5	1404950400	Perfect For Transportation
5	1404950400	Love the aluminum feature instead of the flimsy, breakable units.
5	1404950400	Came early and works great! T. Hansell
5	1404864000	These USB flash drives are perfect where the attach to a key chain. Unlike other USB drives that are easily lost, the metal housing ensures that this will stay put.
5	1404864000	Copied Video Clips from my computer and put into the side of my TV, Im able to pull us the clips when ever I want to show relives and friends vacation places we have gone. Works great, I have about 28 half hour clips.
5	1404864000	Light, sleek, fast, plenty of space, and inexpensive. Would definitely recommend.
5	1404864000	this product served my purpose well.  It is USB 2.0 and goes onto your key ring; so I can take my storage securely anywhere I go so that its out of harms way with bandits.
5	1404864000	I like the key ring design - exactly what I was looking for. I have a text filed saved on it with my contact information, and it's attached to my keys in case I lose them and someone picks them up.  The silver looks nice and it's pretty small and unobtrusive on my keychain. I also picked it because it is advertised as waterproof - my keys get wet all the time.  So far there has been no damage to the flash drive from rain or other incidental exposure to moisture.  I wouldn't submerge it completely, but so far so good!
5	1404864000	love it love it
5	1404864000	Works well. Promptly shipped.
5	1404864000	Very reliable, no bloatware, and a wonderful design that goes on your keychain vey well. Highly recommended.
5	1404777600	the 64gb flash drive allows me to put alot of movies on it and plug it into my smart tv so i can watch movie after movie without getting up to add more movies.
5	1404777600	Great Product at a great price! And they ship to Guam! :)
5	1404777600	perfect to keep it in the key chain
5	1404777600	I purchased two of these separately.  The first was for myself and it was so good that I had to purchase One for my husband.  I have dropped it, stepped on it wait for it ...WASHED it (though I don't recommend that ) and it still works.  All the guys where I work like it because it looks sleek.  I have over 3,000 pictures on mine and I LOVE IT!  I have been on Amazon for years and I can't even remember when I left a review but this is worth every penny.  TO SILICON POWER  Only 1 problem, this is an award winning design can't you PLEASE make a 3.0 version? Thanks!
4	1404777600	THANKS
5	1404777600	Excellent product - compact, fast and easy to use pull-ring style - terrific for car stereo use.
5	1404777600	Great gadget to have on your keychain!
2	1404691200	Really had some issues with this drive.  It didn't quite fit in ANY of the USB slots of ANY of my computers - I felt like I had to use a little too much force to get it inserted.  And when it was in?  Slow.  VERY SLOW.  I cannot recommend this at all.
5	1404691200	Super small but works great.
5	1404691200	Awesome
5	1404691200	Great for the key chain
5	1404691200	This flashed drive worked great from the start, I am very pleased with it. I plan to buy another soon, the price is good and the product is superb.
5	1404691200	Very nice thumb drive , metal construction . Great for keychain , good seller
4	1404691200	It did it's job! It will bend slightly if you keep it in your back pocket (Still usable). Beside from the VERY slow transfer rate, it's pretty good for the price.
5	1404604800	I have been using silicon power 32gb for some days now and I will say it met my expectations. Keep it up silicon
5	1404604800	Excelent
5	1404604800	This flash drive is perfect for what I was looking for. I always lose my flash drives, so I needed something that would have a built in key chain piece. When it arrived, it was exactly what I was looking for.The stick itself is very well made, it does not feel cheap and is very durable. I've had mine for a few months now and there isn't a single scratch on it. It's big enough to easily put it in and out of your computer, but not too big so that it overwhelms your Keychain.For the price, this flash drive is very well worth it. It does everything it says in the description, it's a quick transfer to and from the computer, as I'm constantly transferring large files. If you're looking for a good flash drive to keep on your Keychain, this is exactly what you need.
5	1404604800	Ultra thin.
5	1404518400	I bought the 64GB aluminum keychain version.  It was physically smaller than I expected, which is a good thing.  Plays well with my car keys and does not seem obtrusive in use.  Seems very sturdy.  Does get pretty warm.  It is about as perfect a form for a portable USB drive that my limited imagination can conceive of.  I plan on buying another one for my other set of keys.
5	1404518400	It shopped quickly. The drive is compact and sturdy. It is a good deal.
5	1404518400	Everything I expected and more. It is so easy to use and small. My only concern, not that I've had any issues, but it gets pretty hot. But I'd still recommend it to any tablet user if they need more data storage.
5	1404432000	All pros, no negatives. (sure, it's a bit slow for the times, but it's to be expected--it's USB 2.0 and a thin package, not USB 3.0)8GB, Stainless steel encapsulated, solid all around--no seam, big ring.Speeds are about 5 MB/s write, 15 MB/s reads--not fancy but ok for USB 2.0 thin package drive.If speeds are not important to you but durability, exclusivity, extreme conveneince is, then go for it.It is one of the best USB sticks on the market for it's intended qualifications.
5	1404432000	Great product and service, works perfect, original product, packaged well and delivered right on time as specified, can't fault anything in fact I might buy another USB, as the size and quality is excellent
5	1404432000	This came in a small package and I bought this one given I've never heard of the brand over the similar Kingston because it was cheaper and it looked better this one also claimed to be waterproof and more durable. I don't know if this one will Last any longer than my knock off LaCie key that lasted about a year. I have to format this drive a certain way with two partitions one hidden to windows computers that is bootable and can boot several PC repair tools and the other the active partition used for my files like any other flash drive. This allows me to use my flash drive without have a bunch of weird files on the same drive because it is split into two drives digitally. This worked fine with this drive it was just difficult figuring out how I achieved the intended result.
5	1404432000	Bought this to store MP3 music files. Fit's on my key chain and does the job.
5	1404432000	LOVE IT WISH I BOUGHT MORE, THE METAL CONSTRUCTION IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER PLASTIC JUNK OUT THERE
5	1404432000	32GB for less then $16 can't beat it. The Drive is well made, connects to PC and My Car Audio USB Port with no hiccup.I was going to order Kingston Drive first but Silicon Power slim round end design was the reason for going with this drive. Kingston Drive is just too Thick and too small to grab. Design for handling the drive is much better then others.
4	1404432000	Love the small, stylish form factor.  Works as expected.
2	1404432000	It didn't work even for two days before failing, could not be recognized
5	1404345600	Works as a USB flash should but the aluminium case sets it a part from othesr I have owned with plastic cases that break.
4	1404345600	It is not 64 gig but 60 gig so it has 1.5 gig more than the Kingston but it is a little bigger than the Kingston and I did not see a  warranty on it.
5	1404345600	Excellent form factor, high build quality, and does the job as intended for a decent price. The read/write speeds could be a bit quicker, but its nothing to be unhappy with.
4	1404345600	Nice and small and tough!  The only problem is that the &#34;o&#34; part is wide, so it's hard to plug it in a USB slot next to another cord stuck in an adjacent USB slot.  In other words, it doesn't like side-by-side USB such as you might find on the front of a desktop computer.  For most people who will be sticking this in the side of a laptop, it's just fine.
5	1404345600	Works great, and I don't have to worry about it breaking like the plastic ones.
5	1404259200	Bought it for one of my blu ray players, looks sleek and modern,  will purchase another for one of my other blu ray players as well
5	1404259200	Exactly what I needed!
4	1404259200	Pros: It works. It's small. It fits USB and mini-UB, making it very versatile.Cons: Cap only fits mini-end, so you have to keep track of it. It would have been cooler to flip it over and put it on the other end.Minor gripe: I ordered gold and got silver.
5	1404259200	Brillaint
1	1404259200	Worthless.Used as my keychain flash drive, but stoped working after 6 months. Got back to my cheap-n-old flash drive bought at eBay that has lasted for more than 2 years - and still in use.
4	1404259200	Works great. Nice slim design
5	1404259200	Very durable flashdrive with a nice look and a great price.The quality of the aluminum is so nice, especially for the price! The flashdrive is great to play around in your hand and it can also be hooked up to a lanyard or ring.
4	1404259200	Really small.  Put it in my key chain and can't even tell it's there.  Really cool looking too.
5	1404259200	Just got a thank you and request from SP  to submit an evaluation of their 64 GB Flash Drive.Given the speed of delivery and a follow up letter checking to see if I was happy, the outfit itself seems first rate.The excellence of this flash drive will be no surprise to anyone looking at the star count and general adulation in almost all reviews.My personal responses are three:Designers: This flash drive is  beautiful and I wonder why Apple hasn't bought your company.Engineers and Programmers:The set-up was hardly that. Stuck it in a USB port and it appeared on  the screen.  I threw some files in it and opened them later without a hitch. Mightily impressed since I expected a bit of a hassle.Packagers: People, please do not offer the chance to win an iPad on a tag that leaves so much gunk that the code can't be scanned.But then again, we're a two iPad household already--and it feels good to just wish a reader of this review good luck in the contest.
5	1404259200	Perfect
4	1404172800	High quality, but very slow.
3	1404172800	Works well, but very hard to extract from a USB port on a computer,  Fit is very tight, and there is no way to grip this well to pull it out of the computer.
5	1404172800	Who would have thought?  A flash drive that easily plugs into bottom plug of my HTC One or Galaxy and allows me to move files between phones or phones and computer very quickly and easily.  The capacity is more than enough and we were able to move a ton of songs between my computer and phone in a very short period of time that I would not have been able to do any other way in a practical manner.  Great product.
5	1404172800	Great USB! Great price! Excellent for saving numerous files, especially music files. And it fits right onto your keychain. Perfect!
5	1404086400	I was able to back up 2 pcs to this and that is great.  I slipped this on my key chain so I can back up daily without forgetting!
5	1404086400	Smaller than it seems from the pictures on Amazon, and very sleek.  Inserts easily into the interior of the USB port.
5	1404086400	no problem at all, works perfectly and love the simplicity of the design, theres only 30gb usable, but this is normal i guess
5	1404000000	Great!  Fast enough and slim on your keychain.  I'm very happy with this flash drive.
5	1404000000	So far, so good. I especially like the slightly larger size and the sturdy feel of the grip portion of the drive.
4	1404000000	I wear this on a lanyard with my access/identity card for work and the weight and size are perfect - pretty much the same size/shape/weight of a key.It is not the fastest out there however so if you're looking for fast transfer - I'd go with something else.  Otherwise a good deal for the price and very useful without being obtrusive.
5	1404000000	In 1987 I bought a 100 MB 3-1/2 hard drive for $1100.00. Really! I was emphatically told it was far, far too big!Now, here is this drive. In about the same space as that 100MB drive, 500 of these fit! Likely more.Then it holds 640 times that first drive. The same space with the old drive would cost $704,000.00!Gotta appreciate technology.
5	1404000000	not much you can say about something like this - apart from it fits well on my key ring and works just like a ....usb drive which is what it should do.
5	1404000000	This flash drive stays attached to my key chain, which gets beat and banged around all day at work. I've never had any problems with it, and I will continue to trust Silicon Power products in the future.
1	1404000000	This thing worked great! I had all kinds of good info on it for that reason. After a couple of months I took it to a presentation that I was giving, plugged it in and ... nothing! I checked for lint, but it was worse than that. The insides fell out and I was left with an empty case. It looks cool, but does absolutely nothing. Up until that point it would have gotten 5 stars. Because all of my info is in the gutter somewhere and the fact that I almost looked like an ass at my briefing (I carry 2 thumb drives for briefings just in case) it gets 1 star. Once the problem keeping the insides on the inside is addressed it will get 5.
5	1404000000	Sleek durable attractive affordable high tech gear that never gets misplaced. So much space good looks and easily transported by using on my key ring. Why didn't I get this sooner. What are you waiting for? These should be engraved with a business logo and made part of the welcome to the company gift pack from HR. Or gift for anyone EVERYONE needs this!
5	1403913600	Due to the unique nature of my business, I use a great number of flash drives. So far, I've purchased 20 of these Silicon Power 64 GB flash drives, and they've performed perfectly. And I love the simple but elegant design.
1	1403913600	The USB flash split from the metal cover know i have a metal cover without USB memorySherif mostafaSherophone@yahoo.com
5	1403913600	Simple, functional and great price. Fits on a key chain perfectly.and almost can wear as a ring. 64gb is the way to go.
5	1403913600	A really cool design and it's as good or better than any of the other jump drives I have.Just plug it in and go!! I plan on getting a few more of them...
1	1403913600	Have to force it into the usb slot. It is a pain to use because it doesn't fit right.  Disappointed for sure.
5	1403913600	HOLDS LOTS OF FILES, i love this flash drive. its a matter a fact - i am going to order another one right now
5	1403913600	The metal case and loop on the flash drive is a plus. The loop makes the drive easy to secure and keep safe.
5	1403913600	Not much more to say than what's in the header. The SP 64GB drive is everything I require in a flash drive.  It's a solid one piece metal unit, not wrapped in a plastic shell.  I've had other plastic flash drives that crack or chip.  The ring on the end makes it easier to pull out of the USB port.To test it out, I transferred a 210 GB file in about 10 seconds.  I was going to reformat to NTFS but now I don't think that is necessary.  The capless design makes it a bit smaller than other drives such as the Sandisk Titanium Cruiser.  That's easy to get used to, though.I would recommend this drive to anyone.
1	1403827200	Couldn't format it in Windows so I got the utility from their website. It said it was formatted but Windows said I had 0 bytes left. Tried it a few more times and then it wasn't recognized at all when I plugged it in. Sent it back.
5	1403740800	On first glance I was impressed with the sturdy build.  It has lived on my keychain for a week and I'm impressed with the design as much as the function.Read / write speeds have been impressive - even on USB 2.0 ports it has performed well.
1	1403654400	The good:  Nice Metallic frame.  Easy to plug into UsB slotThe Bad & Ugly:  Unfortunately the Stick died and was unrecoverable only after about 10 uses.  It was a backup USB drive so my back up is gone.  Fortunately my original data is intact.  I will not be purchasing from this company again.
5	1403654400	this is a quality brand and product. i wanted something durable and dependable and silicon power has both of those. it is also fast (3.0) and is small enough for me to tuck away. this is no doubt my most trusted brand in computer accessories.
3	1403568000	I bought 3 of these to use at work.  I needed a durable flash drive that I could put on my keychain.  The all metal design and key loop make it great for that purpose, and it's smaller than most of the keys on my keychain.I set this drive up to be bootable and I use it to load operating system images.  I gave it three stars because after performing 2-3 system images, the drive all of a sudden stops booting successfully.  Imaging a hard drive is a read-only operation, so it should not ever cause data corruption.  Nevertheless, one of the 3 drives I bought always becomes corrupted after I've used it a handful of times.  I can reload the system image files and it works fine again for a few tries, but eventually stops working again and I can no longer boot to the drive as needed to perform system images.
5	1403568000	Size is small enough to comfortably add to a keyring and the aluminum exterior is durable enough that I do not worry about it getting damaged in my pocket.
5	1403481600	I received this flash Drive a few days ago and I must say that I have absolutely no problem with it. It does what it is supposed to do from the word go. I have no problem recommending this to anyone.
5	1403481600	This is a Great Silicon Power 64 GB Firma ZN F80 USB 2.0 Flash Drive..  Even came in Gary Aluminium. (My favorite Aluminum)  This has the exact right about of GB.  I was looking for 64 and this gave me 64. I also like the round circle that comes on the end. This is great for carrying around on my pinkie. Also, I am impressed with the timing of the review email. It is great to receive this email 5 or 6 days after I receive the product. That gives me adequate time to receive the product.  The drive is  great for copying files from one computer over to a second computer.  If you need to do something similar, I recommend this drive.  Thanks Amazon Prime. I love your two day shipping.
5	1403481600	I purchased this product more to get an idea of the construction material rather than the functionality but decided to go with a 64gb just in case I was thrilled with it. I AM THRILLED WITH IT. material feels solid and looks to be well built. I have received many complements on the drive.
5	1403481600	Son needed a flash drive for his xbox 360 and this one worked great.  Size was great and the loop on the end made it very convenient.
3	1403395200	Good looking flash-drive. Very small and light. Write speed is about 8MB/s. Good value at $7. The "Blaze B30" (USB 3) line from this company is a better value and much better speed.-Chris
3	1403395200	The loop is thicker than shown and not easy to fit on key chain, and it's only USB 2.0.  Wish I had known more when I bought it  It does however, carry material well, and even though I have dropped it or messed with it by accident, it works.
5	1403395200	I do professional wedding photography. Switching all dvd photo storage to this for customers now. They match my &#34;O&#34; logo style and colors for outoftheordinary.biz very well and look nice until I decide on custom design ones. They work nice, sturdy, plug in well, store a good amount, no complaints. Thanks!
4	1403395200	I like it. I purchased the 16GB. Liked it some much bought the 32 GB.Will buy more. I consider a good buy.
5	1403308800	64GB for $25 is a pretty good deal in my book...worked fine, ring makes it easy to get out of the computer, shipped fast, I'm happy. Aluminum housing feels nice and sturdy, too. I don't think I'd use the ring to put it on my keys, though, since there is no cap.
5	1403308800	This drive is low profile, looks great, has high capacity, and is much faster than the previous name other brand flash drives that I had previously purchased. I have now bought a second one of these drives.  I highly recommend this drive and will probably buy another one when I am ready for a new drive.  The cost per GB was also very competitive with other quality drives.
5	1403222400	I love the size of the flash drive, I have on my key ring. I don't even realize its there. I can carry much data with me because of the 32GB storage space. Excellent design and storage space. Very pleased with product.
5	1403222400	very slim, sturdy and works like a charm.  It would not be overbearing on a key chain at all.  It is slightly smaller than a key.
3	1403222400	Had it for 2 month. Works, but slow.Pro : Like the aluminium casing. Carried it with the car key, so I would not lost it.Con: too slow for writing and reading.
5	1403222400	Very good one. Though nowadays we don't use USB drive too often, but carrying one with you can always handle the emergency use at cases. This one is small enough to be not noticeable on key chain. Solid enough to survival under other metal keys attach. I just love it.
5	1403136000	What led me to choose this particular flash drive is the sturdy metal construction and sleek design. I have had problems in the past with them breaking off in my computer or being damaged from other meens. The all metal prevents any impact damage and full metal loop is perfect for wearing it as necklace or adding several to a key loop like I do. As a DJ and gamer i like to use them to carry game data and music around with me so these are perfect. There is one thing I don't like so much about these are that they all lack a place to make a label or mark what you may have on the drives. I have many all looking the same so labeling is important. On the upperside the all metal construction allowed me to engrave directly on the housing..though it is permenant I would like to see changeable labels that can me added.
5	1403136000	Perfect size and great to have accessible for security reasons.Waterproof, the metal shell is sturdy as well, overall performance is great also
4	1403136000	There are a few mildly annoying thing about this flash drive, I really needed to wiggle it to get the drive into the usb port properly. I also noticed when I looked at its properties that the drive appeared to only have 30GB of space, not 32. Also it does get a little warm after it was in the port for 2 or 3 hours but definitely not too hot to touch, it was really only a little warm. None of this was really a big problem, just a little annoying.Besides that I really liked it, it is very small and feels sturdy and well made. It copied files onto the drive reasonably quickly. Overall a small drive with lots of space for its price.
1	1403049600	I bought this one on december 2013, because I already have a flash drive from this manufacturer... this one is a real waste of money: the first issue is about that the device is too slow, comapared to the same drive, but 32Gb...and the worst part: it died, after few months of use... very disappointing...
1	1403049600	When I try to move files larger than 3GB, I get an error message telling me that the drive is full.  I'm guessing I got a defective unit, so I got a refund and will probably just go buy something at Staples.Has anyone else had this problem??
5	1403049600	Very pleased with this product.  I plugged it in my laptop and the drivers were automatically loaded and I could backup my files.  I highly recommend it.
5	1403049600	AAA+++Excellent product great for office school and home we bought sevetal for everyone in the fanily I recommend these
5	1402963200	After losing my last USB flash drive because it worked its way off my key chain I wanted a replacement that would never let go. This flash drive is small, well made and stylish. I would definitely recommend this product.
5	1402963200	I bought this because I needed to transfer a ton of data from an old computer to new one. This seemed like the fastest and most economical way to do it. I plugged it in, it set up on its own and notified me it was ready to work. I sent entire directories into this and got them transferred exactly as they were on the old unit. I like the open ring on this. I keep it on a key ring with my VPN fob. Copying took quite a bit of time but it did all fit on this device. I had about 32GB and just let it go. I actually don't remember how long it took but my expectation was an afternoon and it did better than that. I have to say I'm very impressed to get that much storage in such a little device. I have noticed no problems with drive at all and feel comfortable recommending it.
5	1402963200	Pros:- Actually has MORE than 32gb worth of useable space (it is like 32.24 or something but that is a rare thing in the world of memory)- Looks great- Fits very well on a keychain- Appears like it will be a great fit for that little thing I need to twist on my Apple Bluetooth trackpad to get the batteries outCons:- Finish does appear like it is going to wear a little, but I think it will look fine (I can be a bit obsessive...)- Isn't USB 3.0 (this is admittedly a bit unfair of a criticism since I knew that along with it also not being wireless or a thunderbolt but I thought just having 1 con seemed unbalanced...)So, I was hesitant about getting this over the more established Kingston brand of this since this is more expensive and slightly larger, physically. However, some guy made an argument about the size of the hole being more conducive to actually being on a keychain and I bit. I don't consider flash memory a terribly high-tech thing, so I am not really worried about this drive breaking over the next couple of years. In fact, in 2002 my friend got a USB drive (16mb) and put it through the washing machine and it worked great the next day as well, so, I don't consider a drive being &#34;water resistant&#34; an additional feature.BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAHIt is a perfectly good drive, and since I consider showing up to the job 93% of what is necessary to be successful, this being attached to my keychain is a step in the right direction.RECOMMENDED.
1	1402963200	Ordered 2 of the 16gb, both are dead after 5 months of lite useage.  Dead here means that write speed has dropped to less than 1MB/s and read is not much better.
5	1402963200	I bought this because I have so many that are flimsy. I keep it on my key chain and is holding up nicely.
5	1402963200	great looking product easy to transport and store.  A tight fit into the USB port helps guarantee a continuous connection.
4	1402963200	I bouth 2 of these because I was fed up with SanDisk Cruzer's Facet crapping out on me all the time (the plastic ones with sort of diamond-like texture to it. DO NOT BUY THAT MODEL, worst data storage ever). I'm too scared to test the water and dirt resistance on these Silicons, but I'm pretty rough with my stuff and it's held up very well so far.  Fast data transfers. Gets pretty hot while in use. Works fine with MacBook Pro. Super small size, and almost adds no bulk to a keyring. Great to always keep essential files on hand without bulging pockets.
2	1402963200	loved it when it came looks cool and has a very tight fit only problem I cant use it in my car stereo I get an error-23 message  I bought it to use in my car so i guess ill go back to 32 gigDAMN this sucks
5	1402963200	Great product well built easy to carry....overall great price,.will definitely recommend to others to buy it or check it out.
4	1402876800	i have just transferred files from a drive to this larger capacity one.seems fine for my basic needs.....try it out yourself..
1	1402876800	I was very excited to get this... until it arrived, and I found that it was nothing but an empty metal shell.  I'm sure this was just a manufacturing error, but I'm still stuck with a completely worthless piece of merchandise.
1	1402876800	This drive was hard to fit into my USB port and, once in, did not work at all.  Promptly returned for a refund.
4	1402876800	Seems to work fine, just wish it had a cap.  I like the ring though, you can tie a string or label to it.
5	1402790400	This unique shape looks good on my key chain, plus works like it's supposed to.  I like it gives you more to hold on to when putting into computer
5	1402790400	I really like this little thing (and it really is quite small.)  It's the perfect thing to put on a key-chain and it's fantastically fast.  If you don't already have one a flash drive like this, or are looking to replace an old one, it's definitely the thing to buy.
5	1402790400	The slim profile of this drive works wonderfully with my ultrabook, no unecessary bulk to contend with. The large capacity has more than adequate room for any files, documents or programs i need to have with me.The design is great the all aluminium casing acts as a heat sink to dissapate heat away and protect the memory chip itself, I've had the problem of excess heat destroying a plastic-enclosed USB Drive before, this would not be the case here. The loop is great for carrying around on a key ring, but I keep it the zippered coin pouch of my wallet, an added benefit of the slim profile. Overall, I'm completely pleased with my purchase and I hope to be using it for years to come.
5	1402704000	smaller then i expected. i'll have to get a cord for this cause i might lose it or it'll be hard to find in the bottom of the bag. looks great, fells great, works great.
5	1402704000	No problem with usb stick. Read and write speed is fast. Great size/capacity to give away to client.FIY: It's smaller than it look. It's roughly slightly bigger than 1&#34; in length. I thought it was more like 2-3 inches.I hope they're releasing usb 3.0 version of these soon.
5	1402704000	Fits on the clip I keep on my laptop sleeve and looks pretty cute, too. I've gotten few compliments on the aesthetics of this thing. Everything loads quickly and it slides in and our of ports with ease. 10/10 would buy again.
4	1402704000	Love this product:) first time useing AMAZON !!Love it ;)  I bought few items and I love it !! I recomend it to my freinds all the time;)
5	1402704000	This is extremely sturdy and well built. I even bought a second one to give away! It is very high quality and made in Taiwan.
5	1402704000	Nice size drive for the price - works great, it's slim and feels sturdy.  I do wish there was some type of cover to keep dust / pocket lint out of the housing, but other than that no complaints here.
4	1402704000	I am happy with this so far although I haven't used it a lot.  I've been loading MP4 copies of my travel slide shows onto it and then playing them back on my television.  The pictures are sharp and the colors vivid.  I would have given it 5 stars but I'm a little concerned because it gets pretty warm while it's working.  This may be natural, but it does concern me a little.
5	1402704000	I needed a replacement for en earlier &#34;key&#34; - and this one surpassed it. Sleek and elegant, very convenient with (for my purposes) large capacity.
5	1402617600	Will buy more...Better than competition/Cheaper...All reviews positive, fast, nice design, easy to remove, solid.That's all I can say.
4	1402617600	Have had this flash drive on my keys for months now and it isn't showing any signs of damage or wear. The only negative aspect is that the USB 2.0 speeds are too slow for larger files. A decent 3.0 version of this same drive would get 6 out of 5 stars from me.
5	1402617600	I love this USB drive.  It's not only sturdy, it's beautifully designed.  People had already asked me about this little USB drive that is attached to my key chain and, naturally, I refer them to Amazon.com!
2	1402617600	Had to reformat to NTFS twice.... Has a cheap feel to itGuess you get what you pay for.: (
5	1402531200	This was just what I was looking for in a keychain style usb drive.  Small with a large key ring! Not much else to say about it....it does what it was designed for...very portable file storage.
4	1402531200	This is the tiniest usb made.  It physically could not be smaller because the USB has to fit in the port.  Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  4 stars because it's small so it's  hard to pull out and it doesn't have a cover for the larger side.
4	1402444800	Great device to keep on keychain, barely tell it's there and very handy. Sturdy and very well made, recommended for sure.
4	1402444800	This is a nice looking little flash drive but the speed could be a little faster.  My 6 year old SanDisk Cruzer is faster at writing files.  It gets hot when transferring files, which is understandable given the aluminium build.  Given the prize and the size of the drive, it is still worth it if you are not hard pressed on speed.
5	1402444800	I got the 64 GB drive for less than $25. This price is hard to beat. Not only that, put it does not look cheap like all those other plastic USB drives everywhere else. There is a reason why this received the red dot design award. Brushed metal looks and feels great. Also, the bigger ring makes it easier to unplug the device from a USB port. This drive is shorter than the &#34;regular&#34; house key.I only have one &#34;key&#34;, and this is it. Looks great with my car key fob, since i don't really carry any keys with me.Photo (Amazon) &#8595;&#8595;&#8595;&#8594; http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo3CG8C4DLPJX4D/B00A35X1BMVERDICT: I highly recommend this product.&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; 5 Stars for being well designed and priced inexpensive.
5	1402358400	I really like the design of These - really easy to keep on a key ring (all together). I have bought several to backup my pictures and keep organized.
5	1402358400	I carry this thing on my key chain and I always have a mammoth amount of USB storage with me. The design (with the ring) has made a tremendous amount of difference. I used to carry thumb drives in my pocket, but never seemed to have one when I truly needed it. By placing this monster on my key chain, it's always there. It works great, it's accessible, it's handy, and it even feels/looks good. The only thing I would mention (something that's not an issue for me, but might be for some) is that there's no &#34;cover&#34; or sleeve on the open-USB end. If you are worried about contamination or have issue with an &#34;open&#34; USB port on you data stick (and don't have a way to provide this independently), then maybe you should look for a stick that has such protection built in. However, I've carried mine &#34;open&#34; for a very long time and have never had an issue with contaminants (dust, lint, pocket-crud, etc.) in the interface. I highly recommend this thumb drive. I'm looking forward to a USB 3.0 version and will buy it as soon as I can.
5	1402358400	Flash drive seems to be plenty fast enough (decent read/write speeds).  The all aluminum case seems very durable and should withstand plenty of punishment.  This unit would be good for situations that could potentially damage plastic USB flash drives.  There is no cover for the USB port (not many flash drives have those anymore though) so pocket lent might get it if stored in a pocket, otherwise it is a very solid product.  I would (and probably will) purchase again in the future.
5	1402272000	I picked this up to put the OS X Mavericks installer on, along with some other important files I might need in emergencies or as second backups. I formatted this easily as a GUID partition type and put the Mavericks installer file on it through Terminal. I used it to put Mavericks on a new drive for a mid-2009 MBPro and it worked great. I have some other files on it as well. Only drawback is that writing to it is a bit slow, but that is normal based on chipsets and compatibility. It may be a lot faster on newer macs or pc's but I'm not sure. It is very small with a a great keyring design. It has been in the usb port for several days and is very unobtrusive. I wouldn't store it that way or anything but it juts out minimally.
5	1402185600	I personally don't usually write reviews but I love this item. I'm pretty rough on equipment. Being an IT professional and running my own business make it doubly dangerous. This item is on my key chain and has been through it all.
5	1402185600	Usually I loose my USB flash drives... This one is small and strong enough to be carried with my keys. Love it!
5	1402185600	just wow ..... This is really good flash drive to carry in key chain, also too light and work perfectly
5	1402099200	It is very sturdy.  I have used this for nearly a year and there is barely a scratch on it.  It uploads/downloads pretty quickly.  I'm happy with it.
5	1402099200	Nice design , sturdy works wellI'll purchase another.Have added and deleted large files from the USB storage without any problems.
5	1402099200	I had another jump drive that was on my key ring and I lost it, and I wanted to find one that would replace it and I wanted to make absolutely sure it would not come off my keys.  So I got this one, and this is great.  It is tough, rigid, and there is no way this is falling off my keys. It is a little smaller then I thought it would be, but this thing is great, plus its 32 gigs.  I remember buying a 4 gig about 6 years ago at this price, and now I have 32, which is more than enough space to hold large files like videos.
5	1402012800	very sleek device and small enough to go on a keychain.functional and surprisingly sturdy. So far the performance has been great
5	1402012800	It is now June 2014 and can say this flash drive has exceeded all of my expectations.  I use the flash drive on a daily basis and have experienced ZERO problems with it.  Well, not zero problems.  There have been a few occasions where I have left my house keys in the USB drive of my office computer.  ;)
5	1402012800	This is exactly what I have been looking for. Smallest flash drive otg. It is really neat. Quality build. But it gets hot easily. Transfer & read is acceptable. Not the fastest but yeah. It's good enough since the size of this thing covers up that. Careful not to lose it though because i can't really emphasize it enough as this otg is really the smallest you can find right now on the market.
5	1402012800	Awesome. I use these and bought one for my sister, father and friends.  Small and fits nice on a keychain and its not made out of plastic so its durible.
5	1401926400	This drive disappears on a key-chain. Very handy and fast. My only concern is the aluminum body gets very warm if I leave it in my laptop for an extended period, hot to the touch actually. Not an issue if you don't leave it connected.
5	1401926400	I have this on my keychain. It blends in nicely, I almost forget that it's there. The contact area is covered preventing other keys and items from scratching or damaging it. Great size to stash quick files on or to grab a slide deck from a presenter when at a conference.
4	1401926400	High-capacity and durable key-shaped thumb drive, practical for everyday use.I usually use it on occasion at school but it can be useful when you least expect it.
3	1401840000	Works great, but the housing around the connector is tight and is tough to get into a USB port. Over time I foresee the housing getting bent to the point where I will not be able to fit it into the slot.Other than that, fast delivery and good communications from the seller.
1	1401840000	Got this to replace a 16 GB drive that basically fell apart.  I liked the solid, one piece metal construction.  However, randomly, it just stopped working.  I was interacting with a file on my PS3, finished with the file, removed the flash drive, inserted it into my computer, and nothing happened.  I re-inserted it into my PS3 and again, nothing happened.  It was like the last time I removed the drive from the PS3 the dang thing it developed total amnesia.  Not even amnesia- it's completely non-existent.  No system or drive will recognize that it's even plugged in.  The one that fell apart is still working better than this one did!
4	1401840000	My back-up's back-up. Having lost all my HD once, I now use flash drives to back-up my separate HD in the manner I used to use rewritable discs. Much more convenient. 64GB is far too big, but then, why not - at the price?
5	1401840000	Works, fits the port properly, hard metal, durable, slender design and will fit on the key chain securely and unnoticed. Lightweight too. Went to the SP website and activated the warranty for this product. The website address is inside the product packaging under the product.
5	1401840000	This flash drive is small but not too small; the enlarged ring at the end works well for attaching to a key ring but also makes it much easier than many small flash drives to hold for insertion and removal.
4	1401840000	Looks way cool!!  And it fits nicely on my key ring with no chance of it falling off.Works as promised.
5	1401840000	It is very smart and pretty. It much smaller then I thought. Very convenient to carry with me. It is valuable!
5	1401753600	Never enjoyed having something like this as small as it is and having the memory download all sorts of data...Music, Movies and then to be able to just drop it into my pocket and go.  It's like having a whole computer in my pocket...Glad I made the purchase...Love it.
5	1401753600	Very durable and compact at the price paid it was very worth it. There really isn't much to say about it beyond that.
5	1401753600	It gets super HOT! This is really strange. I have many other mini cards same size or larger that NEVER have had a heat issue. I know heat is a normal characteristic in electronic devices meaning they are operating as designed but this is crazy hot. I hope it does not fail over time due to the heat it generates.
2	1401753600	This flash drive gets burning hot when plugged into my Macbook Pro.  It also seems to read very slowly as a result.  It seems to act as a heat sink.  Otherwise, the ring is helpful for clipping onto a keychain hook in my bag, but that's about it.
5	1401667200	It looks way bigger than it actually is, it works in its favor, very portable and pretty. Would buy again
4	1401667200	The lack of dust cover means you'll need to be careful what else you keep in your pocket with it. Memory is a tad slow. Even smaller than it appears - though sadly, also not quite as tough as it appears - the aluminum is a tad flimsy compared to some of the Lacie keychain memory sticks. Still, it does the job, and was an excellent buy for the price.
5	1401667200	build quality seems good.  fits nicely on a key ring with just the right amount of weight so you know its there.  read/write performance is average.  Good for carrying around drivers, software, and troubleshooting tools for me the computer repair guy.
4	1401667200	Absolutely stunning piece of hardware. Easy to move around with, I attached it to my key chain and I always get questions about it.
4	1401667200	Very Small and strong Pen drive.. But the security software didn't come inclued. When you donwload it at the page it's really poor... I was waiting a secure flash drive...
5	1401667200	Not much you can say about a flash drive. Nice sleek design. sometimes a little difficult to put in the socket. Plenty of storage for all my needs. Easy to install, just plug it in and the computer does the rest.
5	1401580800	These are the coolest little flash drives.  If they don't catch on and become the next must-have memory device, I don't know what the rest of the world is thinking.  Definitely give them as stocking stuffers or just because.  If I got one as a gift, I would die of happiness.  I think I just did.Why are they so special?  Because not only can I use them as a regular thumb drive (they are very tiny, the length of a half dollar and nowhere near as wide), they can be used as flash drives on the micro USB ports of Android phones and tablets.  I used them to transfer data on my HTC One and generic Android tablet.  It's so much easier to use a flash drive than digging out the microSD card.The drawback: the drive comes with a cap with a slot, presumably for us to string a lanyard through.  If we put a lanyard through there, we would end up with a cap and no drive.  The cap falls off too easily.  When I insert into a regular USB port and then try to remove it, I end up yanking off the cap and not the drive.  It's a small drive, not much to grip.  (Don't worry, the flash drive will come out without much trouble after the cap comes off.)  I would like to see a lanyard slot somewhere on the body of the flash drive and not the cap.That's just a little ole cap.  The product is a winner.  I could kiss the person who invented it.  Because of him/her, life is easier.  I only wish the flash drive worked with my Kindle Fire HD.  It doesn't, or maybe it does.  I just can't find a way to access it.  ES File isn't doing it for me.This product was provided for review by Silicon Power.
5	1401580800	I just used this to make a recovery drive for my laptop.  Works great and is durable and waterproof. Satisfied
5	1401580800	For the price this flash drive is well worth it. design is very nice and feels well built and sturdy. Data speeds are good. Would recommend this product
5	1401494400	It works. But I suppose that if there's a flash drive being sold that didn't, it wouldn't do well. I haven't had it long, so I can't say much for the drive's long term duribility, but the metal casing with no moving parts seems solid and like it will hold up well.
4	1401494400	I purchased three of these for my wife and 2 daughters. They aren't as fast as some of the more exspensive ones but these work fine for simple file trasfers from and to their tablets. I tested them on HD Tune and transfer rate min.- 21.5 mb/s, max.- 26.9 mb/s, with an avg. Of 26.3 mb/s. Access time o.5 ms, burst rate 23.o mb/s & cpu usage was -1.0%. Overall for the money i'm very pleased and yes I will recommed this product.
5	1401494400	Hard to believe that these tiny things can hold so much data.  Perfect on a keychain.NOTE: extremely tight fit so don't give up.
5	1401494400	I am real happy with this flash drive, it is so simple I did not understand how it worked at first. I figured it out, just plug it in. hard to believe they can get that much storage u in a small package.
5	1401408000	I was surrprised about the quick delivery.It's unexpected, pleasant surprise and it was more like a great gift for me.I would like to say &#34;Thank you&#34; and wish your business to be great with God's blessing.Again, thank you very much for the quick delivery.
5	1401408000	I have 2 of the gray 32 gig 2.0 flash drives. I loaded about 6 gigs of back up files onto one and the other has has not been opened.the actual space on the drive is 30 gig. the feel of the device is pretty impressive, quite small and light but gives the impression of quality.  others have claimed that their flash drives failed so I will have to come back and report if things go wrong but as of right now I do not expect them to. after a 6 gig dump into it, I noticed NO HEAT issues. I had it plugged in for several hours manually finding files and dragging them over.  no issues at all.I would need to use them in long term to decide if I would recommend this to a friend or give as a gift. for the price I got them at,  I think I got a deal.
4	1401408000	This device is a lot smaller than I thought it would be which is great! The build quality of the flash drive appears to be good. Really simple and elegant and won't add too much bulk to my keychain!
5	1401408000	Perfect for keeping on a key-chain/caribeaner.Even though it doesn't have a cap I've had mine for over a year now and no problems, sturdy build.Have also had no problems transferring files from and to it.Perfect little flashdrive for me.
1	1401408000	I needed a 64 gb memory stick.  Purchased this and thought it was great, till I looked at the properties on the computer and found it's only a 29gb flash drive!! NOT A 64 GB!  However the stick and package clearly claim it's a 64 gb!  That's clearly a lie!  Do not waste your money!
5	1401408000	Perfect for loading up with videos to watch on a DVD with a USB port... or laptop. Lightweight and cool looking to boot.
5	1401321600	I ordered this flash drive because I wanted a tiny-yet-tough flash drive to keep on my keyring. This drive fits the bill perfectly: it is very compact and the outer casing is a single piece of metal. This drive has 0 moving parts, which is a plus for its longevity.I have not tested performance, but based on moving around small files, it seems to be reasonably quick.
5	1401321600	I received this speaker sound, simple available, Very Good, Excellent.I want to introduce for my friend.Very Very Excellent.
5	1401321600	I keep this on my key ring all the time. Nothing sticking out the end to collect garbage like other USB sticks can have. Does what I want and cost not much.
4	1401321600	Slick design which makes it easy to carry around as part of your keychain. Carries a lot of memory for its size. It's not the fastest in terms of transfer speed, but gets the job done sufficiently.
4	1401235200	Received item as described strong durable hard drive satisfied with my purchase. Thxs..will make another purchase for friends and give out as gifts great price.
5	1401235200	Does what it is supposed to do.  Item arrived quickly and in good condition.  The ring is helpful so you don't lose it.  64gb for this price was good.
5	1401235200	This is an awesome flash drive for the price.  It is well designed and made and carries a &#34;lifetime&#34; warranty.
5	1401148800	Just received two of these for Emergency Response equipment to have on hand for file transfers. Loaded them with data and they worked well. Very compact in their metal shells are what we needed, loop helps keep up with them.
5	1401148800	These are great USB flash drives - nicely designed and they work... the way you'd expect.Two things to consider before buying:-  They are slightly smaller than you'd expect from the (enlarged) product photographs.  Not a bad thing at all, as the loop is still plenty large enough for a keyring, or for you to grasp with your fingers - but smaller than I expected.-  If you're planning to buy one, buy two.  Anyone you loan this two will &#34;forget&#34; to return it, because it's really a delight to hold in your hand.
4	1401062400	I love this flash drive. It is very handy and you can hook it on to your keychain. Only drawback is that it doesn't have a cover. If it came with some sort of attached cover I would have no problem giving 5 stars.
5	1401062400	It is smaller than I expected, which was a nice surprise, works as it is supposed to, so no complaints. Looks great on my keychain, it's actually a bit smaller than a regular key.
4	1401062400	It works, it's small, and it looks cool. I assume it is durable as well but haven't tried anything to find out.
5	1401062400	This is one of the best flash drives I have used. Sturdy, reliable, and no worries about losing the cap or breaking it. The price is very reasonable and work great on the key chain.
5	1401062400	GREAT little jump drive! Thank you for offering this item through Amazon's Prime program. It made the process as easy as pressing a button, and my item arrived in 2 days. Thanks!
5	1401062400	Seems like a great drive.  Hopefully it stays that way, and continues to work, as it is an enterprise drive, it BETTER!
4	1400976000	This is the perfect size and works just fine.  The only little problem it is has it that it does not glide smoothly into the port of any of the computers/laptops I have.  It's a rough push to get in and hard to pull out.
5	1400803200	Nice that it can go on a keyring- portable and convenient. Sleek design, easy to use. Thumbs up! Super design!
5	1400803200	i bought it another one
5	1400716800	KICK ASS!!! Tiny and useful.  Feel like a secret agent man.  So small and easy to use.  Put the info on it, and there it is.
4	1400630400	Not their fault I have an old android.  I think this drive is cool, and I'll hang onto it for when i get a new phone.
3	1400630400	i have had several flash drives, i know that when a flash drive says that it is 64Gb it is going to be a little short of that but the reason i gave this flash drive 3 stars is because it only gives you 60Gb out of the package. that is 4 whole gigabytes which seems like alot to me.
5	1400630400	Pros:1. Design is extremely sleek. It's a design awarded by red dot and does stand out among all the USB drives.2. Size is small compared to other chunky USB drives out there.3. It can be put on a key chain. Very convenient.4. There's no cap, so you don't have to feel afraid that you might loose something while using your drive.5. It's waterproofed.6. Price is extremely competitive. I remember it's the cheapest (or among the cheapest) for similar products on Amazon.7. It's made in Taiwan. As all know Taiwan is known for high tech products. Things are rarely made in Taiwan now as most factories have moved to China. Therefore, when seeing something that's manufactured in Taiwan, grab it!
5	1400630400	I would buy this again.  Seems to be well made, and has decent write speeds.  Perfect for adding to a key chain.
5	1400630400	shorter than a house key but about twice as thick, larger than the kensington but not as bulky and has a larger key loop which is awesome, even bought another one for a friend! file transferring can be slow... 1GB can take 5min
5	1400630400	The form factor is very practical.  The drive works as expected and it's very sturdy.  Can't beat the price for a 32 GB thumb-drive.
5	1400544000	It's great to have on key chain for wherever you need to give or get info.  It ooks neat, too!
5	1400544000	This Silicon Power 32GB Flash Drive was just what I needed before one of my DJ gigs. The promoters were running Serato and asked me to use it instead of bringing my Traktor gear down. So I said, sure why not!? I plugged this drive into my Mac and added all the tunes I wanted to play that night for the party. This little guy was perfect and I have no worries about suggesting it to you fine people of the Amazon. Go order one now.
5	1400544000	These are small. About the size of two thumbnails in length. They worked as expected, and can put on your keychain.
4	1400544000	The thumb drive is solidly built and certainly looks like it will put up with a lot of punishment.  The design is also well suited to having it on a keyring.  I'm not sure if this is a characteristic of all of these drives but my one is quite a tight fit on all USB sockets that I've tried it in.  This doesn't appear to be a problem and is preferable to a loose fit hence the 4 stars.
5	1400544000	This thing is a great keychain accessory. I was shocked at how small it actually was when I opened up the package. Not the fastest drive, not the most storage, but definitely the most convenient and inconspicuous.
4	1400457600	I love this drive.  It's versatile, useful, and unobtrusive.  I highly recommend these to anyone who needs to transfer data from your computer to an Android phone/tablet. I like using it with my non-rooted (sp?) Nexus 7, which doesn't come with external storage capabilities.  Using this drive is so much better than carrying an OTG cable adapter to use with a normal thumb drive.  They should make all USB flash drives OTG from now on.  The next time I buy one it will be USB 3.0, however.
4	1400457600	Arrived in good packaging and feels good in your hand, like it can withstand a lot.quick, sleek, durable, havent actually tested the waterproofness out yet but it feels optimistic.
5	1400457600	I really like this one. Bought it to substitute a bunch of 4- and 8-gb flash drives I had in the past.
5	1400371200	It is made of metal and you do have to be careful installing and uninstalling it from Your Computer because the part that You Plug into your Computer is also Metal so it could damage your USB Port if Your not careful when you remove it from Your USB Port. I think it would be great for a road warrior, student or someone whom needs to carry files from one place to another.
5	1400371200	Great price and they work perfectly! I accidentally bought two of them but I don't mind. They both work great and transferring files is fast. I like how it looks on my keychain and the shell feels very strong. It's light weight and easy to put in and pull out thanks to the hole on the flash drive.
5	1400371200	I love its compact size and amazing power. I bought the 64GB and it has space for everything that I need. Also, I can easily put it on my keys and never worry about losing it or misplacing it. I love the design and its elegant look. Thank you for a great product.
5	1400371200	Straight forward flash drive...fast, small enough to attach to my key ring. It has no software attached to it, so you can use it whatever way you want to. Before I bought this flash drive I looked at other drives that I would like to use because of their size but they came with the U3 software which I had a terrible time with in the past. This one is great, exactly what I need and I got it in a speedy manner.
5	1400371200	I use this in the front usb drive of my Kenwood car head unit and it works great and looks way kool.
5	1400371200	You can not beat the price! This so much more convenient that carrying the cable and memory device. Having this convenience with the 2 in 1 is incredible. I wish I had bought it  / seen it earlier. I use this own the Nexus 5 ~ I only had to install the following Google Play: Nexus USB OTG File Manager. After which it worked perfectly. It's solid aluminum build makes it feel extremely solid for it's size. It will get warm after a while of having it plugged it in. I plan on buying a few more for sure.
1	1400371200	I checked compatibility before purchasing, but does not work with the new Motorola Droid Ultra. So says Motorola. Silicon Power support was no help whatsoever.
5	1400284800	Exactly as advertised. Works really well on my keychain. Convenient and has lots of storage space. I highly recommend this item.
5	1400198400	Can't say enough about this flash drive. It's tiny and the only drawback is that I might end up losing it due its small size.
5	1400112000	Who knew there was something new to design for a flash drive? Since this unit slides inside your current USB outlets without any outer cover needed, it is the absolute smallest and lightest flash drive I've seen.It fits on any keyring - you don't notice it - its so small. It looks cool too; in an understated way.Works great of course as a flash drive, but the other covering or lack thereof is the new and very nice thing about this one.
5	1400112000	This device is a well built and robust design for the portability of up to 128 gig of data.  Well sized for placing on a key ring and with no moving parts or sliders to break this all metal device is the perfect pocket storage device.
2	1400112000	This flash drive works with my Samsung GS3, my Note 8 tablet and all my windows devices.  However it is so short that it is almost impossible to grip it when I go to remove it from my laptop. Also, it does get quite warm during use.
5	1400112000	It is light and looks kinda cool on my key chain.  I found that it transfers my files rather quickly versus other ones I've used.
5	1400112000	Very unique designed flash drive. Very small and compact but very durable aluminum construction. Small size fits nicely on my key ring so I always have it with me and it doesn't get misplaced or forgotten. I like it so well I am going to order another for my wife!
5	1400112000	i truly love this productlarge amount of spacevery very sturdywow just a great designand a great price
5	1400025600	First of all it's a sturdy little piece of equipment and a lot of storage. and to a very affordable price.Well packed and fast delivery.
5	1400025600	This thumb drive is awesome. It's very small, but not the pill size ones that you'll lose easily or accidentally eat. It's got a metal casing and feels very sturdy/durable.Lots of capacity and plenty fast. The price is great too.
4	1399939200	Good for the price on this drive with 16Gb capacity.  I'll likely pick up some more of them as I've compared the transfer rate with others I have and found this to be a bit better.
5	1399939200	This is quite a handy little flash drive and an amazing deal! I got double the capacity I would have with any other storage company for just about the same price. And it's the first flash drive I feel comfortable keeping on my keychain--there's no cap to lose and the metal casing doesn't even scratch from bumping against my keys all day.
5	1399939200	The loop attaches perfectly to key chain with no pulling to rip off.Transfer rate is very acceptable.I do worry about hub exposure and maybe a cap would help but then, the cap might get lost!
2	1399939200	I wasn't so happy with the fact that this product labeled 32GB capacity while I only got 30GB. Others I have no problem so far
5	1399852800	Good price, looks nice, feel great and work excelents!  I even know this usb has lifetime gurarantee and is water proof, so like said... No Complains!
5	1399852800	You won't find a better price for a flash drive this size anywhere else.  I would highly recommend this to any one that needs a flash drive with a lot of space.
5	1399852800	I have bought 3 so far for myself and have bought the 32gb drives for friends at work.  They fit nicely on a keychain.  After my friends at work saw me using one they just had to have one to.  I have never had a problem with any of the drives.
5	1399852800	I usually don't write reviews, but I found the Silicon Power 32GB Touch T03 to be excellent for the price.Its small, compact and super Fast!!!
5	1399852800	I needed a small and lightweight USB memory stick that could be added to my keychain and stay there through the busy days and hustle and bustle of work and daily life.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Rather than being attached to my key ring by a small thin and flimsy little wire clasp attached to the key, The key itself has the opening and it is perfect for just snapping on and off a small or medium sized caribiner that i put all of my groups of keys on.  This thing adds very little weight and bulk and does not dangle way down because it's effectively the length of a key due to the hole being incorporated into the body, rather than on top of it.I bought this one and another one that is similar (from different company here in Amazon - not hard to figure out as they are almost the same price per GB, and look the same except for the shape of this one is more open than the other.I like this one better, even though the other brand is pretty nice too.  Only had it a couple weeks now, so this opinion can change if it fails, but so far so good.  In that case, I'll update this review.Finally, I don't see how a company can make much of a profit selling this 8GB solidly built diskey for under $10.  Its an amazingly good deal.  So good, that I almost made an impulse purchase to buy 50-100 to imprint with my company logo.  Probably will still do this, but may limit it to 25 or so.
5	1399852800	Been using this for about 6 months now. It lives on my keychain (duh), so it sees medium duty. I have not yet soaked it to see what it can handle, so I don't know how &#34;waterproof&#34; it is. I suspect it will handle being dropped in a puddle, but don't leave it sit there and dry it out in a bag of rice ASAP. It is nice and small, you barely notice it is there.What this is most useful for: your personal, important data. This isn't for storing all your music/vids/pics on (except maybe some scans of irreplaceable pics). You can then have a few gigs left over if you happen to need to store some data wherever you are for whatever reason.Here is how you store your personal data securely:1. Get this flash drive.2. Google Truecrypt and download it.3. There are many instructions online for using Truecrypt, so I would look for those. Once you understand how to use the program, it is easy.4. You have a choice on how to use Truecrypt. Option 1 is that you install it on your home PC and that is all. Second option (that I recommend) is installing Truecrypt on your new flash drive as an application. You can then open your secure files on ANY PC that you have admin privileges on, and you DON'T have to install Truecrypt on that PC. You can STILL access your files on your home PC that has Truecrypt installed. This simply gives you more options.5. After you have installed Truecrypt, you create a &#34;ghost drive&#34;. You open this as another drive on your computer (like another hard drive) and put whatever you want in this &#34;ghost drive&#34;. One you dis-mount the drive from Truecrypt, your info is secure.For $7 and free Prime shipping, this is a no-brainer as a tier of backup for your info!
5	1399852800	I was looking for a sleek and inexpensive USB 2.0 and found this.Perfect for my needs, durable aluminium, and a clip loop to boot!
3	1399766400	Three stars cause it has no cap so it's open to dust, moisture, and other elements. The rest is good. Would have been better if it only had a cap.
5	1399766400	Looked for ages for a flash drive that I could put on my keychain that wouldn't be obliterated by my keys.  This worked out perfectly.  Looks like it belongs with my keys.  It works with my mac at home and the pc's at school which is brilliant.  It stays rigid even though I have my keys hanging from it.  Great little flash drive.
5	1399766400	This item looks good on a key ring and is easy to navigate. Quality flash drive overall. No complaints here
1	1399766400	The light on it doesnt work. There is a spot for the light but there is no light where it should be. Everything else is perfect. I would like a replacement
5	1399766400	I always am needing to transfer something or show someone a file that I want to share, and never had the hard drive or link, etc...UNTIL NOW! This thing is big enough to store multiple movies, songs, files, anything you need and it's tiny.  Mine stays on my keychain at all times.  Love it!
5	1399680000	This flash drive is great looking as a professional or personal gift, as well as it fits conveniently on a keychain and has tons of storage capacity.  My new go-to flash drive - love it!
2	1399680000	There is a sticker on the package that says iPad. I don't know what that means. I can't it to connect with my iPad. Jim
5	1399593600	This is the drive to have! It's fast, water proof, dust proof and it has a nice solid round hole to allow you to secure it to a key chain. The case is the size of a USB port, therefore allowing you to plug in multiple thumb drives without the danger of breaking the USB ports because of over sized thumb drives competing for space.
4	1399593600	Needed a USB drive I could put on my key ring so I would always have it handy. This drive is nice and seems solid. It is metal, NOT plastic, and has held up well so far.
5	1399593600	lots of storage in a tiny, good loking drive. I haven't had problems with dust build up so the drive being recessed but still exposed does not trouble me. I keep it on my keyring, which I recommend, because it is TEENY and easy to lose. After losing countless pendrive caps and having a hard time with being picky about the style and color of my pendrives, I landed on this one because it has the space i need without taking up space or being an eyesore
5	1399593600	I've been looking for a USB drive that I could easily slip onto my key ring and carry around with me.  All without the worry of it getting beaten up, looking stupid, etc.  This product is perfect.  It seems to be made from a single piece of aluminum.  It is very small, and fits perfectly onto a key ring, and looks cool.  Very nice product.
1	1399593600	Not happyWRONG sizeWould not orderThey should give you what you pay for and it SAYS  64GBWas nice looking  that is it
5	1399420800	I purchased 5 of these to use around the office.  Works well and has a very sleek design.  I love it.
5	1399420800	Durable and solid USB storage. It fits very firmly, with less wiggle room than a conventional design.  Small enough to easily carry on a key chain.
5	1399420800	I wanted an extra place to put certain programs on and this fits the bill. I wanted it as an extra start up for my computer but I couldn't figure out how to do this yet. I'll just used it to save some items I want easy access to.
3	1399420800	The Silicon Power Firma 64GB flash drive looks and feels great. Read speed is decent at about 30MB/s. Write speed is very low at around 5MB/s. The ZN F80 then makes a great read only/mostly storage device. If your application involves speed-sensitive writes, I suggest you look elsewhere.
5	1399334400	Loads of memory at a very good price.  I've used this memory stick for daily file updates for a few months now.  Never once had an issue or problem.  I would recommend it to a friend.  Great product at a low price with timelyh delivery.
5	1399334400	Flash drive looks attractive and small. Has a nice finish to the aluminum. Would definitely buy again. Can't believe I have 64gb on this. It's incredible how fast technology moves. This is replacing my 2gb flash drive I bought for school ages ago. I cant store so many things. The only limitation I see is the formatting. It's formatted fat32 so I can use on both major operating systems but I can't copy large files. Everything else is great though. Hope it lasts, so far i've had it two weeks on my keys and it still looks great.
5	1399334400	Tried the Kingston with a metal case but after three discussions with their techs we could not get it to work. The SP32 worked right out of the box with no problems and good speed for USB2.
5	1399334400	Simple, basic, rugged, and it does what it's supposed to. Great for taking music with you to plug into car stereos with USB inputs.
5	1399334400	I prefer a flash drive that is durable and I can connect securely to a key chain.  This unit has a smart design with an incorporated key ring.  Most that I have purchased in the past have a separate key rings that break.  Haven't used the unit much but so far *****
5	1399334400	I got my first silicon power usb as a present. I was so impressed with the build that I bought another one. They seem indestructible. Doesn't take up much space on a keychain. Fast not lightning fast but fast enough. I will probably be buying another one of these as a present.
4	1399248000	I choose this because needed it for backups.  I have an 8 gig and it been a great flash drive though I would upgrade to a 16.  I also purchased another 16 gig which totaled to 32 g.  will be using them for quickbook backup
5	1399248000	I was looking for a fairly high capacity flash drive that is small and sturdy enough to clip onto my key ring and carry in my pocket. I wondered if this might not become filled with lint and dirt, but that hasn't been a problem. The metal shell is tough and durable and the drive works perfectly every time. I back up the contents to my computer hard drive periodically just to be safe, but don't anticipate any problems with this flash drive based on several weeks of daily use.
5	1399248000	I bought this drive to use as storage for my Wii U, works awesome, incredibly solid construction, bought a 32gb just to attach to my key ring. Dont really need the second one, but the all aluminum is cool and makes me feel like a secret agent.
5	1399248000	These are extremely well made and tough . I keep one on my key chain and it's so handy and not bulky
5	1399161600	This drive is compact. I was stunned at how small it actually is. It had adequate read/write speeds, and I have had no issues with it not being recognized on either of my computers. I made a DVD rip to see how the drive would handle a large (1+GB) file size, because that was something that would make older drives grind to a halt. It plays flawlessly on my TV. I couldn't be happier.
5	1399161600	I am definitely pleased with this product. I have never heard of the Silicon Power brand until now, but this flash drive was on sale for a pretty good price for a 64GB, so I couldn't resist.Pros: It's so easy to carry it around! I hooked it up to my keychain and it's perfect for portability when going to school, or your job, or to wherever you would need it. Data transfer is fairly quick, and it's very easy to plug in and take out.Cons: I honestly have not found one yet, I'm really liking it!Anyone who uses a computer could benefit from this product, especially from the fact that it holds 64 gigs. I highly recommend it!
5	1399161600	It's hard to believe that something so little can store so much information!  A great product. Get it now, today!
5	1399161600	This is superduper good.  I like it and have being using it for three months so far with no issues with it.  BBBUUUTTT, I received the item late and before that complained that I did not get it,  So amazon refunded me.  After three days, I received it.  Thus, I think hat I got it for free.  I hope I know hot to make sure and hope that the seller contact me asap.
4	1399075200	Very Handy, I use it for work to keep from fililng up my computer.  It holds a lot of information
5	1399075200	Bought as gifts for High school kids. They love them, no caps to loose, and they attached them to their lanyards.
5	1399075200	TLDR:This flash drive looks great and feels great. The USB 2.0 performance is excellent - this is a fast drive! The integrated keychain loop is perfect and makes inserting and removing this solidly constructed drive a breeze. It is small and slim enough to fit in tight quarters with other USB peripherals. It has a professional, classy appearance that all your friends will envy - highly recommended!!Full Review:I buy the 16GB, aluminum-finish, integrated-keyring version of these things like popcorn.I have purchased more than 2 dozen and never seen a bad one. My first purchase was about a year ago. I work in IT and need to carry 2-3 flash drives for myself (I hang them on myEnergizer LED Keychain Light- also bought on Amazon). However, I also buy them for my clients and use them as install disks for OS installs (using the Windows 7 USB/DVD tool, which also works with Windows 8 and 8.1), among other things. CrystalDisk benchmarks Read at 16.27 MB/s Avg and Write at 5.89 MB/s Avg (Sequential read/write of 1024K blocks, 5 passes @ 1GB/pass). This is surprisingly consistent with actual speeds observed during day-to-day operations using mixed file types/sizes.The USB interface is protected by the metal body/housing, but not capped. I strongly prefer this design to both capped and retractable/sliding drive interfaces.I believe many retractable and capped types are more fragile in day-to-day usage. Inevitably, the other types break down around the USB interface, either because they get subtly bent/stressed where the USB interface joins the body (every time even a little bit of pressure is applied to the body) and eventually deteriorate, or because the USB interface housing itself disintegrates after being plugged/unplugged enough times. Additionally, I have had occasional problems working with those other drive types, either in tight spaces because the body is fatter (retractable drives in particular), or when the drive cap gets lost and the entire USB interface is now permanently exposed and quickly becomes damaged. Some people may be concerned about dirt or contaminants making it up into the USB interface of this drive because there is no cap. However, this has not yet been a problem, and I anticipate no issues until I decide to stick it face first in the mud.I also found this drive to be superior to the smaller, but similar Kingston drive. The larger loop is worth it!I was recently at a computer shop and a friend was using his go-to flash drive to do something. Sadly, it was having problems (I was unaware before this that some computers cannot read some file types off certain flash drives given identical formatting). We plugged in my drive and voila! - no problems! He has since switched :)Addressing concerns:As stated by others, the drive is not curved. I believe this is an illusion in the photo created by the tapering from the body to the ring, which actually improves the feel. Unlike other reviewers, I have never detected any heat issues - even after extended read/write activity over many GB of data and an hour of intense usage it is barely warm. My guess is the heat issue is a result of the device the product is being used in more than an issue with the drive itself, and the reviewers are just not feeling the heat buildup in other products because they are using a plastic drive that insulates them from the heat. I have used exactly one on a MAC with no problems. Also, these drives fit precisely, with no unwanted play, in every port I have tested them in. I have never had any corruption or similar issues with files. Every now and then, devices come off the assembly line with flaws (has happened to me with other products). If you got a bad one, I would encourage you to take advantage of Amazon's return policy and try one more time.Please note: A single thumb drive with all your important documents on it is not a safe backup solution. Even though I have never had a problem with this product, I know that all drives will eventually fail. Personally, I keep three backups, one of which is off-site. I lost all my data once - that was enough for a lifetime!
3	1399075200	I have 2 of those flash drives - one in 8GB, another in 16GB. They have very nice shape, convenient for key chain, and seem to be somehow resistant to scratches.One bad thing - fairly low performance. Either FAT32 or NTFS brought me about 4-5MB/s write speed and about 15MB/s read speed.That is nothing to be proud of. Write speed is 3 times lower that 15MB/s that some reviewers mentioned here. Either they mistakenly tested a wrong (faster) drive, or manufacturer changed product over time to lower their cost.In the same order I also got SP Blaze B30  for just a couple dollars more, and that one rocks - 24MB/s NTFS write speed on legacy USB 2.0 port. Not as sleek, not waterproof, but FAST. Do yourself a favour, get that instead. Filling 16GB (or God forbid, 32 or 64) at 5MB/s is a recipe for frustration.
5	1398988800	Got this one for my wife, mine holds less. I would buy another and I currently recommed them to anyone needing a flash drive. So far 7 or 8 of my friends have them and use them daily. Mine spent a week out in the snow/ice, 6 inches deep, where I dropped it getting in or out of my car. Still works and I am still using it today.
4	1398988800	I love having 64GB on my keychain. I just wish there was a USB 3 version to be a bit faster.
5	1398988800	I have too many flash drives but none that are not plastic. I had a few break on my key ring so I searched for a metal one. This ended my search. The 64Gb unit was great until Windows 7 kept asking to &#34;scan and fix&#34; it. I always checked no until the other day when I accidentally was looking at my second monitor and hit enter which caused the thing to scan. It ruined my drive so that it can no longer been seen on any computer. After a day of trying to access it, I just bought another one.If anyone knows how to get my drive back, please fill me in. I did turn off the nag screen (too late) by stopping the shell hardware detection. The drive was awesome until &#34;scan and fix&#34; killed it. The second one is working great.
4	1398988800	great stick, all metal. the only thing that bothers me is the size. it's very very small!!!!i am very careful not to lose it!
5	1398902400	Yeah that sounds a little creepy. But it is. Some things are so simply and beautifully designed, that you cant help but to admire them.And I do. Ive even gotten compliments on it...
3	1398902400	I purchased this item in the &#34;gray aluminum&#34; color, which is a different design than the other colors listed. This review is ONLY for the gray aluminum version.Because of the odd shape of the device, it wouldn't really fit into my USB port. Fortunately, I won't be using this as a data device because taking it in/out of the port would probably wreck the inside of my computer. I had to push it in and wiggle it around to get it to connect to the computer. Since I'm only using this for a system restore disk, that isn't a huge issue. If I had bought this for any other purpose, I would have returned it.
5	1398902400	this is an amazing product. this product is very pretty and i can put with key chain so that i wont lose it anymore.
5	1398902400	Great product!! This is exceeds my expectations. Lightweight and hangs beautifully from a small command hook on the backside of my computer.
5	1398902400	I needed a larger capacity flash drive and also wanted a flash drive that had a low profile without being too small to grasp. I am using this in my 3D printer for autonomous printing. My older flash drive stuck out so much that I was constantly bumping into it and was afraid of damaging it and the printer. This fits perfectly. It's fast and I have not noticed ANY heat buildup due to its aluminum body shell as some have said. It has stayed cool to the touch. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
5	1398816000	Sure it's a little bit more expensive than other memory sticks, but it is a lot smaller so it doesn't take up as much space on your keychain.  It also looks great and it built tough.
5	1398816000	Neat little gizmo. Works great. Anyone with an older cell phone should get this to easily transfer their pictures to the computer.
5	1398816000	It's replaced an SD card reader and other cables for me. At a fair price, too. What's not to like?!
5	1398729600	One would not think that the question of choosing one portable memory rather than another would arise.After all, I never cared what (quality) brand of CD I was burning!  But in fact, flash drives affect one (or is it just me?) differently. This little drive is nice to look at, nice to touch (chunky, yet not heavy metal), and is easy to put on a key ring. So I like it and prefer it to another. Simple as that.
5	1398643200	Simply put, this things great.Fits on my carabiner, durable, and fits a little under 16 gb (like all hard drives)Just wish the price was a little cheaper, but the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
4	1398643200	It was not exactly as I expected, but I think I might have misread the copy. Make sure this is what you want and, if so, the price is right.
5	1398643200	I have forgotten a few USB drives, especially since nowadays USB drives are getting smaller and smaller. Finally I found this one, and thought, I shouldn't forget it if it's on my keychain!It works exactly as I imagined. The metal case is sturdy. It is a bit tighter than most USB port, because it has a protective valve inside of the port to protect the contacts--this is necessary for this no-cap design. I don't find any problem plug it in computers. Now basically I'm taking it everywhere I go ;)
5	1398643200	Great buy. It gets a little warm during some heavy use but cools quickly. I would definitely recommend this product.
5	1398643200	Fantastic does exactly what I want it to do. If you need to free up some phone memory on the go then this is the product for you.
3	1398643200	well I guess I forgot my nook hd doesn't use the otg drive I have.  So that part isn't useable but the other part is working just fine.dave
5	1398643200	I keep my portable storage in my pocket knife pants pocket and this is the smallest flash drive yet. The fact that it sports two connections is really useful too. It goes where I go and fits more devices. Sixteen GB is usually large enough for most of what I do. My only suggestion would be to provide a cap for the USB side (larger connection) to prevent my pocket lint from occupying the space ;-o
2	1398556800	Doesn't work with all devices, requires extra configuration, requires more effort than it is worth. It is usable as a standard flash drive when reformatted for your OS but pricey and slow for that purpose.
4	1398556800	This device exceeded my expectations .It has proved to very reliable and .The aluminum construction is deal for a keychain
5	1398556800	This is a very useful product. .. one of a kind object that makes it possible to have a computer in your pocket
5	1398556800	All that storage space on a device the size of a typical key. I bought it for my granddaughter for backup of her important college documents (in addition to her cloud storage - more than one backup source is prudent). So was pleased at the size and capacity.
5	1398556800	This is my favorite capless USB drive. The material has a high quality solid feel to it. It does not feel cheap at all. This will be the only USB drive I will use from now on. I am really glad I found this one. It is a great product at a great price.
5	1398556800	Fant&aacute;stico producto!! I am greatly pleased with this product & I will definitely be buying more items from Silicon Power. &#128522;
5	1398470400	Unobtrusive, efficient, top quality and really beautiful design. Several people have asked me about my cool &#34;key chain&#34; and then admired it. This looks even better in person.
5	1398470400	The X10 is a very useful device for carrying a lot of files that don't have to be immediately accessible in your Android phone. It's USB 2.0 so large files (i.e. movies) take a while to transfer, but that's a simple plan-ahead issue anyway. The obvious beauty of the X10 is its ability to plug directly into your desktop/laptop as well as your Android phone, without the hassle of wires.
4	1398384000	Seems entirely functional, no problems that I've noticed. The one downside is the risk of leaving your keys behind in your computer.
4	1398384000	So this FM has a great design, is aluminum so nothing beats that. When you plug it in you have to make sure that you plug it right, because otherwise the write speeds will be really low. I have found that if you plug it just till the number where it shows the capacity of the drive it works wonders. I'm using this to boot Win 8 in laptops and is working just fine. I definitely recommend it.4 stars! 1 star less for the hassle of making sure that the drive is connected properly, you'll see what I mean once you buy it.
5	1398384000	Great product, nice design, easy to carry, looks great, good value in general.It sometimes gets hot after long transferring large files.
5	1398384000	The drive is great. It fits on a key ring and is actually smaller than most of my keys. Works great and transfers data fast.
5	1398384000	I bought two 16gb F80s, one to use on my mac and another for a chromebook. The first thing you notice is that the drive is tiny. Like, super tiny. It basically disappears into the port except for the ring. It fits easily on a keychain, looks good, and holds information. What more could you want?
1	1398297600	If you need to store a lot of data, but only MOVE small amounts of data this thing would be awesome for the price/form.  However, if you are moving large amounts of data or streaming media from this device beware.  Look elsewhere for your needs.  Set it up to move a few gigs of data when I first got it, went to pull it out and it was extremely hot to the touch, almost hot enough to burn you.  Try streaming media?  Good luck.  The data transfer rates required for that will have this thing burning up in a matter of minutes.  I use thumb drives in my cars navi system and this thing can't get through a song without overheating to the point that it disconnects itself and needs to cool down before it will  even mount again.Avoid this one.
5	1398297600	I bought this jump drive for my job, we needed some and I liked the look of this so I got it. What I was surprised by is how efficient it is. It is easy to carry, (put it on a keychain)easy  to connect and holds a surprising amount of data. I liked it so much I got some for personal use.
5	1398297600	It works great!  It's not USB 3.0, but it's fine because my macbook pro doesn't have a USB 3.0 port.  Overall, it's fast enough for my needs.
5	1398297600	Just what I was looking for. It's fast (for USB 2.0), light, and fairly sturdy (not indestructable).After 9 months of use, it has a little bend on the key end, but it's not too bad.It is SO NICE to always have access to storage media, since it is on my keychain and always with me.This is the one. just get it!
5	1398297600	As represented, promptly shipped.. Much easier to carry and use than most yet still adequate for most uses. Constantly with you on your key ring.
4	1398297600	This is a cute little drive--a bit hard to get in and out--but not a really big drawback.  Let's see how it fares over time.  The price was certainly right!
5	1398211200	Works great and fast. I love the small thin design. Keeps on a key ring nice. Does fit tight in computers. Made me a little scared at first when putting it in the first time. But have had no problems with it. I run large files and lots of movies on it and have no issues. Will buy another soon.
5	1398211200	I love the look of these flash drives.  Solid build, I never worry about it breaking being attached to my keychain.Would recommend to others.
5	1398124800	works flawless and performs with no problem and does exactly what is supposed to do O!O(cool)  to cool cool
5	1398124800	This is one of the smallest flash drives you're going to see. 32 GB and smaller than your pinky. Works great!
5	1398124800	It has a sleek and solid design.  Very durable.  Great for use on a keychain.  Good read/write rates.11/10 Would recommend.
5	1398124800	This flash drive works really well for my personal needs.  I enjoy being able to attach this storage unit to my key chain so that I always have it available.  Due to it's metal design, I don't have to worry about it braking in my pocket.
5	1398124800	Pros: solid build, great look, large loop for easy keychain attachmentCons: speeds not very fast even for USB 2 standards.
5	1398038400	Its a USB 2.0, it works flawlessly.  I do wish speed was bit faster but its good as any regular USB 2.0.  Good size and convenient.  I would buy again for size, value, and quality.
1	1398038400	I bought this USB flash drive 6 months ago. Having used it only a few days here and there to &#34;sneaker-net&#34; items between Mac and PC it is no longer working. I am very careful with it from keeping it in a dry, cool place to properly ejecting it, but this is just cheap merchandise. It's possible it lacks a capped end and that may what's wrong with it, but no basic trouble shooting, i.e. cleaning it carefully with a can of air, has remedied the situation. I am strongly disappointed.
5	1398038400	Hi y'all i have to say this USB is great, very sturdy and feels very strong i keep it on my key chain since im in school a lot and write a lot of papers so transfer files a lot! deff worth the price at only $18!!
5	1398038400	This is nice, sharp looking and hold lots of data.  I purchased for Little League to keep all the records on them so When I am through at the end of the year I can hand off to new board members
5	1398038400	I was shopping around for an inexpensive jump drive to store some files that I carry with me daily. I love the unique design I can carry it with me on my key chain.
4	1398038400	I like the small profile and capacity very much and it has so far performed perfectly without conflicts with any machines I hook it to.  The only concern I have is with the flimsy chain that comes with it.  I do not trust it at all.  I know it is very maneuverable in it's place in my pocket but I don't trust that &#34;necklace chain.&#34;
5	1398038400	The flash drive works fine and has a lot of space compared to other flash drives at a similar price.
5	1397952000	16Gb is plenty of room to hold music, books in pdf, etc.  Light and can attach to your Key Ring.
5	1397952000	This product is exactly what I needed for my BlackBerry Z30. There's millions of BB10 customers that could use some of these!
5	1397952000	Very convenient size, made from strong material and easily fits on my key chain. Offers more memory at a price that is very hard to beat!
5	1397865600	Boots fast to me and has plenty of room. It also matches my troika key ring with a nice aluminum finish. I am a little wary about the exposed end but so far no problems with dirt and they claim that water is not a problem either. I have gotten it wet multiple times and it still works fine.
5	1397865600	I chose this flash drive simply because it was less expensive and had the memory I was looking for, The item was received early and in perfect condition. The flash drive worked as advertised without any problems
5	1397779200	Android devices have been very popular in the last decade, but manufacturers always price gouge their customers when it comes to storage. Sometimes the price difference between a 16GB and 32GB model can cost as much as $50 more, and even then, 32GB is insufficient to those who use their device daily. Thankfully, Silicon Power has made the Silicon Power Mobile X10 32GB USB 2.0 OTG Flash Drive as an extension of storage for micro USB compatible android devices.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; Silicon Power Mobile X10 Flash Drive&#9654; AccessoriesThe only included accessory is a cap that is attached to the micro USB. This cap will provide three uses:1. Protects the micro USB from damage and dust2. Allows the user to attach it to their keychain and avoid the drive from being lost.3. Allows the user to remove the drive from the inserted USB port.This note will be made again in the hardware section, but this USB drive is very small. The drive is so small that you can&#8217;t remove it unless you grab on the micro USB end, which is very difficult. The cap is essential to avoid the micro USB from being damaged when removing the drive from your computer.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Dimension: 30.7 x 12.05 x 4.55 mm&#8226; Weight: 3.5g&#8226; Capacity: 8/16/32 GB&#8226; Color: Champagne Silver&#8226; Interface: USB 2.0 high-speed (Charging is not supported)&#8226; Material: Metal&#8226; Supported OS Operation Systems:- PC : Windows 8 / 7 / Vista / XP / 2000 , Mac OS 10.3.x, Linux 2.6.x- Mobile device : Android 4.1.+*(*Supports OTG function of mobile devices)&#8226; Warranty: Lifetime warranty&#9654; HardwareFor the design of a USB and Micro USB combo on a flash drive, this is the smallest possible size it possibly can (1.2 x 0.47 x 0.17 inches). The drive is so small, as noted in the accessory section, that you can place the USB into your computer and only see the tip of the micro USB out. This space is so small, that you are required to use the included cap, to safely remove the USB from the USB port. The body of this is made of a golden colored zinc alloy, made to be waterproof. This drive will supposedly last forever, as SP has given this product a lifetime warranty. This should assure you that this product was made to last. The top of the drive has the micro USB interface, the bottom has the USB interface, the front has the SP logo, and the back has the certifications from the CE and FCC. I overall really like the simplistic but durable construction of the drive, and the fact that it is an attachment through the micro USB interface. Silicon Power made an all-in-one device, without the need for wires. My only wish would be for this drive to be USB 3.0, as it is a much faster speed than USB 2.0, but this may have been a limitation of the micro USB port.&#9654; CompatibilityDue to hardware and software limitations of many Android devices -- especially older ones, I can ONLY guarantee compatibility with the following devices:&#8226; Samsung: Galaxy S5, S4, S3, S2, S4 Active, Note, Note 2, Note 3, Mega; Galaxy Express, Galaxy Tab 3 8.0/10.1, Galaxy Note 8.0.&#8226; HTC: One 2013 (M7), One Max, One Mini, Desire 7060, First, One X+, Evo 4G LTE, DROID DNA.&#8226; Motorola [*]: Moto G, Moto X, Droid Mini, Droid Ultra, Droid Maxx, RAZR M, RAZR HD, RAZR MAXX HD, Xyboard 8.2&#34; Tablet.&#8226; Google: Nexus 5, Nexus 7 (2012 Original & 2013 New), Nexus 10, Galaxy Nexus; third-party software required or device being rooted.&#8226; Sony: Xperia Z2 Tablet 10.1, Z1, Z1 Compact, Z, Z Ultra, Tablet Z; Xperia S39h.&#8226; LG: LG G2, Optimus G Pro; Asus: MeMO ME171, MeMO Pad FHD 10; Dell Venu 8; Lenovo K900&#8226; Xiaomi: RedMi, 3, 2S, 2A, 2, 1S, Xiaomi Box; Huawei: X1, B199, Ascend P6, Ascend, D2, Mate; Oppo: Find 7, N1; Meizu: MX, MX2, MX3.Notable devices that are NOT compatible and may require additional hardware/or software: Google Nexus 4, HTC M8 (One 2014).The on-the-go compatibility is only compatible with manufacturers that choose to allow it. Some devices, such as the Nexus 4 and HTC M8 require a powered OTG cable, which doesn&#8217;t make the Mobile X10 incompatible, but instead redundant, as you would be using the USB instead of micro USB. Some devices have semi support, such as my Nexus 7, which require additional software and the device to be rooted (a term used to unlock full privileges), while others like the Samsung Galaxy require no additional software or hardware.&#9654; SetupSetup is not necessary for this device, as any USB port (USB 1.1/2.0/3.0) and operating system (Windows, Mac, and Linux) should automatically detect and use the device.&#9654; TestingI first plugged the USB port into my computer. The drive shows up as &#8220;Removable Disk&#8221; with 29.4GB of useable storage in the FAT32 format. I then benchmarked the drive, using a software called &#8220;CrystalDiskMark&#8221;, a software used to determine the read and write of the drive. For proof, see customer image.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 x64 (C) 2007-2013Silicon Power Mobile X10 32GB USB 2.0 OTG-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read:  30.595 MB/sSequential Write:  11.302 MB/sRandom Read 512KB:  30.438 MB/sRandom Write 512KB:  0.328 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1):  7.879 MB/s [  1923.6 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1):  0.003 MB/s [  0.6 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32):  8.397 MB/s [  2050.0 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32):  0.003 MB/s [  0.7 IOPS]Test: 1000 MB [H: 0.0% (0.0/29.4 GB)] (x5)Date: 2014/04/17 14:03:15OS: Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 [6.1 Build 7601] (x64)-----------------------------------------------------------------------These tests concluded that the drive was able to Write at 11.3 MB/s and Read at 30.5 MB/s; these results are above average for a USB 2.0 device, which average around 9 MB/s Write and 20 MB/s Read. I am satisfied by the benchmark tests, however, during the benchmark tests, the USB drive became very warm, which may be a future issue.  If anyone were curious, I was able to produce similar results (11.4 MB/s Write; 29.80 MB/s Read) using a micro USB to USB adapter. We can safely assume this USB is able to transfer data on both ends at equal speeds.I then tested the fit and use of the micro USB into my Nexus 7 (2013). The micro USB fit into my Nexus 7, but it wasn&#8217;t a tight fit by any means. There are no fasteners on the top of the micro USB to maintain a tight fit, which is unfortunate, as this was probably made to cut costs on the device. I then attempted to move an 804MB movie from the OTG drive to my Movies directory, and resulted to transfer at a rate of 12-18 MB/s, which is higher than the benchmarked results. I was overall satisfied with the performance of this OTG drive.&#9654; Final ThoughtsAlthough there is room for improvement, this device is definitely very functional; allowing it to physically transfer files from my computer to tablet without the need of excessive wires. The concept alone is genius, as there are similar devices, but not one that bridges a USB with a micro USB. I would recommend this to anyone with a compatible device and give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ A well made device, designed to connect to your mobile phone and PC without needing additional adapters or cables.+ Benchmarked very fast (11.3 MB/s Write, 30 MB/s Read) for a USB 2.0 device. Similar results received for both USB and micro USB ports.+ Lifetime warranty should ensure you that this device will be long lasting.Cons:- Not compatible with all Android devices, due to hardware and software limitations. This is not the fault of this device though.- Micro USB port doesn&#8217;t have fasteners to grip inside the micro USB port of mobile devices, which leads to a loose fit.- Micro USB port may overheat in USB port with extended periods of time.- Isn&#8217;t USB 3.0, a newer and faster USB standard. This may be a limitation of the hardware though.- Require cap at end to remove drive from PC.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.
5	1397779200	Great Design, and very light USB Flash drive... Design and quality of this flash drive is way off its competitors and traditional flash drives available in the market.Definitely recommend !!
5	1397779200	I'm no expert in tech stuff, but it works great for me. I just filled it up with music, and popped it in my car system and it works fine.
4	1397692800	I love the look and feel of this drive. The aluminum case feels solid. The one and only negative (?) concern- it is a very tight fit when plugging into a USB port. This may turn out to be a good thing...it may last longer since it is very secure in the socket. But it is a little alarming when you first plug it in due to the very tight fit.
5	1397692800	It has a very nice, sturdy feeling in your hand. The only thing even possibly wrong is that it is a bit tight in the computer, but it isn't too bad. It looks cool and has plenty of space, so that is all that matters.
5	1397692800	This USB drive works as to be expected. I use it on my iMac and i had no problems with it reading it. The read and write speeds are quick enough for movies as this is the primary use for me. I chose this drive based on other reviews and the look of the drive. It is quite flashy (pun intended). Also, it claims to be impervious to the elements but i have not tested this out yet. I ride a bike a lot and carry it in my backpack so its only a matter of time before it gets wet. I'll update when that happens. All in all its a good USB drive. you can't go wrong buying it.
5	1397692800	This is definitely a solid device and equally attractive. It worked perfectly out of the box!  Delivered the item quickly as well - all in all, I'm very satisfied!
5	1397606400	Tiny and Works great on a key chain. Get one, it is super nice to always have a way to store digital info on your keys. This is super durable and perfect for that application.
5	1397606400	All as I wanted, Silicon Power 64GB Firma ZN F80 USB 2.0 Flash Drive, Gray Aluminium...good quality and perfect design
2	1397606400	I got this flash drive for the sole purpose of using it for a mobile browser with LastPass, the performance is completely abysmal and nearly unusable, read/write speeds are nearly nonexistent, MAYBE 1MB/s at its best.Solid design and sturdy, but what does that matter when it fails miserably at its sole purpose.
5	1397606400	Great for keychains. Light & sturdy and very efficient. I always wanted one of these. Will definitely buy again if I had to. Hopefully it won't be soon. :)
5	1397606400	Shipped promptly and with no problems. Great price and value too! Highly recommend as an alternative to an external HDD. If you keep most stuff in the cloud this should so the trick.
5	1397606400	Innovative design and great price.  Connected it to some of my tablets for extra storage - works great.  I will buy a couple more in the near future.
4	1397520000	I do really like this drive.  It is small, but with the loop, easy to keep track of. My one complaint is that it is a bit too tight in many computers, and because of that the outer coating is beginning to scratch and chip off on the female connection end.
5	1397520000	low profile and able to plug into my smart phone  or android tablet  take that Apple products!  I may buy another...
5	1397520000	When I opened the package the USB liked way to small to fit in any USB port but it does. It works with Xbox,laptops, and anything else that can use flash drives. It came with a little chain that can attach to you key chains and stuff.
1	1397520000	Didn't received the productThe packet was very poorly packed it, it was almost open pallet. Fortunately I have received the Key chain and Car USB adapter. Please don&#8217;t send the products like this. I never had a such experience with Amazon before.
5	1397520000	This jump drive is very small and compact. Seems to be sturdy. Hopefully I'll be able to use this for a long time!
5	1397520000	I've had the 32GB version for several months, and I love it!  I got it because I was tired of breaking the ring off of plastic thumb drives.  This one is solid is a rock, with nothing to go wrong.  When the 64GB came on sale, I grabbed it.  Highly recommended!
3	1397433600	This is a flash drive that fits nicely on a key chain.Its slow for a USB 2.0 disk drive.
5	1397433600	great portable jump drive. It's a lot smaller than I was expecting, but that's okay cause it fits well on my key chain. About a quarter inch shorter than a standard house key.
3	1397433600	I bought this on promotion deal, I love it when I can transfer files between my PC and Nexus 5 phone but I do notice the USB drive do get hot really fast when its plug into micro usb on my phone and usb hub on my PC. Transfer rate is so so.
4	1397433600	Perfect size for keychain and convenient. Sturdy and surprisingly small. Great to have important documents on the go or to use as two step authentication for your passwords.
5	1397347200	It does exactly as advertised.  Very handy.  I wear it on a chain around my neck.  Would recommend to friends
5	1397347200	What I like the most about this flash drive is that is a durable metal item.  I have had so many plastic ones that break,
5	1397347200	this is very sturdy and compact. this will last years as its banged up in my pocket. very good construction and nice 32gb capacity space
4	1397260800	This thumb drive was what I was looking for. I needed to have the ability carry files with me anywhere. the compact size and aluminum hosing make it ideal to carry with my keys.It fits a bit snug into the the USB drive, but still manage to eject it with no problems.I did notice that it did get a bit warm when I am transferring files.So far it is holding up well being attached to my keys.
4	1397260800	ProsThe price cannot be beat even compared to non micro-usb drivesHas a cap for the Micro-USB sideWorks as intendedVery smallConsNo cap for the Bigger USB sideDust could eventually cause problemsThis (micro-) USB drive is a lot smaller than I expected!  This is a great addition to my Moto X which does not have a port for sd cards, but does work with this flash drive. I also use this to play music on my car stereo which provides a good place to store this because the regular USB connection does not have a cover (the whole drive is the USB connector).  This is my only issue with this drive although I knew it was this way when I bought it.
2	1397260800	Has a slower read than my old 32gb 4 year old thumb drive, this one only reads at about 19MB/s, old one read at 30ish.Write is faster on this one though at about 12 vs 9 on my old one.Does have a nice metal case, that feels like it is going to break any USB I plug it into.
1	1397260800	I had never heard of this company/brand before, but I thought how bad can it be? Digital storage is digital storage--it should be fairly simple and straight forward. So I purchased 2 for my sons to use for high school. Almost immediately came the same complaints from both of them. Certain files added would cause all the files on the drive to corrupt and be unreadable. These same files that caused the corruption stored just fine on other flash drives that they owned. To fix the problem, my sons would have to reformat the drive and scan for errors, which would cause it to hang,  causing further aggravation. After repeating this scenario over and over again my sons finally gave up because it just wasn't worth the hassle. So do yourself a favor and purchase from a reputable company. I will avoid anything listed by Silcon Power in the future.
5	1397260800	It's exact what I wanted for my keychain. 64 gigs of pocket memory that goes everywhere I do. The open slot can accumulate pocket lint, but who wouldn't expect that? I quick blow or a light toothpick dig clears it right out. It hold up quite well to scratching being next to my keys all day. Do get me, it scratched, it just does brilliantly well for the circumstances. It's very light, and I can't even feel it in my hand when I'm holding it.It's not super fast, but I didn't pay for speed. I got about 15 Mb/sec writes and I was able to move roughly 50 Gigs of video from my computer to the drive in an hour.
5	1397174400	A very trim, sleek flash drive with lots of storage. I have one for work and one for personal use. Yes, it fits tightly into the USB slot, but it works and that is all I need.
5	1397174400	I was tired of those little flash drives with the cords popping off my keys and I'd lose everything. This isn't going anywhere. And 32GB for that price was awesome too. Really happy with it.
5	1397174400	I have had other usb products before but this one is the best so far.  no moving parts that will eventually break.  the size is just perfect and it works perfectly.  have recommended the same to friends.  thanks for a great product.
5	1397174400	This flash drive is well made (hard aluminum) and easy to fit on your key chain. Planning to buy a couple more, soon
5	1397174400	At this point in time I'm not sure what can be said about USB drives.  Order the 32GB, it's fast, solid, exactly what was needed for portable storage attached to my keys.
5	1397174400	Nothing unusual about this key.  Does what it's supposed to without any problems so far.  Great price for the storage space, has a good solid feel to it.
5	1397174400	Decent transfer with a nice big ring to hold on to. Big space for about 50 cents a gigabyte. I have lots of flash drives and this is as good as other top names. Very slim with a good build.
1	1397174400	&#8230;but for some reason when I try to move files from it to my computer or other flash drives this flash drives fails.  I don't know the technical term, but my computer sends out a message saying that I improperly unplugged or removed it.  Then I have to try to move the file again and again and again&#8230;.  Sometimes they get moved and sometimes they don't.  Maybe I damaged the flash drive somehow so I cannot say for sure what the cause of the problem is.
5	1397088000	I bought two! Large storage for a small package.  So small I didn't realize the second usb plug is the unit itself.  Of course as pictured you pull it apart to access the micro usb as pictured.
3	1397088000	First, this works as a usb drive in my pc and with Nexus OTG app on my Nexus 7 as advertisied.I don't usually criticize things for being to small, but when plugged in the pc usb ports, so little sticks out that it is hard to remove, I thought I was going to have to get pliers to retrieve it. Also you cannot grasp it by the cap because the cap comes off to easily.Speaking of the cap, I was hoping to add this to a keyring, but the cap is so loose I would lose the drive the first time i carried it.Not a bad enough device to send back, but bad enough I'll try another brand next time.
5	1397088000	Thank you for this product, as me describio and of great help for my labors daily. RegardsI wait to continue possessing this type of products.
2	1397088000	You could not go wrong on the price on this. I see losing the drive since there is no way to put it on a key ring. A good idea that still needs a little work.
5	1397088000	I like this flash drive, it was relatively inexpensive and has worked on all of the computers I have tried at my university.
5	1397001600	this is the best flash drive have I had.  It is easy to use.  it gives you confidence when you handle it.
5	1397001600	It looks great. It is very compact. It has a great attachment loop for your keychain. No problems with usage!
5	1396915200	I am impressed at the ease of use and small size of this flash drive. Using this is much easier than being tethered.
5	1396915200	it was smaller than i thought, but its perfect for what i need it for!! i'll be buying more soon!!!
5	1396828800	Such great quality. This product is even more exciting that its waterproof. So glad I chose this brand. Stood out far more than any other!
3	1396828800	As the title says, they look nice and are small, but the write speed is snail slow. I got under 6mb/s while another USB 2 drive I have of the same capacity will write at 15mb/s. If you are in a hurry, keep looking. If you just want a small and tough little USB drive, this will do the trick.
4	1396828800	I really liked the sleek design and size of this flash drive. However, it would be really nice to have a cover at the end to keep dust and debris from getting inside, especially when carrying it in a purse or handbag.
5	1396828800	I have been using two Silicon Power 64GB Firma ZN F80 USB 2.0 Flash Drive, Gray Aluminium (SP064GBUF2F80V1S) for 8 mts without any problem. Some reviews I read comments the HD came out of the cylinder when they unplugged or lost when carrying them around. I have not had this experience after 8 mts. Maybe the company found a better way to seal them. Whatever the case, I am a satisfied customer and will recommend them. Don't be surprised when you get it, as they are real small. Not quite an inch & 1.4th long. By the way, I carry two of them on my belt hook just in case.
5	1396828800	This drive is durable, lightweight and convenient. It has plenty of storage space for my needs and fits nicely on my key ring. Also, the price was right.
5	1396828800	The package was shipped and arrived quickly. They were packaged well. I bought them because the price was right and I wanted flash drives that I could put on my key ring and in my briefcase.They are small and durable but are not so small that they are difficult to manage (I have l big fingers that don't work well with small objects).I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family.
5	1396742400	I really love this product. A little time finding and downloading an app., now I can view files or movies right on my phone, no need for a computer, or loading them directly onto my phone. Ingenious!
5	1396742400	Does everything you'd expect it to. The bonus is that it makes it even easier to transfer from mobile to PC just by switching it over, awesome :-)
5	1396742400	I have more than one Android device and this is perfect to handle large media files back and forth.  I was a bit concerned it wasn't USB 3.0, but at the price I couldn't go wrong.  It is more than fast enough to play videos without a problem.  I've recommended this to friends who have also ordered for themselves.  A ring for a keychain would have been nice, but still 5-stars as is.
5	1396742400	I have a 16GB Nexus 10, and among other things, we use it for the kids to watch their DVDs that I ripped. This plugs right in and is totally unobtrusive. Works like a charm.
3	1396742400	It's a 2.0 USB Flash Drive, but I am looking for 3.0, which is faster, but if 2.0 is fine with you - get it because it's slim and all metal.
5	1396656000	this drive transfers very quickly, and is very portable due to it's size, keyring, and open design so that you don't need to take it off your keys to plug in and transfer data
5	1396656000	I have tried OTG cables in the past, they let me hook up a SD card reader to my Nexus 7 which I use to playback video from my GoPro.I wanted to use this OTG drive to supplement memory for my HD Razr Maxx phone & it works! I used USB OTG Checker from the Google marketplace to confirm that the phone works with OTG, which it does.Using ES File Explorer I can easily see that 14.71 GB is available and its simple enough to transfer files to this new drive.The only caution I should mention is that this drive is very small so you may want to add a split ring key ring to the drive so you do not easily lose it.
5	1396656000	Look can be deceiving I have purchased several different brands you probably have heard of some of them, generally they work well.  What is special about this one OTHER that the size is the postive fashion you can attach it to you key ring ... some of the other BIG names had a beaded snap key change of a couple of inches BUT I have lost several jump drives this way and NOT realized it until days later.  The payload 64GB is impressive, the cost is much lower that other big name brands for the same payload and unless I loose my car keys I won't loose this one wish I had found it sooner.  Hey seller keep the price reasonable and I think I will buy another one just because I like it so much .... GOOD JOB happy customer :-)
5	1396656000	Great drive with usB and micro usB. Fantastic price. Great combo and 32gig .It's very small and very fast. Great deal.
4	1396656000	Am really happy with the build quality and size. It fits perfectly on a key ring and barely notice its existence.on the specs size, its capacity is awesome but it being 2.0, the speed is on the low side.But happy with the purchase, 100%
5	1396656000	Terrible ergonomic for grabbing, but I gave it 5 stars.For daily use, it forces me extra effort and is rather frustrating.This is the one of a few items that I compromise its practicality in my life.It is like a sexy high heels for fashion, not comfortable, but stylish.It has snug fit on USB ports and you might feel it too tight.
4	1396656000	This flash drive works as promised for the most part. I did have an issue with it not reading on a USB port but not sure if it was the machine or the flash drive. Also it would be nice if they made something to cover the UBS end of it to protect from damage.
5	1396656000	Arrived as promised and wound up being a lot more smaller, lighter and sleeker than I imagined. Loads fine into whichever computer I plug it into. And it fits nonchalantly onto my key ring. Will definitely buy from Silicon Power again!
5	1396656000	Works pretty good, very small, handy and convinient to carry anywhere. Gets little bit hot if you are using it for long.  Got in very good price from amazon.
5	1396569600	With my phone (Nexus 5) mounting this drive is not automatic. But once I got the proper app to do the job (Nexus USB OTG File Manager) it works just as I had hoped.
5	1396569600	As an IT professional I find using USB drives a very convenient way to keep any of the tools I may need on hand.  The problem I've had with them is the majority are made of plastic and have failed unexpectedly.  For example I've had the male USB plug on 2 USB drives break right off rendering them useless (they were made of plastic, not metal). Also, I've had the retractable types fail as well, causing them to be more difficult to plug in properly.With this USB drive design, both of the issues I've discussed have been eliminated.  The Aluminum uni-body design means this USB drive has no moving parts that will fail from repeated use.  Also being made from aluminum, it's durability is far superior to the plastic/plastic metal combination designed devices.The design is also well though out because the &#34;ring shape&#34; at the end make handling the device easy plus it allows for it to be carried on a key ring or on a small to medium sized carabiner (I use a petzl spirit 3D carabiner with mine).  The exterior has a nice finish that resists fingerprints.  Finally, if you are a mac user, this USB will blend in perfectly with the look of your aluminum constructed computer.The only negatives I can come up with are: 1. This drive isn't USB 3.0 and 2. 64GB is the max size offering.  Neither one are a deal breaker for me because none of the computers at my work or home currently use USB 3.0 and 64 GB is still a lot of space.  SP does make USB 3.0 and higher capacity drives, just not in this particular design.Overall, I am very pleased with this device and l think you will be as well.
5	1396569600	This is a unique product that is very useful to add temporary memory to smart phone and tablets without loading files/music/pictures to permanent memory
4	1396569600	The best USB drive I ever bought, especially for anyone who Owens Samsung mobile devices to transfer files from a pc to the phone. The only bad thing is u can't hung it with your keys the cap will come off and you loose the drive, beside that it's a great innovation and product.
5	1396569600	this is exactly what i needed . i was running out of space on my phone, this is the perfect way to transfer all my photos, and documents to a portable flash drive, very easy to use.
5	1396569600	I have problems when I try to copy pictures from my cell to my pc, using a cable or a Bluetooth dongle. This 32GB is great. One side connects to the cellphone and the other is a standard USB connector. I really like it and I'm glad I got two of them.
4	1396569600	The flash drive transferred data from my PC just fine, but I haven't been able to satisfactorily transfer data to my Nexus 7 tablet running Android 4.4.2.  I've tried using several USB file manager apps from Google Play store, and I get the message asking to connect the flash drive as a USB drive, but nothing shows up in the file manager app.  The impression I had originally gotten was that the Nexus 7 would be all ready to accept the flash drive w/o additional drivers, but that seems not to be the case.  Otherwise, I do like the small form factor, although it might get lost easily.  The slot for a strap for the microUSB connector cover is a nice touch, but it would be better if one were provided on the flash drive body, itself.  Another complaint is that the drive does get warm to hot quickly and also appears to drain the battery quickly.  Knowing that, I would only transfer data to the tablet, and not leave the flash drive plugged in for any length of time.  If anyone knows how to really make this work w/ Nexus 7, that info would be greatly appreciated.
4	1396569600	Have not had a lot of time to use much. Thus far works as advertised and for the cost is very inexpensive 16G of memory.  Looking forward to using with micro USB on my Android phone.
4	1396569600	I didn't buy this to use with a handheld device, I bought it as an inexpensive, high capacity flash drive capable of backing up everything on my PC. I've tested it and it works according to expectation. My only concern is it's very smallness. So I've tethered it to a USB extension cord. I can't lose it now.Great product.
4	1396569600	Did not have enough knowledge on my part to determine that the memory would or would not work on my phone.  The industry is like the medical profession or lawyers that set their language such that the consumer is able to determine what is useful or not.
3	1396569600	This was a good deal and it holds a lot of data and it has been reliable.My concern is that the chip that holds the data in the metal enclosure will slide out.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye once while walking with it that something had fallen.  Luckily, I looked for it and it was the memory chip that had fallen out.  I was able to slide it back in but it keeps falling out.  I have started carrying it in a ziploc baggie so that I do not lose it.I have contacted the company and their response has been that this must have resulted from misuse and is not their responsibility.  This is not from misuse.  It rarely travels from my car stereo except when I want to add mp3s to it.  I also bought it because it was sold as being a rugged USB drive in a metal case.However, it still works and I am careful with it.  I am just a little disappointed that the company did not feel any responsibility.
5	1396569600	I have a Nexus tablet and the OTG drive works both as hard drive as well as an adaptor for any other USB drive.  Works great.rl
5	1396569600	This is a VERY handy device.  I originally ordered one and liked it enough to follow up with a re-order of two.  It allows me to clear a lot of real estate on my phone to the flash, making the phone faster and more reliable.
5	1396569600	I needed a high-capacity Flash Drive that I could save important messages and photos from my Android and then also transfer them to my desktop computer.  Then along came Silicon Power Mobile!  The perfect solution to my needs!  And at a great price!  Have already put it to good use and couldn't be happier!
5	1396569600	Solid tiny drive. About the size of the nail on my index finger! I have not tested the speed yet but very happy.
4	1396569600	I was shocked at how tiny this is.  Fits on key chain unobtrusively.  So far it's lived up to it's claims.  Very well made metal, not cheap plastic. I gave it a 4 star rating because it should have a protective cap or plug for the USB connection end.  After time I'm afraid it may pick up particles from my purse or pockets.
5	1396569600	Actually shows as another drive. Still testing it.Great for backups. Haven't tried to play music yet. But for the price I'm very happy.
5	1396483200	I have bought this flash drive in several sizes and in quantity.  They are outstanding.  Sleek design thats great on a keychain.  Haven't had one issue!  Would (and do) buy again.  Price is awesome too.
3	1396483200	This thing goes in your computer like metal on metal scraping.  Hard to believe this is good for the long term use of your USB ports.  Next time will spend extra on a more quality drive.
1	1396483200	Worked great for a month and now it's a brick. A very tiny brick, but a brick all the same. I'll not be purchasing another SP thumb drive. Not Recommended.
5	1396483200	Great storage capacity and it is very practical to carry around everywhere with your keys! I would recommend it for anyone that constantly has to be pulling information from various computers as well as just keeping important information (like those cat pictures you like so much :p)
5	1396396800	Nice drive fits well on keychain and wont fall off.  Like it doesnt have bloatware on it would buy again
5	1396396800	Super sleek and great quality....love this buy!Tiny little gadget with incredible storage. We use ours for storing music files.I definitely recommend this item for purchase.
5	1396396800	Like others have stated, this flash drive is a little different, so it doesn't easily slide in and click like others, but it's all metal and sturdy, which is more important to me.  The ring is connected to the drive as all just one piece of aluminum, so you don't have to worry about it breaking off.  The only suggestion for the manufacturer is to come up with something to cover the plug, even if it's just a silicon cap.  And, having 32GB in a drive smaller than your thumb, is pretty cool!
5	1396396800	It is just what I expected.  Very sturdy feeling.  It gets hot when plugging in for a long period time, but it does not bother me. Good product. It's the first time I use this product and I hope it will last.
5	1396396800	Silicon Power 32GB Firma ZN F80 Gray Aluminium Flash Drive is great little flash drive. The Firma F80 is a little on the small side and you will have to be careful not to lose it. I tied it physically to another thumb drive so won't lose them. But beside this issue the flash drive is great. I took all my work file and personal files off a 2 GB flash drive and moved them on to this one. I am definitely glad I have this device and would definitely recommend it to others.Thank you for reading my review.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation. A review was not promised to the supplier in exchange for the sample.
4	1396310400	The drive gets very hot very fast when it's plugged into my phone. That would be the only con so far.I'm using a Samsung Galaxy s3 and a MacBook Pro. I'm able to move and read data without the standard barriers that are usually encountered. It doesn't require additional software and no cords. I carry it around on my keys which great because I almost always have it on me.
5	1396310400	This USB drive does what it is supposed to do.  I do not measure speed test, but the performance is fine by me.  It is durable and I have purchased 1 of these and I like it enough to buy one more for myself and 1 for a relative.
5	1396310400	I move things on and off my phone either by plugging it into my computer (using my USB cable) or emailing things to myself so I get them on my computer. It's a pain sometimes and if you want a larger file for your phone or tablet but don't want to take up internal memory.This little device is really neat. It can plug into any USB port or any micro USB port. So I can plug it into my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone and copy files onto or off of it. You have to know how to get around your storage files. I use a free app called ES File Explorer which gives me a sort of Windows like file system.I also used it with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. Since that has a proprietary plug, I usedSamsung EPL-1PL0BEGXAR USB Connection Kitwhich allows me to plug any USB device into the tablet.I used the Silicon Power Mobile X10 on both my phone and tablet and had no trouble getting it to be recognized as well as to transfer files. I did not try to watch anything (video) on it but what a great idea for putting movies on it for travel.It has a cap for the micro USB end and the USB end is open. The cap has an opening if you want to attach it to something.Hard to believe that my first PC had 10 MB of storage and this has more than 3,000 the capacity in such a tiny drive.One note: it does get warm while in use. I've kept a close eye on it and it never gets so hot that I'm worried about it burning up but it still gets warm.I was provided a sample for testing and review.
5	1396310400	This product already has been placed into full use and is excellent.  It's exactly as described and it's performance so far is  terrific.  This was a smart buy!
5	1396310400	Excellent product. This a well designed thumb drive. It is easy to insert into the USB slot on your computer and it has 32 GB of storage. Great buy
3	1396310400	It needs to be pushed hard to plug in. Then it shows only 30 GB of space. Some kind of protective cap would be good, to protect against dust and sand . Wouldn't put it on a key chain if you put your keys in your pocket, feels like it could bend or break .
5	1396310400	First flash drive to actually have as many GBs as advertised --  full 64 gigs! Wunderbar! Too new to comment on durability.
1	1396224000	I purchased this flash drive because of the form factor.  I always need a flash drive around the office and I have lot of low capacity drives sitting at my desk and when I go into another room I forget to bring them with me.  This was a perfect design to clip on my key chain and carry with me at all times without being intrusive.  It has stood up to the abuse of being in my pocket with my keys.  The read speeds seem to be ok for USB 2,0 but the write speed are really slow even for small text files under 50kb.  The worst part about this device would have to be the fact that it finally died on me just over 3 months of use.  I have been unable to recover the data from the drive, I used the Silicon Power recovery tool with not luck and their customer service has been no help.  I would not buy this again because others have experienced the same issues.  I will go with a more recognizable brand with a similar form factor in the future.
5	1396224000	An amazing product and just what I was needing. It's small, well built and versatile. I no longer have to carry an OTG cable to move things from my phone to my computer or tablet and vice versa. I would recommend this to anyone who transfers data between devices.
5	1396224000	Very high quality and great price. Looks better than plastic cheepo USB's. It is a tight fit to USB port, same as other metal cased USB drives, I don't see this as a negative.
3	1396224000	Everything one would expect from a flash drive. Easily scratched by computer when plugged in. Otherwise, its a solid product.
5	1396224000	Fits right on my key-chain, perfect for mobility. It does get a little hot when plugged in for a while doing data transfers but nothing that will be uncomfortable to the touch. I've used it for over a year and had no issues so far.
5	1396137600	Yes, durable. I can't tell you how many times someone has brushed up against my computer and broke my flash drives, and that is not possible with this design. Added bonus is it fits right on my key chain, impossible to misplace or forget. Very good quality at a very thrifty price.
5	1396137600	Worked great. Made a start up disk of my Windows 8 computer quickly. Seemed to work much faster than older flash drives.
5	1396051200	I ordered one for myself and my husband and we were very pleased, it was fast and arrived quickly. We liked it so much a co-worker actually had me purchase one for her as well.
5	1396051200	It's been a few years since I've bought a thumb drive but this one is definitely my favorite.  Nice and compact with a snug fit.  I easily formatted this one to be extra storage for my XBOX360.
5	1396051200	I am using this flash drive with HTC One X international edition (Android 4.2.2) I have tried various numbers of regular size flash drives, except one SanDisk from Radioshack, none of them are recognized on my phone.This flash drive works pretty well, just like you would use regular size flash drive on your laptop. The size of this one is about 1 inch long, including microUSB tip.According to USBDeview, the write speed is about 7.5MB/s and read speed is 20.1MB/s (but with truecopy, I have gotten 12MB/s write speed)Just one thing that I may have to check further, I just played a 3 minute video to check if it stutters and it did not, but the drive felt little warm to touch. I need to check how will it work if I am to watch a movie or something on the plane, including the power consumption (how quickly my phone discharges).
5	1395964800	Speed is acceptable, size is great, durability is great. I've had this drive on my keychain for almost a year now. I use it about once a week on average and it's still working with no issues. Very solid and compact not to mention handy. I'd like to seed this I'm usb 3.0, but it gets decent speeds for a usb 2 device.Would recommend
5	1395964800	So far so good. This is actually the second one I have purchased now. I like this one because it is still working (I have the worst luck with flash drives operating for more than a couple months). It fits into USB ports perfectly, unlike other styles that you practically have to hold in place. You don't have to worry about flipping this part to open the drive or swing that part, or take the lid off, you just plug it in! So it is easy, it is the most functional and easy to use flash drive I have ever had! Now here to hoping it keeps working for a long time!
5	1395964800	This is the second one I've bought.  I love the way it fits on a toggle or a keyring.  And, yes, it not only looks good, but works.
5	1395964800	Small, and affordable i have five movies on it and about ten Autocad files, and i still have 25GB left.
2	1395964800	It's easy to use and should fit well on any keychain .... BUT, mine only lasted for 6 month or so, after it doesn't get recognized by any PC ... so whatever i had on it is lostI do not believe it's a quality product
5	1395878400	Seems well built and shouldn't break when added to my key ring. The loop makes it easy to remove from the USB port.
5	1395878400	having this on your key chain allows you to always be able to save anything. whether it be at work or home or on the go this is a must have for computer users.
3	1395878400	It is really takes some time to copy data. I am pretty sure it is not caused by my desktop, a workstation.
5	1395878400	I own both this flash drive and the Kingston DTSE9, which is very similar (capless, all-metal design). Both are great drives. I think this drive may have a slight advantage in long-term durability, since supposedly the DTSE9 suffers from a problem where the metal casing separates from the innards of the drive (though this hasn't happened to mine). In terms of putting the drive on a keyring, this is definitely the superior drive... the thinner loop works much better on a key ring. However, the flare of the loop may obstruct USB ports that are located side-by-side (ie the ports on many laptops). The DTSE9 does not obstruct other ports. Both drives are pretty good-looking, but this drive wins out because the Kingston has a dissimilar metal that lines its loop, making the inside of the loop look jagged. As far as fit goes, my DTSE9 is better... it fits perfectly in all USB ports I have tried. This Silicon Power drive is always very snug in the USB port.. sometimes so tight as to be concerning. There are two reasons that I ultimately like this drive better than the Kingston. First, this drive is waterproof. A lot of flash drives will survive water, but I like that this drive explicitly states that it is waterproof. The other reason is heat. My DTSE9 gets very hot, while this drive hardly gets warm. I don't think the heat is really damaging (silicon can get pretty hot before it is damaged) but I still prefer to have a cool drive.
4	1395878400	impressive data storage in a tiny but solid package; tight fit into USB port but feels very secure.  so far so good.
4	1395792000	Have used for about a month without a problem. Keychain keeps it handy. Moves between mac and windows no issues
1	1395792000	My major concern: the big house is very very slow.It has a good looking with metal case and is a easy carrying one. But the writing speed is slow at about 2M/sec. If you want to put in something 30gb it may take for ever to finish. I don't know why some reviewers said this flashdrive is pretty fast which is misleading. Maybe I am not lucky. Another drawback is that this one becomes really hot after 1 minute of data transfer. I will not buy any Silicon Power again.
5	1395705600	Very cute, fits into the USB port perfectly, and is very nice-looking. I really thought it would be larger, for some reason! Would buy more!
4	1395705600	This product is super compact with a quality design. Works fast and I am very pleased with this quality product.
5	1395705600	Works as it should; fast file transfers; looks really cool.  VERY small; looks like the tab on a can of soup.Item shipped very quickly from the vendor.
5	1395705600	Flash drive is great.  Product just as stated - fits great on a key ring -  and sturdy!  Great buy!
4	1395705600	It was a lot smaller than i thought it was going to but it does its job and works great
5	1395705600	Recommended purchase!Compact simple, it will easily fit in purse.Not the fastest in its class, but okay for the price.
4	1395619200	The product is small, very nice and very good finishes.The speed is somewhat slow, but it is what they promise in the product description.It is a very nice flash drive for the price!
5	1395619200	I love this little thing! I really have no complaints and I would buy it again in a heartbeat, and recommend it to a friend.Pros: Big storage space, and choice for storage spaceReads and writes very fastCaplessAttaches very nicely to keyringSmallFits into USB slot very nicely - it will not come out if you don't try to pull it outRelatively inexpensiveLooks really niceShipped fast, nicely packagedVery durable*Cons: No LED light to indicate activity. This is literally the only complaint I can think of, so if you're considering this thing, get it!*It feels like it won't break and can take some roughness. The case says it is waterproof, shockproof, dustproof, and scratchproof. Waterproof was one of the things I was looking for when I searched for a flash drive. I believe all flash drives are technically waterproof, in that if they get wet, AND THEY ARE DRIED THOROUGHLY BEFORE BEING PLUGGED IN, there will be no damage or memory loss, since there is no electric charge or moving parts in it. For this one, if it is splashed, there will not be a problem at all, since all of the electronics are completely on the inside (you can't see the USB connector). This is one of my favorite things about this drive.
5	1395619200	Slick, elegant design, solid-as-a-rock build quality, great price. What's not to love about this drive? Read and write is super fast, runs seamlessly on Windows 7 and Mac OS X (Mountain Lion and Mavericks). According to Silicon Power, the company who makes the product, it is waterproof and dust-proof. I was a little hesitant to buy a flash drive with no cover on the plug, but as well built as this thing is, I don't doubt the company's claims. They make external hard drives that are mil-spec and can be submerged in a meter of water for half an hour and still work, so that says a lot about their commitment to quality.What sold me on it was the design, because I am a design nut, but what really drove the point home was when I got the thing in my hands and felt the quality for myself. The look and feel of the product is similar to the aluminum MacBook Pro, if not even a little bit sturdier. I can't imagine you would regret buying this flash drive, especially at such a fantastic price. I'll be buying a couple more myself.
5	1395532800	I already had one, but wanted more to hold movies.  The cast is near indestructible.  Fits nicely on my key ring and is the best price I found here in the states and also Toronto.  A great buy.
5	1395532800	Extremely solid construction and works well. Not bad transfer rates for a 2.0 and very durable to leave on a keychain all day so that it doesn't get lost.
4	1395532800	Awesome little flash drive. Looks bigger in the picture then it actually is. That's why it gets 4 out of 5.
5	1395532800	Purchased the 8gb version to store personal docs and crypto keys on my keychain. Barely noticeable and very small. Transfer speed is acceptable. Will be purchasing the bigger versions shortly.
5	1395532800	overall design is a plus. on top of that, large capacity at a good price. just format this thing when you get it because as with all drives there is unnecessary shitake on there.
5	1395532800	Fantastic. Beautiful look and very practical. I'll recommend every one to bay this USB because doesn't cost too much but is good
5	1395446400	It's a pleasure to open a flash drive that doesn't come pre-loaded with extraneous files.  You get the whole 64GB.  It arrived formatted for Windows, but I like to start with native Mac formatting. Mac Disk Utility reformatted it for Mac Journaled in seconds.  It fits the USB port snugly but not too much so.  The shape is ergonomic for carrying and for pulling out of the USB port.
2	1395446400	This failed after 10 days. Just stopped working with my computers. I liked the design of the unit , very small , classy , smooth, nice ring for clipping on to a carabiner..Anyway, it is going back to AMAZON for a refund. I may try another 64GB unit from another company..
5	1395360000	The Silicon Power Firma ZN F80 flash drive is a well designed and relatively high capacity drive that works great. The drive itself is only the width of a USB plug (so there&#8217;s no external housing that adds to the bulk and width of the drive). This makes it very unobtrusive on a key chain. The drive has a keyring hole/loop on the end, which allows one to attach it to a keyring. I found an added bonus of this keyring hole was that it made it easy to insert and remove the drive.I ran some durability tests on the drive. It survived water being poured on it, as the drive is in fact waterproof. It is also dust proof and shock proof. I did some drop tests at various heights, even about 20 feet, and the drive survived it all without showing even a scratch. Needless to say, this drive is extremely durable and of high quality - perfect for placement on a keychain where it&#8217;s stuffed in a pocket or used in inclement weather.This drive fits very easily on my existing keychain, and is about the size of a regular sized key. I have about 6-10 things on my key ring, and I had no trouble using the drive in my computer with the keys hanging off the rest of the key ring.Read and write speeds were around advertised. Write averaged at 13 MB/s and read was around 27 MB/s. Overall, excellent speeds for USB 2.0.I do wish Silicon Power made this drive in USB 3.0, as the design is simply phenomenal and is extremely durable and high quality.Overall, the Firma ZN F80 flash drive is great for those looking for an everyday, high quality, and durable flash drive to place on their keychains. It&#8217;s another great product made by Silicon Power!I was provided with this item as a sample in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation. If you have any questions, feel free to comment below or contact me in my profile.
2	1395360000	Ya - it's cheap, convenient and portable... but holy crap is this thing slow.  As I write this, my computer is estimating a transfer time of  of 18 hours (putting some movies on it) for 7GB!!!  If you extrapolate that to the maximum capacity ---  (7) 4.5 x 17 --- it would take 3.18 DAYS to fully load this thing up.3 days upload for 32GB... not so buenoTotally ridiculous.  I'll probably be returning it
5	1395273600	It's sleek and able to use in Mac / PCHad used it only couple of times not sure of how long it last etc it's not encrypted nor password protected
5	1395273600	This is the best usb 2.0 drive I have bought for my keychain and if I ever want to get another I wouldn't think of getting another brand. Very light weight and very reliable. Fast speeds for usb 2.0 on a slim profile.
5	1395273600	When I purchased it, I though it would be bigger, but honestly, it was so slim and soooo stylish. I like that it fits in my key chain very well.
5	1395273600	I just received this metal cased 32GB flash drive.  I have tried it in two separate PC's, both HP, and the fit is excellent.  The capacity appears to be true as well.  I will not be using it anytime soon, but aseems like a quality product.
5	1395273600	Plenty fast, well designed and built. It does get a little hot to the touch if you're writing a lot of data to it, but other than that, it's perfect.
5	1395273600	it is actually smaller size than i thought but its still very nice for its pricei just love it
5	1395187200	These always turn heads when I use them. Great devices and I plan on buying more. Reliable, tough, and versatile.
5	1395187200	love it. good to wear it on my key chain. very hard, not easy to break~ very good looking drive!~~~~
5	1395187200	This usb flash drive is great.  It's small and convenient.  It works like it's supposed to and I have no problems with the flash drive.
5	1395187200	Great design. Simple. Sturdy. The BEST for putting on a keychain:  it WILL stand up to heavy use!  I accidentally left one in a pants pocket that went through the wash:  I shook it out and let it dry overnight, and it was just fine!  (And without a cap!)
4	1395100800	I was actually shopping for a USB 3.0 version and this one showed up in the search. I didn't notice it was only a 2.0. It works just like it should and makes a nice, sturdy key ring thumb drive (which is what I wanted). I would definitely buy the product again if it was came out as a 3.0 model.
5	1395100800	Good design with the large hole so it will last longer than some of the others I have had.  Wish it was USB 3.0, but happy with 2.0.
5	1395100800	I used it at school very handy and arrive on time and economical for student like me who is always on the go.
5	1395100800	Has very good capacity, but the design is the real win. Fits snug in USB ports, small, but not too small so as to get lost, the material is tough, and the loop is very handy. I recommend to anyone on the go!
5	1395100800	Perfect. Little smaller than what I thought but not complaining. Its always with me. My main problem was I always forgot my drive when I needed it...but now it stays on my badge
5	1395100800	This is about the best flash drive I've ever had.  It is great quality and a very simple design.  Everyone I show this to wants to know where I got it.
5	1395100800	I wanted an extra usb memory for work, liked the size and design, fits the job perfectly.  I recommend it.
5	1395014400	Well made flash memory unit -- sturdy, smaller than any of the keys I keep on the same keyring -- and lots of memory.  I've been using it for just a week, but it's just what I've been looking for, and I'll be carrying it with me all the time.  Highly recommended!
5	1395014400	What can I say? It works great and does exactly what it is supposed to do. It is very small, as well.
5	1394928000	Love it, just amazing. Haven't had any problems with this since I received it. I put my tv shows on it and leave it in my tv and just enjoy it.
5	1394928000	This USB is so fast! Also I love its design to be hooked to my key chain, so there is no chance I can loose it. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a fast USB drive!
5	1394841600	I LOVE this flash drive.  It's slim, small, discreet-perfect for travel.  Very durable.  I keep it in a travel bag and had no issues.
5	1394841600	I used this 64 GB USB 2.0 drive to copy motion data files and text forshipment to Japan, the size of this Silicon Power drive was appropriatefor the volume that I had, and the unit is designed well and has a metalcasing, which is much better than plastic, especially when shippedvia international mails.  I have 2 other USB drives from Silicon Power, and have hadsimilar experience with copying large amounts of data and mailing, and willcontinue to use their line of flash drives.
1	1394841600	Two things, one it's a whole lot smaller than it appears in the picture. It's 1 5/8&#34; long X 1/2&#34; wide at it's smaller width. It's so small I think it could be lost or misplaced easily.Secondly I didn't think it was going to go into my brand new PC. I had to push it really hard. It did go in and it worked but not so sure it's going to be good on the pc bus port as it's very gritting and difficult to push in. The original thumb or flash drives were small enough, they don't need to too tiny.God Bless.
5	1394841600	I bought this for around $50 and I was very happy with the price. And now it's even cheaper! It works great, I keep it on my keychain and I don't have to worry about anything happening to it because it's water, dust, shock, and vibration proof!
5	1394755200	Bought one of those about a year ago and liked it so much that I bought a second just as extra storage. Case is very solid. I keep one on my keychain so it gets exposed to the elements at times and have had no issues with it what so ever. If I need to get another thumb drive this will be the one I come back to.
5	1394755200	No problems so far, works as it should. I like it for its size, small and durable and can be placed on a key ring.
2	1394755200	The drive claims to be 2.0, but data exchange speeds are terribly slow compared to my other drive of identical specification.  On this basis, I cannot recommend this item.
5	1394668800	The Silicon POwer 32GB Firma Zn blah blah blah is really a great little flash drive. I put mine on my keychain and use it every day. The aluminium casing takes a beating against my keys and stays strong. I like holding the ring of keys in my fist as I pull the drive out of the USB slot. Feels good. Do recommend.
5	1394668800	i wold buy it again and again and again in fact i have 3 awesome for the $ $ $ i carry one all day on my keys and i beat on my stuff vary rugged also water proof or vary resistant cuz its seen a puddle or 2
5	1394668800	This was everything I wanted.... we needed something to store and transfer music and photos with and this fits the bill....
1	1394668800	My computer stopped recognizing the drive, while I was using it. I installed the recovery software from the Silicon-Power website and the software didn't recognize the drive either. Don't know how/why. So, all my data is gone!Tried it on a different computer...same problem. This flash drive is a dud.
5	1394582400	Excellent product. Works well. It's incredible to carry 64gb storage in such a slender, sleek design. It's nice for your keyring as well.
5	1394582400	This flash drive delivers as promised.  It's easy to use and nearly indestructible.  It's shape fits on my keychain better than other flash drives I've tried.  My only minor criticism is that it's sometimes difficult to tell if it's fully inserted into the USB port.  Would definitely buy again.
5	1394582400	Was looking for a &#34;Key Ring&#34; Flash drive. This is perfect for my Elecrical/Software group, even had one go through the laundry and still works just fine.
5	1394582400	Amazing, solid, tiny with HUGE capacity. What I like the most, is that contacts are not exposed. Product highly recommended~!!!
5	1394496000	I like that silicon power brand. Because of in my country, that brand is famous also. that product is modernest. So,I like that SP brand. I am from MYANMAR.
5	1394496000	There's no way to beat this amount of storage for this amount of money. All right on your keyring. The device installs extraordinarily quickly, without any of the frills of some thumb drives. The speed has been great, and I love this purchase: FIVE STARS
5	1394496000	This drive has been an amazing addition to my key ring. I never forget it and am able to take it with me without getting lost in my bag.
1	1394496000	Drive looks great and worked ok at first, then became so slow as to be unusable.  I would not recommend buying this product.
5	1394409600	I have not even plugged this in since it is meant to be a present. With that being said it feels very solid and I am sure my friend will get quite a bit of use out of it. I was able to take it and have it engraved despite the small size and it looks great!
5	1394323200	We have purchased many different brands of a USB flash drives on Amazon and this has been the best one so far!  I did not realize how small it actually is, so it fits great on my husband's key chain. It works well and looks good too. He asked me to order more of this particular brand.
1	1394323200	I use this drive daily and all of a sudden it will not be recognized by the computer.  More important than the cost of the drive is the data lost on it.  Very disappointed.
5	1394236800	This is the smallest thumb drive I've ever seen.  Don't even notice it on my keychain and I carry it everywhere.
5	1394236800	Very compact, yet sturdy (shall see if it withstands the test of time though). More convenient to hold than other similar products. Not the fastest, but I would not expect that given the price and the fact that it's a USB 2.0 stick.
5	1394236800	This product is the winner of multiple awards, and it was quickly evident why. First off, it's small. After years of clunky, chunky flash drives, I was surprised by one measuring less than two inches or so in length. Next, it doesn't require a cap. I've lost more covers to things over my lifetime than I care to consider, so this was a definite plus. Other users on Amazon swear that it is in fact waterproof. I like it too much to test that theory, but I'll take their word for it. The circle on top is easy to thread through a key chain, or in my case, a carabiner. No messing with needle-size openings and embroidery thread here. The same opening makes for a convenient grip when removing from USB ports.As someone who hates dealing with instruction manuals and set-up guides, I was glad to find that all I had to do with this flash drive was plug it into the port, let the driver install itself, and then save away. (Note: an internet connection will be necessary so that your OS can find the drivers for the self-install.) The saving process is incredibly fast, enough so that I could work on my Powerpoint directly from the drive without any noticeable lag time as I (compulsively) saved. One less thing to store on the desktop. The 64 GB storage is also pretty amazing, especially when the price tag is in the neighborhood of thirty-four dollars, plus free shipping if you have Amazon Prime. Not too shabby.Lastly, this drive really is fingerprint- and scratch-proof. I had it in my pocket with keys, and it still looks like new. No fingerprints, either, which is remarkable since I had my grubby paws all over it as I worked on my presentation between flight delays, multiple airports/layovers, and a brief train ride. Color me impressed.All in all, the Silicon Power 64 GB Firma ZN F80 USB 2.0 Flash Drive was absolutely a worthwhile, durable purchase. It gave me one less thing to stress about in the midst of a hellish travel day. Just make sure you keep it attached to something, or it may get lost.alice[unblocked]
1	1394150400	Pros: Small form factor, well built construction.Cons: Died in less than 3 months.Will not buy from this manufacturer again.
5	1394150400	I like the smallnest and lots of memory very good price and fast shipping. Metal instead of plastic better reliability.
5	1394150400	What I like most about this USB stick is that it is less fragile than other ones that I have owned, despite not being more expensive. I do not know yet how long it will last, but as long as it will do its job I will be happy. I also do not find it particularly slow, as some seem to state. It is slower than my external hard drives, for sure, but not slower than other USB sticks I have owned from better known brands.
5	1394150400	This is really a nice little memory stick. No cap to deal with, just plug it in and go. Perfect for hanging on my keychain.
5	1394064000	This is a great carry along storage. Works great on key chain and blends right in with the other keys. I make it into an emergency pc repair drive.
5	1394064000	No complaints. Very cool design. Works well for the types and volume of files I need to store.  I would absolutely recommend this product.
5	1394064000	Love the design of this Flash Drive. Easy to hold, put on a key ring, and sturdy. I would recommend it to anyone.
5	1394064000	Fantastic design, feel and function.  So much better than plastic-cased USBs.  Goes on a key chain easily,  I'd buy again!
5	1394064000	I was drawn to the design and that I could put it on my keychain without having moveable parts to access the USB port. Overall, it's design is better than I had imagined. I'm very happy with the concept and look forward to using it for a very long time.
4	1394064000	Great, Small and Elegant. At the moment, working good. I will recommend this product to anyone who want something innovative
5	1393977600	I have only used it a couple times so far, but it seems to work great! I recommend it to anyone that wants a small flash drive (it is tiny)
5	1393977600	Will be buying another. Love the thin case, as well as the fact it is made from aluminum. Works awesome.
5	1393891200	Great form factor and design.  Electronics work as advertised. This is a perfect example of designed simplicity. Absolutely no excess.
4	1393891200	This is a nice flash drive, well worth the price. While it is not the fastest nor the most secure; it is the best value I have used in a while.I provide tech support to family, friends, and a few companies. When I get called about 60% of the time, it means I need to be on site. I need to take a number of files that will find and restore systems. I use the flash drives to boot up dead systems, find and restore forgotten passwards, kill virus. I even carry windows 8 on one section and a VDI of OSX on another.My old flash drive of choice was a IMATION that is no longer being made. I still use it but it only holds 8GB and is now almost 4 years old.  Carrying a 1TB 2.5 inch usb drive would be great but much harder (for me) to keep in my bag, thus I carry a 32GB abd 64GB SP drive on my key chain.
5	1393804800	This little jewel is tough enough and small enough to go right on your key ring or in your pocket. I carry my first one when I work on home PCs.  I added portableapps.com utilities for PC cleanup and virus scan. It has been very helpful for that with plenty of breathing room.  I just got this second one to carry around for emergency backup at work.  No personal stuff on this one. It is funky fresh and empty, ready for user backup just prior to a crash.  No running for an external drive for this guy. I wish they were all made this well and this small. I need a 64GB for imaging in place next.
4	1393804800	Tough, solid little drive. High capacity 32 Gig for a small price! Definitely does the job. There is no need to pay more.
4	1393804800	It seems work fine so far. But it is too tight for a frequent plug in and out. So I say it is not the best. However, the price is good.
2	1393804800	This is worth reading just for appreciating the irony inherent in the exchange. I'm assuming that, contrary to the packaging and the company's advertising, this device is not waterproof (but I won't test the issue):ME:Greetings! Is this USB drive fully submersible or simply &#34;splash&#34; resistant?Reply from SILICON POWER CUSTOMER SERVICE:Dear Customer,Thank you for taking your time to contact with us.  Base on your question, we would like to confirm and provide the following information as below:1. From the mail, did you already buy the flash drives?2. Regarding to the mail, our product is water-proof not waterproof which means it could only resistant water but if the inside part of the product become damp, it is not under our warranty.If there are any further questions or concerns, please feel free to let us know. Thank you for your patience and consideration.
5	1393718400	I'm sure I looked at the product dimensions when I was considering this purchase, but when I received it, it seems really small!  It's only a 1 1/4 inch, including the finger loop at the top.  That's not a drawback at all though.  At 64GB, I won't run out of room any time soon.  Solid metal body, with a tight fit in the USB port on my computer, and quick transfers on and off the device.  My old plastic body USB drive felt cheap and I always wondered if the metal part was going to one day pull free of the plastic.  I have plenty of room to take movies with me on the road so I don't need to worry about blowing the data usage on my cellphone.
5	1393718400	Nice flash drive that looks good and makes for a great gift.  Does what it's supposed to do and seems very durable.
5	1393718400	This is the sleekest design I've seen for a flash drive. Also, it's easy to travel with given that it can be clipped on a key chain or other such tether. And the price can't be beat.
5	1393718400	This works really great. The hole just fits well on my carabiner! The shell is so solid and it is great to carry around.
5	1393632000	Very light, and its aluminium so it wont break or crack easily. Im using it now and its awesome. Also its 32gb!
5	1393632000	Just what I needed to travel with. Hopefully not so small that I will lose it. I like the design.
5	1393545600	This is a great replacement for the 16GB USB drive that I lost recently -- and is much faster!  It seems really sturdy and solid.
5	1393545600	Love this usb stick. Cool finish and it's freaking tiny. Transfers are pretty quick. Overall I would recommend it to anyone.
5	1393545600	Small enough to put on a keychain and keep in your pocket, and made of metal so it's durable.  Great product!
5	1393545600	I like the brushed metal finish and the large capacity, and I like the fact that it easily clips on my keychain. Hard to misplace.
5	1393545600	Looks good on my keychain. I did have a problem when I pulled it out of my pc port...the insides slipped out of the metal shell. Easy fix, just super glued it and now its snugg. Why 5 stars? I left my keys in my pocket and washed and dried this thing....IT STILL WORKS!
1	1393545600	For whatever reason it doesn't work on my ps3, even though the ps3 detects the drive. I've tested this on several ps3s so i'm sure its the flash drive.
5	1393545600	I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a rugged drive to keep on their keychain. I love it.
5	1393459200	I needed USB drives for me and my son and bought these based on the reviews and the style. We tended to misplace our previous drives, but these go right on our key chain and are tough enough to handle it. I am very impressed with the design and ease of use. I would definitely recommend this product and would purchase again.
5	1393459200	Love the look and feel. I'd have preferred that the metal loop be slightly larger, but it fits my keyring just the same.
1	1393459200	This USB did not work on my Macbook Pro with OS Mavericks or on my Windows 7 PC.  Complete rip-off.  Better had gone with my tried and true brand of Kingston.
5	1393459200	Awesome design concept and affordable to boot. Downsides are that it is only USB 2.0 (as listed) and that it is slightly too snug inserting it into the USB port. I tried a couple and it was snug in each. I suspect that this will get better over time from wear, as it probably has more to do with the finish than the actual dimensions of the drive.I'm using the drive as my Windows 8.1 Recovery Drive, so the fact that it is USB 2 is not a big concern for me, though I do wonder why this particular form factor isn't available in USB 3. This usage makes the metal ring incorporated into the design all the better as I have it attached to the loop on one of my laptop slip cover zippers so that the recovery drive is always and easily with the laptop.
5	1393459200	This is one of the few Flash drives I've had that I haven't lost pretty much immediately. I've had a number of flash drives which attach to a keychain, but in general the clasps or rings have been weak and couldn't stand up to the day to day wear of people thrown around.With its all metal construction and integrated ring, this flash drive has really worked out well. My only gripe is that Silicon Power hasn't made a USB 3.0 version yet.
5	1393459200	It's strong, convenient, small, and the perfect size in GB.  I would recommend this to all my friends and family.
5	1393459200	Excellent product very well constructed. It's solid and does not feel flimsy like past thumb drives I have used. Highly recommended.
5	1393372800	This has a very small physical form factor.  It actually is made of aluminium instead of some plastic painted to look aluminium.  Stylish, quality product.
5	1393372800	very beautiful flash drive, but for me it's a small flash drive, i thought it would be little bit larger than it is.
5	1393372800	What more can you want? This product is great! I ordered two 32GB sticks and they both work well. Very small and sleek. They hold nicely on my keychain.
4	1393372800	Bought one to make sure it was what we were looking for, then bought 3 more. Small enough to easily carry on a key chain, the &#34;eye&#34; connects to a key chain security, the unit is tough and won't break or drop off. No bloatware. Well made and sturdy. Exactly what we were looking for. Have used several key chain drives in the past, and they all had problems that this one solves.
5	1393286400	Great little USB drive. Metal body with integral ring is awesome - fits on key ring and is very small; you won't even know it's there. No cap to lose and is water and dust resistant. Data writes fast to the drive. All around exactly what I needed.
2	1393286400	It moves slow when loading files and when viewing videos other than that its a zip drive. Wouldnt by any more though.
5	1393286400	I like to use PortableApps, and I needed to upgrade my size and choose this.  Sturdy, work at home with my Win 7 and at work with Win XP, with some use experience I can now travel with my portable dropbox now.Happy user.
5	1393200000	I like this product. It's design is very user friendly, especially in tight spaces. Good job. I will be back.....
5	1393200000	This item was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition and works great.  No complaints.  Plus it's nice, lightweight and small, meaning it's convenient to carry anywhere.
1	1393200000	I was really looking forward to getting an all metal flash drive as all my plastic would break before being outgrown.This one is physically great, but gave me trouble with several XP machines and finally died with very little to no use.
4	1393200000	Great Product, Normal Price.  This must be a popular product because there are not any special deals anywhere online or locally for this product and the prices are all the same.
5	1393113600	All aluminum, small, water proof, lifetime warranty! Works as described.Throw this on your key ring and you will be set.
5	1393113600	i love this so much, it comes in handy when im at work.haven't had any problems with it at all.exactly what I expected! :)
5	1393027200	I love it very easy to use. And holds alot of memory I would recommend this product. Thanks you for the product
5	1393027200	I have no complaints whatsoever. This flash drive not only looks great, it also performs great. I sell software that I package in flash drives for delivery to my clients. Until now no one ever mentioned or even noticed the flash drives that I issue, all of the sudden I get compliments from most. They like the keychain loop hole feature of this unit, and how solid it feels. I am happy (great price too).
1	1392940800	This technically works fine, but is extremely slow.  Every computer or device I use it on it takes forever to recognize.  Was trying to use it for installing windows from, but it takes so long to recognize I gave up and tried a different drive.Again, works fine but so slow I would not recommend.  I'll use it only for a backup flash drive now.can't even use it as a paperweight.
4	1392940800	I like it so far.  No issues.  I used to carry a bigger one.  Now this one blends in with my other keys.
4	1392854400	I ordered this flash drive to back up files on a computer that I was replacing. The drive works very well and I was able to save all of my files on the drive. I have no complaints about the product itself but the fact that I was charged $8 for shipping. This should have been shipped at regular Amazon shipping cost or less. The actual cost to ship this is probably around $2. The package and the envelope it arrived in could not have weighed more than 3 ounces. If you do not mind paying extra shipping charges then by all means order this through Amazon, otherwise check to see if a local store carries this flash drive.
5	1392854400	What I love about this flash drive is that it is metal and not plastic. I have had many flash drives but they have always been plastic and they are unable to stay securely on my key chain like this one. I had one break off but fortunately it stayed in my pocket. It's very nice to know that I have a flash drive with me secured to my key chain when I need it. The memory capacity is great too. Thanks guys!
5	1392768000	I bought this device a five months ago and waited to write a review so to test it out.  I can definitely say that this product is a great buy! I needed a portable USB with a good amount of memory and looked around Amazon and read the reviews for this product and was not disappointed.  It fits great on my keychain and does not have any damage from me carrying my keys around.  It also looks great. Very slim and sleek!The price is a tad bit high but I've bought other USB's in the past that were less expensive but was always let down by the quality and how long it would survive.  I'm glad I invested in this USB and always get inquiries about it from friends. (:
4	1392768000	When my Samsung smart TV decided not to play nice with Plex Media server, I bought this to load up my digital media files and walk them upstairs to plug into the USB slot on the TV. The capacity is great. The price is great. There is no cover, but it spends its life stuck in a USB slot, so who cares? It will take about 1-2min per TV show in HD to transfer from the computer to this stick, which makes me want to sink another hour or two into figuring out why Samsung and Plex are not playing well with each other. The hole in the top makes it easy to pull out of the USB slot, but I do have to use a LED flashlight to see the USB slot on the TV to get the thing to seat well. It is pretty tight in the USB slot.
4	1392681600	This little thing is sturdy, has nice capacity, and looks cooler than most other thumb drives. I take it everywhere with me (on my key chain) and have only one complaint so far. When this thing is reading and writing data it gets pretty hot. I'm no flash storage expert but I'm wondering if that is because of the casing and if that will have an adverse effect on the life of the storage. Other than that there are no complaints.
3	1392681600	I think it was good to make it more professional and comfortable in a way where not only those who work in the company used it but as student as well.
5	1392595200	Small and huge at the same time--like jumbo shrimp! Perfect fit for the keychain. Feels sturdy. The only drawback is no light to indicate that it is mounted or in use (not a big deal for me, but worth pointing out).
5	1392595200	These babies got warm when I blasted them with data, but considering the size I'm extremely satisfied.I've had an issue with hiccups through my car stereo but for now I'll blame this on the head unit.I'd like to have many more of these because of the cost - I'd almost rather have 8gb units instead for ease of use through my single DIN unit, but these are cheaper.  I contacted Siilcon Power (the seller) for other info I was seeking and they are extremely helpful concerning their product (just looking for geek info).
5	1392595200	Works well and the design is nice as well. Happy with the purchase. The item was as described and is USB2.0
1	1392595200	Is very small and nice design and material, but in my case only work 2 weeks, I never expose to water or drops but one day just never work again.
5	1392422400	I love this USB drive, no sliding mechanism to break or cap to lose, just a single piece of metal - so simple!
4	1392336000	This is the kind of product that can't really be critically reviewed unless it is over time.  I'll try to remember to come back in the future and post an update.  I was initially put off by the tiny size of the flash drive -- a little smaller than your average key.  Sort of the size of my mailbox key.  Now it doesn't bother me.  I was also a little put off by the fact that there is nothing enclosing or encapsulating the front of the drive where the little wires are.  Of course, you can't see the wires.  They are way up in there, so, for now at least, this doesn't appear to be a problem.  People have written variously in terms of whether the ring portion of the drive is bent or not.  Yes, it is at a very slight angle that is ever-so-slightly lower than the drive itself.  This makes sense, especially if you accidentally knock the drive, you will notice that the ring portion, which is ever-so-slightly lower will not move, so I personally like this feature.  So far so good.  It records quickly, was a cinch to install, and I absolutely love the fact that I can put it on my key ring with all of my other important keys/items.  Brilliant.  It is supposed to be weather-resistant which is why I paid the extra money for this type.  If it's going to be on a key ring, that's a good thing to have.
5	1392249600	Its everything I want in a flash drive:  cheep, transfers rate is good enough, very small, and it could never fall off your key-chain.Best one I have had yet, use it for school and bought it because all the others eventually fell off my key-chain.
5	1392249600	Great deal and a great look! Small and sleek yet fully functional!  Fast Shipping A+ and with a whopping 16 gigs can not beat the price!
4	1392249600	It worked well, it had just under 15 gigs of space, but it had a slow read time. It works, it looks nice, and doesn't take longer than 4 minutes to move around 2 gigs. So yeah, 4/5 stars.
5	1392249600	Wow-it's tiny!  Nice solid ring if you need it.  I'm going to hook a lanyard onto it just to keep from losing it. I had to reformat to NTFS from its FAT32 to store files bigger than 4GB, but other than that it's good to go right out of the package.
1	1392249600	Mind numbingly slow.  Fails to even load directories at times.  Absolutely the worst usb key I've ever owned.  Transfer is slow, access is slow, eject is slow, everything is a time waster with this product.
1	1392249600	First of all, when this drive worked, I loved it.  Its construction made it easy to hang on my lanyard at work without the fear of it breaking.However, 6 months into using (and having quite a few files on there), it decided to completely stop working while I was in the middle of writing a word document.  I hit &#34;CRTL+S&#34; and the drive said it was no longer available.  I have had the IT guy at work look at it and try to retrieve my documents (at the very least) to no avail.I am devastated that all of my documents and presentations are gone.  Completely disappointed with this product.
5	1392249600	Not much to say. This has worked flawlessly, is very sturdy, and is a great, attractive addition to my keychain.  The metal case is tough and thoroughly protects the electronics.  I expect it to last a long time.
5	1392249600	It gets the job done. It's fast and it looks nice. Real 64.35 GB. It just fits anywhere without losing it because it's too small.
2	1392163200	I previously had the Kingston Data Traveler, (http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Digital-DataTraveler-DTSE9H-16GBZET/dp/B00DYQYITG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1392237215&sr;=8-1&keywords;=keychain+flash+drive) which is similar to this, but eventually just died. I think the actual chip fell out - I don't know if the glue loosened or what.  So I bought the 32gb version of the Silicon Power, hoping that the loop portion would be thinner (it is) and take up less real estate on my keychain (it does).  It seems to have a little hole inside the ring, which I thought might house an LED to show it's working, but it doesn't, or at least the LED on mine doesn't light.  Other than that, it's one piece of smooth aluminum (just like the Kingston), which I like, no slidey parts which always break.Anyway, the downside is this thing is SLOW.  I've never had such a slow USB drive, even compared to freebie schwag 2gb drives from 10 years ago.  Getting read speeds averaging between 7 and 10 MB/s.  I felt like the Kingston was way faster.  So, unless you're buying this only for small files like word documents, I'd stay away from this one, even though the form factor is very nice.  Even jpg files take seconds to move to my desktop, which should be more or less instant transfers.
4	1392163200	Good product. I tried already and data stores fast in a fancy and small device. Easy  to carry. Thank You
5	1392163200	Very small and durable drive that fits onto my key chain. File transfer is pretty fast too. The design is good too.
4	1392163200	After over the month of using I have to say-this is a steal.It very light and feels very durable.I have it on my key chain and no scratches noticed yet.Cons:-not a USB 3.0-there is not protection, so connector gets dirty(if you are caring it in the pocket).Some rubber plug would do the job.
1	1392076800	very small.  it is nothing like what it looks online.  the end is not protected either.  chance of getting debris in them.
5	1392076800	I liked it is very small, I thought it was bigger but is not even the size of my pinky. So it's very nice to have 16 GB in such a small device. Attach it to something real quick, otherwise you may lose it.
3	1392076800	It's a tight fit. It makes this awful scratchy noise when I plug it in, and you really have to force it. It doesn't smoothly glide in like other USBs I've had. But, it's lightweight and you can't lose the cap - 'cause there isn't one.
5	1392076800	Purchased two of these for work use:  one for myself, one for our director.  Device is small and seems quite sturdy.  The fact that it does not have a cap or sliding mechanism, but instead just plugs directly into the USB port, is a definite plus.  The large loop enables it to fit easily on a key chain without getting caught or sitting at an angle with keys and other items on they keychain.  Only concern would be debris or an object getting into the USB opening of it, but the odds of that happening seem low to me.  Would recommend!
4	1392076800	Like the size and convenience. Does get warm during file transfer but not an issue @ this point. Would recommend it to a friend. Speedy shipping.
5	1392076800	Great little flash drive, I'm a stickler for a flash drive on keychains.There when you need it, hidden when you don't.I'm upgrading from my Kingston SE9 which has been great but has been relatively slow and has had trouble being picked up in alot of machines.This flash drive fits very well on my keychain, the large hole allows for you to grasp it and pull safely (without using your fingertips or pulling from the keys) out of the port. It also allows it to lie flat against your keys when used in a keyring (this is absolutely vital as I WANT SLIM keys!)It's relatively quick for a USB2.0, but I will be looking for a replacement USB3.0 for the sake of speed and futureproof.Overall a great little flashdrive, though!
1	1391990400	5 months into the purchase it is not recognized as a hard drive. I used all the downloadable recovery software and tools. Still does not work. Cannot return through Amazon. Going through the process of a replacement seems vague and tedious. I might just buy another more reliable brand name.
5	1391990400	I know it might sound strange, but I already knew it would be a good drive, but what got me was the shape. It is small enough to hide in the key slot in my bag but b/c of the ring shape it is still easy to get out. Love it.
5	1391904000	This is a very durable flash drive, and can be attached to a key chain or a clip with worrying about the drive itself falling off. It has a very nice and sleek design.I recommend this product. Thank you
5	1391904000	I have always attached my flash drives to my keys, which go in and out of my purse and backpack (for school). All of my flash drivers with time had gotten beat up in my purses and backpacks BUT this flash drive is of tough material and has not yet bent or show any cracks.Love the look and the functional aspect of this product! I will definitely continue to purchase this flash drive, again!
2	1391817600	I purchased this drive because I needed something sturdy to use with my Toughbook while on the job.  This drive worked fine for the first two months, then it started having problems.  First it got the "USB drive not recognized" issue, which forced me to reformat.  I lost all of my files and had to go to a backup.  Even after formatting I continually get harrassed by windows to "scan and fix errors". Random files will get corrupted on the drive, and I'm afraid to add more important documents.  It's a shame because this drive seems very sturdy and there are so many great reviews on it.  The speed was not the greatest, but not the slowest I've had either.  I am attempting to deal with them directly for the Lifetime Warranty.
4	1391731200	I love the design, it's a lot smaller than I anticipated. Fits great on my key chain as it is smaller than an average key. I am a little hesitant that there is no cover over the USB connection, but I guess that goes with the design. It feels very stury and it was super fast, I am not doing a formal speed test or anything but it went a lot faster than I anticipated.
5	1391731200	This feels very well built and the benchmarking tools I used verified it's speed. I use portable apps that run 100% off the flash drive so speed and space is important. I can run portable versions off Open Office, Google Chrome, and 3-4 other portable apps without any lag. I also run portable games from it from time to time. I highly recommend this drive!
5	1391731200	A good and simple design - it is a silvery, metallic, but very small and lightweight. And most importantly - no unnecessary and annoying details.
5	1391731200	Small, with no cap to lose. No flimsy lanyard to break. The drive is all metal and appears very rugged.This device does not have built-in encryption. So, if you need to protect your files from prying eyes, you'll need to encrypt your files separately using trucrypt, or similar software.
5	1391644800	Works great. But while lots and lots of similar Flash Drives work just fine, this one also incredibly small. There is no &#34;moving parts&#34; you do not have to pushing connector out of the body before plugging it in and pulling it back in while you disconnect and there in no cover to use like in those where connector made unmovable. The whole device is made as a &#34;connector&#34; one inch long, that's it.Half the length of the typical drive, half the thickness.Actually, it is so small, I did not throw away the chain. This one I can finally put on my keychain - it is half the size of the smallest key I have
5	1391644800	This has not brake from my keys chains. I love the size and the easiness to use. A must buy.
4	1391558400	The USB is a good size. The build is quite solid. Transfer rate is a bit slow IMO, ranging from 11-14 mb/s.
4	1391558400	It is the exact size as advertised with a sleek metal construction but it felt a bit hollow and therefore I missed the heft of a luxury metal product but overall good.
4	1391558400	Had this device for a week now and the functionality is fast and efficient. It comes with backup software which I am experiencing two issues so far. One on win7 LT - when you open the .exe that is initially copied into the drive it resides on and must remain there for use going forward, what is called SP Widget application a visual basic error returns however, it opens each time on this win7 laptop.XP desktop- the .exe file attempts to open and returns error- Widget failed to load.  Anyone who is tech-savvy knows this can be related to the PC and/or current settings so I do not weant to put the entire blame on the application.The brighter side is this is optional software which is a nice thing but you surely can manually copy / backup everything easily, efficiently and plenty of 64GB space.Transfer speeds are not bad- will not bore myself and list speeds, etc. It's just good.Very reasonable price.I would lay out 5 stars but for the software glitch may I offer 4.
5	1391558400	Quick and to the Point: This drive has decent, slightly less-than-average transfer speeds, but seems relatively durable and reliable. Definitely a good deal for $10.Full Review:I purchased this drive to put on a keychain that I use to get into my dorm and my PO box [college student]. I also formatted it so that it would work on both Mac and PC, as I constantly switch between my desktop running Windows and my Macbook. If you find yourself in this situation, a quick google search on &#34;how to format a USB drive for both Windows and Mac&#34; yields several very useful links. For those that already know how to format a drive and, for some reason, are looking for the specific format type, use MS-DOS [FAT].I bought this drive with speed NOT in mind. If I wanted files to transfer faster, I would have invested in a USB 3 drive - my past experience has shown me that there is a direct relationship between the price of the USB drive and it's speed. In plain terms, you get what you pay for.This drive, however, wasn't painfully slow - I was able to transfer/write things at moderate speeds of roughly 10-18 Mbps. It therefore had no problem moving some small MP4 files and word documents [with word documents being the main files that I store on this drive]. I usually let it do its thing while I go to eat or something, so I don't really notice the speeds - sorry.The paint on the key side is starting to scratch a little, but I can't say that I didn't expect it to. I mean, with all the keys on the lanyard and the metal scratching against the paint, it's bound to happen.The drive itself seems pretty sturdy as well. I doubt it would bend much if I accidentally stepped on it [if, for some reason, I were to step on my keys...].
5	1391558400	USB drives. Eh, they either work or they don't. This one works. But better yet, it's compact, and it has a hole large enough to fit one of those cheap carabiner rings that are so common. That's why I got this, and it works great!I did have to reformat it to NTFS so it would take larger files. No big deal.
3	1391558400	I ordered 2 of these.  One of them is entirely unreadable on 3 different computers.  I'm going to have to exchange or return it.  I do like the convenience of it going on a key chain.
4	1391385600	I have a handful of these, and Kingston SE9s. These Silicon Powers are much faster, though none of them is extremely fast. The 8GB is slower than the 64GB, but I don't have other sizes to test. The 64GB runs around 25MB/s (going from memory) The 8GB was more like 10MB/s. I can't speak to the other sizes.
5	1391385600	Smaller than I imagined for some reason.I love having it on my keychain.It is very handy and i am glad I purchased it.16 GB now-a-days is not much, but for the keychain, it'll do.
5	1391385600	This 64 gb flash drive is compact and sturdy and and is easy to handle, which is what I wanted. Great service and fast delivery.
5	1391385600	this was even better than I expected. I use it to store movies and music. I love how it is a keychain, so I never have to look for it, or worry about losing it. it has more than enough space. im very happy with this purchase.
5	1391385600	Got it fast, hard case fits snugg, very fast. I just wish it had a data light. For when data is being transferred thare should be a light BLINKING .
5	1391299200	I had to write this review after this flash drive just survived 1.5h in the washing machine at 40C. All data are still intact. Awesome!It's USB 2.0 so copying of big files takes a bit, but apart from that, great stuff!
4	1391299200	I love this thumb drive, it is sleek and is easy to get on a lanyard or keychain or whatever. Only problem i have found is that it is hard to slide into any usb port. Feels like i'm scratching it up.
4	1391299200	Replacement for a smaller folding flash drive.  Looks classy, unobtrusive, and small compared to keys on the ring.  Would be nice to have a cover for the USB opening to prevent dirt intrusion (not that my jeans pockets are filled with crud).
4	1391212800	Great flash drive. The only thing I wish it had was an indicator light to let me know when it's working.
4	1391126400	This 64GB Flash Drive is just what I was looking for.  I work with a virtual &#34;zoo&#34; of operating systems so this 2.0 drive works well.  The modern design is great BUT the quality control is slightly lacking.  The drive is aluminum so a bur stands out. A metal bur scratched me right out of the box.  I finely found a file and no more bur.  I&#8217;d recommend this product (I&#8217;ve already bought another one) but be careful unpacking.
5	1391126400	This flash drive is exactly what I was looking for. The traditional ones come with a top that I usually tend to lose and the loop that comes with it wears out or even tears. That, however, is not the case with this flash drive. It is very sturdy and goes easily on your key chain. I believe I also read on the package that it was waterproof. No more losing tops or loops tearing, would definitely recommend to anyone.
5	1391040000	Really small (I wish there was a picture with a banana in it to show relative size)everything is standard usb about it, I guess the O-ring could be for a keychain
5	1390953600	This flash drive is extremely durable, good speed, solid materials.  Is a little snug fitting into most USB ports, but I like that because my keys are attached to this at all times so it's nice that it doesn't fall out.
1	1390953600	I am reviewing the 64GB drive that is attaches to your keys.  I do bookeeping for my dad on the side so I like to keep his files on a flash drive that attaches to my keys,  It worked like a charm the first time I plugged it in and I transferred all the files on to it.I was at dad's house late last night to get caught up on his stuff. Worked for about 3 hours. I unplugged from my laptop and went to plug into his desktop so I could print something and no drive recognized. I was in a panic!  I don't have enough time in my life to lose 3 hours!  I drove home hoping it had something to do with his computer and it would be fine once I got to my desktop. Wishful thinking. This drive is DEAD as a door knob basically after 2 uses.  The drive does not show up even in disk management. That means no at home file recovery service is going to work, it has to be able to see the drive.  So now I have to recreate all the work.I think one of the problems could be is the disk part is exposed - so if it's in your purse or whatever it probably leads to issues.  I previously had the SanDisk Cruzer and never had a problem with it working.  The SanDisk has a cover for the disk part (or whatever you call it).  The problem with the SanDisk is that it's plastic. So when I drop my keys (which I often do) the plastic piece that attaches to your key ring breaks. I am going to order another one of those anyway and try not to drop my keys.  In a perfect world they SanDisk Cruzer would be in metal casing, but I've learned there is no perfect world :)SanDisk Cruzer Switch CZ52 32 GB USB Flash Drive (SDCZ52-032G-B35).Of course Amazon is great and will refund. But I would have preferred to get the refund but keep the drive so I could see if my local store could possibly recover the 1 excel file that represents 3 hours of time.  Lesson learned - I should have immediately saved a second copy of that file on the laptop hard drive...l..
5	1390953600	This is a super cool drive!  I was worried that the finish/metal would be a cheap laminate or metallic paint over plastic - not at all! A solid lightweight 32gb drive that is unobtrusive on the keychain, low profile, and fits easily yet firm in numerous USB ports.  Looks perfect in my Macbook Pro, and matches the aluminum unibody perfectly.
5	1390953600	Let's just start with the aesthetic:It's one solid piece of aluminum... not one detectible solder, weld, or split. This shows intentionality and concern for lasting wear.As a result of this, the piece feels incredibly sturdy and useful. The electronics will definitely fail before the design does.Beyond this, it has a lot of other things going for it:It's huge storage at an affordable price. This means that you can keep your files ready to go, A LOT of files, and have portability.Flash memory has a lot going for it, but it is still unstable. This brand boasts a lifetime warranty, which means that if anything goes wrong under normal use, the only thing I'll be crying about is my lost information.Other mentions: This piece fits super tight (almost too tight) with the first couple of plugins. This is to be expected for most USB flash drives, but this one particularly, because there isn't that much play in the solid design. This is okay, though... I think this helps it to be more sturdy and last longer.Overall, this is one of the few brands on the market that still offers a comprehensive and lifetime warranty on their electronics. That, in of itself, should sell the product, but I believe they have gone above and beyond the call by making this piece of technology rock-solid and aesthetically pleasing. I might just buy another one.
4	1390867200	I wasn't concerned with read or write speeds.  Just needed storage and that is exactly what I got.  Would have been better if drive had an LED.
1	1390867200	I was sufficiently satisfied with the product.  However, it has failed after 5 months of light use.  I contacted the maker, since it carries a life time warranty.  Will update review based on Silicon Power's response.
4	1390867200	Ordered the 64gb version and works fine.  My only complaint is that in Windows 7 it shows as 60 gb available space instead of 64 gb.  I guess the 4 gb is non-usable due to partitioning issues.  Maybe someday they will actually print the amount of space you get instead of how they mislead you now.I know it may look weird seeing a &#34;60 gb&#34; flash drive or a &#34;14 gb&#34; flash drive advertised but at least you know ahead of time what you're paying for.
2	1390780800	When I purchased this jump drive I was unaware that a annual chargewould be required to get a driver downloaded on my computer. I havenever needed to add a special driver to access a jump drive before. Nowhere in your information on Amazon is this mentioned. I apologize if Iam misunderstanding, but as of now I can not access this jump drive.You also changed my homepage to open on your order page and I am nothappy about this. I will return this to amazon and if I don't hear back from you withsome pretty good news, my review will not be pretty. Thank you Del Williams
4	1390694400	I love the big ring on this drive.  It travels well and can be clipped on just about anything.  It gets banged around a lot in bags etc.  and has held up quite well.  No complaints.
2	1390608000	I should have paid more for a little better drive. This one is the slowest drive I have ever used.
5	1390608000	Easy use and form. Practical to attach to a key chain so that you never loose it and its appearance is slick.
5	1390608000	This is an awesome looking easy to use flash drive. Anyone can use this product to keep treasured pictures on classy keychain drive.
5	1390521600	This came on time and in good shape. It is easy to use, and I love that I can hook it to my lanyard to use at work.
5	1390521600	I love this drive! It is perfectly sized and shaped! Transfer speed is pretty good! I would not hesitate to buy another one!
5	1390521600	Nice flash drive, great price.  Fits a little snug into port but may loosen over time.  so much smaller than a normal flash drive.  I will probably get another.
5	1390435200	This is perfect for anyone wanting to have quick access to uploading and downloading files in an instant. I keep it on my key chain so it is always with me.
1	1390435200	I copied files onto the drive to transfer them to another computer.  The other computer couldn't find the files or recognize the drive. The flash drive now sits in the bottom of my trash can having died after one use
3	1390435200	I purchased this flash drive to back up some of the data from my Playstation 3, but unfortunately it turned out not to be recognized by that console even after attempts at reformatting the flash drive and seeking help online.  The flash drive itself has an attractive design and it perfect for attaching to a lanyard or a keychain.  It works just fine, and compatibility issues aside, I would recommend it.
5	1390435200	haha, Okay, okay, these things are pretty damn cool (SUPER SMALL) and nice construction.  They are about 1/2 the size of regular usb flash sticks... really tiny and easily lost if you don't hook them onto something.  They fit nicely into my Macbook Air.  The speeds are average, but I knew paying $6-$7 for a flash drive isn't going to warrant me fast speeds.  To get really nice ones it's double the cost, but I just needed to turn these into a OSX Mavericks and WIN7 boot drives so I can do clean installs of WIN7 and OSX Mavericks with them... works fantastic for that.For regular data moving/swapping around they would probably drive me crazy and are to slow I'm sure.  I carry around an actual 256GB SSD for that type of stuff as well as utilizing Dropbox.
1	1390435200	This drive looks very well constructed but after 2 days it will not mount on any OP sys. OSX,WIN7,WIN8 or Linux. Trying to figure out what is going on with it.
5	1390348800	I bought 5 of these to send scanned copies of our family photographs to my children -- 9 albums.  A lot of precious data.  The drive did exactly what it's supposed to do.  Pleasing design.  Nice product.
5	1390348800	I was recommended by my daughter who is a computer consultant to get it. She knows that as a designer I like beautiful objects.Function has a priority of course, in this case I got both. Great memory stick, light weigh can easily fit on a key chain & very pretty.
1	1390348800	I purchased this to use it to play music on my Pioneer car stereo through the USB connection. It worked great for exactly 3 months and then it stopped working. My radio will no longer recognize it and none of my computers will recognize it, not the apple at home nor the windows 7 at work. Disappointing!
1	1390348800	Had it on my keyring. Used it 5 times? 6 times? Twice it appeared &#34;corrupted&#34; and I had to initialize the disk (erasing the contents I needed). Now won't even register on any computer I own. I can't initialize it or read it or anything. It's crap. Get the KINGSTON DIGITAL TRAVELLER. It's much better.
5	1390348800	It's small, seems durable and super cheap. Unique style of a flash drive. you can hook this flash drive on your keychain.
5	1390348800	I needed a smaller size but durable USB flash and i chose this one because it looks like it's made to last. So far, it has lived up to my expectations. Seems actually solid to hold unlike many others which always bust in half after many uses. It's fairly easy to put into my computer/Tv USB panel..slides right in and out...that's what she said
1	1390176000	I purchased 2 of Silcon Power 32GB and both of them my PC can't detect at all within 2 month.I emailed their tech support and they asked me ship to tech support but I have very important files to ship out.And I had to toss into shredder.It is &#34; Plain Junk&#34;
5	1390176000	I was looking for a solid metal flash drive which would not fall of my key ring. This drive has an all metal casing and is the size of all my other keys. It's a great looking thumb drive if you're one of those Apple people who believe tech does not have to look tacky.
1	1390003200	did not function tried several pc none would recognize that it was plugged in sent email to silicon power no response.
4	1390003200	Works phenomenally in everything except Xerox-branded copiers.  :shrug:  Unfortunately for me, that's 25% of what I need it for..  but if that's not an issue for you, it should be great.
5	1390003200	This is a really nice design and is easily worn as a dog tag. It's also pretty small in size and looks cool in a macbook air.I just wish they had one USB 3.0 with larger capacity. A way to cap its holes would have been nice to to make it water-splash proof.
5	1390003200	I received it on time and it works perfectly a must have USB and with that price its the best you can get seriously people.
4	1389916800	Product comes with some preloaded fluff, but since I was using this to create a recovery image for Windows it was all deleted anyways.Cool looking USB stick. Nice and small too.
5	1389830400	Solid metal with big loop.  Small and compact.  The only thing you might miss is an activity light, but it seems many flash drives are coming without one.
1	1389744000	I used this Flash drive maybe a total of 10 times before it stopped responding.One moment it was working, identified by my MacbookPro as usual. A few moments later, after removal an reinsertion, it was not. There were no extenuating circumstances, just normal use.Additionally, the data transfer rate was abysmal. I expected much faster rates. The stick died before I ran proper benchmarks.Maybe a fluke, but given both shortcomings I won't be buying again.Sure does look sexy though, wish I could have one that was reliable.
5	1389744000	This works so well, I'm sorry I didn't get the 64GB model.  That being said, I moved all of my photos (20 years worth) onto it in order to consolidate them all in one place and it took up less than half of the space on the device.
5	1389744000	Do not regret buying. Would get another one if i ever run out of space, but 16gb is good enough
5	1389657600	I purchased a few of these to use for demos.  I have install 5 or 6 operating systems on them and I use them to boot into in order to allow my clients to experience the capabilities and functionality of a new operating system without having to format a drive or commit site unseen.  This thing allows me to put a large amount of data into a small device and take it anywhere.The circular handle makes it very easy to remove when needed and the aluminum construction gives it a very nice appearance and feel.
5	1389657600	Really neat design.  Bought it for my GF, but should have gotten it for myself!  This will be the next one I buy for myself.
5	1389657600	Didn't have to be configured to work with Mac and works with Samsung tv.  Great product, no problems at this point.
5	1389657600	Not bulky and lots of space. Can hold loads of pictures and other files. Fits snug. Easy to put on key chain.
5	1389571200	A beautiful flash drive with an elegant design. It's smaller than it looks in picture. It's easy to use especially because of the cap-less design (I find it annoying to have caps or anything else that you have to do to cover the connector).
5	1389571200	It is a little tight on some ports but other than that, it's a great tool to carry around. Flash drives are a necessary tool to carry for most everyone these days, and it has to be at hand when you least expect needing one.  It's like personal &#34;jumper cables&#34;.
4	1389571200	I am vey happy with my purchase and thus it gets 4 stars. If it were cheaper, then it would have been awarded 5 stars. But Ithink it is a solid bit of tech.
1	1389571200	I used this mainly for transferring files not as much as storage.  But in the month and a half I have used it, I've lost numerous files on a repeated basis because my Mac couldn't read it.  I have had to reformat it 4-5 times so that it would work.  It's frustrating!  It's now sitting in a box ready for UPS to pick it up.
5	1389484800	Bought this to carry on my keychain because I tend to loose my flash drives.  While not as small as some others, this one is tapered at the top and is pretty thin.  I paid a slight premium for this form factor.  I've used it for several months and found it to work very well and would recommend it if folks want this form factor - there are less expensive options and smaller options but I was aware of that when I bought it.
1	1389484800	bought the 64 gb it ceased working two months after purchase , lost all my files , almost cost me a contract , bottom-line worst purchase ever !!!!!!!
5	1389398400	I can't say enough about this dongle, so I'll just be brief.  Small.  Sturdy.  Well-designed. 32 gig.  Perfect for work, home or both.
5	1389398400	Fairly quick read and write. Very small form factor. No issues putting it on my key chain.I would buy again.
5	1389312000	OK this is a thumb drive, and it works fine, as it should. Five stars because it is cool for 2 reasons:1) it is rigid, No wiggling around, it fits snugly and does not feel like your timex watch could crush it in a grudge match.2) has a loop, good for tugging the little bugger out of its super-snug fit in the USB port, else you'd never get the darn thing out 'cause it is a bit slippery, and there is no other undulation upon which to grip it. In fact I suggest adding a keychain loop to it for extra grip. Or for hanging from a hook, or, even, your keychain, though people who hand their USB drivers from their keychains are inviting derision.
5	1389312000	This was the best price / storage / form-factor / speed for my Raspberry Pi XMBC deployment.  So far, so good and I will update the review if anything good or bad happens.
1	1389312000	After only a week of use, the driver just disappeared and I lost all my data.  I was under pressure for a deadline and tried to look for the driver to download.  Ended up wasting too much time as you can't find it anywhere.  I really wanted this flash drive to work as it's convenient to keep on a key chain and is sleek. Was a horrible purchase.
3	1389225600	Well first off the usable amount is 14.5gb only, I bought two and both are the same. I understand it won't be the full amount of 16gb but it should be more then 14.5gb. Second off the write speed is horrible, it took around 7minutes to write a little over 1gb onto it.The plus side is the construction of the usb, and this is key. The construction of it is very durable and you can put it on your key chain. I would suggest this for a student and such but for backing up files (everyday) for a game I am developing is kind of useless for me since its slow and comes with only 14.5gb per each one.
5	1389225600	I have been using this product for a few months now and it is always on my key chain.it is very reliable and the color did not wear off at all.
5	1389225600	Much better quality casing than the Corsair 64GB USB 3.0 Flash Voyager Mini (CMFMINI3-64GB) which I also bought at the same time.
2	1389139200	The Silicon Power 16GB T03 USB 2.0 stick I received today from Amazon is being returned as defective for in the past 90 minutes have gotten three "Scan and Fix" messages from Win7 Ult64 upon insertion of the USB stick. The errors occurring with both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports. Two of the errors taking place with the device formated as FAT32, the last error while using NTFS. (see photos)The Silicon Power 16GB T03 USB stick shows up in Windows Properties as 15.589 GB (14.5 formated) rather than 16 GB, and short by over 400 MB. Meeting one's own advertised memory space value to within 20 MB or less not being an issue with other memory devices I have from Kingston, ADATA, Verbatim, Patriot, Transcend, ...Drive volume name limited to 10, automatically capitalized letters.After slow formatting using FAT32, the Silicon Power 16GB T03 USB memory stick was recognized by Windows ReadyBoost as just a 4 GB device.
3	1389139200	For whatever reason only 10GB of storage is available on the USB. Works well though. Fits in the USB port firmly.
3	1389139200	Greatusb memory stick.  Just wish the read speed was faster.  The write is fast enough, but read is a little slow
3	1389139200	Would be nice if you were able to format the drive into NTFS rather than FAT32, causes problems for you if your file is over 4GB
5	1389139200	Love the large (but thin) ring, so I can easily put it on my key chain like a key.  Love that 64gb for the price so I can store a good amount of data in one place and have capacity for carrying a lot more!  Loe the aluminum body and it is holding up well in my pocket on a key chain in a military uniform in a combat zone.
1	1389139200	The SP Firma 16GB USB flash drive is pretty and practical... while it works.Once it stopped working (after about a month and a half it stopped being recognized by either macs or PCs) it remained pretty but was no longer very practical.
5	1389052800	Love the product...., but it would be nice if there was a removable (rubber) cap to cover the open end of the drive.
5	1389052800	I love these drives, you can place on key chains or keep in the smallest pouches for travel and in all my work have never had a failure to function at the highest level.  I would warn you to be aware that these are so compact and efficient that they can be misplaced or lost easily and they may contain a lot of important data so plan to use them with proper safeguards as to where you keep them.
2	1389052800	I purchased the SP 32GB flash drive to use to store music files I play in my car. I didn't copy my files to it until the Christmas holidays and I started using it in my car a week ago. It played fine but yesterday it suddenly started showing message 'Unsupported'. I connected it to my computer and it says it cannot find the device driver. I tried going online to get a new driver but the driver manager on Silicon power site is not installing on my computer running Windows 7. I was really looking forward to having good music in my car and this failing has dampened my spirit.
5	1389052800	Thin, light, perfect keychain addition for easy storage of data. Durable and ready to use in a moment. Metal protects from damage.
5	1389052800	I love this thing, it is small and I hardly ever notice it on my keyring, so much so that I occasionally forget that I have a flash drive with me when I need one.
5	1388966400	The perfect little flash drive. This device is a pleasure to use on both my laptop and desktop. I frequently move files between the two computers and my 32GB Firma flash drive is up to the task. I like its design...it is easy to remove and it can be put on a keychain for ready access. Best little thumb drive I've ever bought! Highly recommend it.
1	1388966400	the music skips in my stereo then it took a crap after 3 weeks! dont buy not shock proof or waterproof!
5	1388966400	This is my favorite USB drive I've ever had. It's really small, but not so small that it disappears. It also feels substantial, unlike a lot of others. This thing doesn't feel like it's going to break. No moving parts, no cheap plastic loop that's going to break and leave your valuable data on the street. It's sitting securely on my keychain, added almost no bulk, and looks beautiful. The speeds are what you would expect. Not great, but I think there is a USB 3 version available. I'll be buying that in the future when I can warrant it. Highly recommended.
5	1388880000	Love the size of storage plus the fact that fits perfectly well in my device. I got witching two days. TotallySatisfied.
4	1388707200	Really small & lightweight for this much capacity, appealing design.  I plan on using it primarily to watch stored videos on my HDTV through a small set-top box.  So far, works great with absolutely no problems.  Other reviews stated that it has a good read speed, and it seems to stream 720p video with no hiccups.  Does get warm, but doesn't seem to affect performance at all.
2	1388707200	Real slow write speeds pretty but not what I expected, I expected the device to be quicker than my 5 year old flash drive, stupid me
5	1388707200	These are reliable drives.  Low profile, nearly indestructible. Ok, I haven't really taken a hammer to them or anything, but i have had several of the &#34;plastic sleeve&#34; flash drives that have come apart with normal use. these are a great design. Solid, not flexible. The ring is big enough to grasp easily for pulling out the drive. For data archive and/or mailing large files these are great.
5	1388707200	I have been looking for a usb drive to have on my classroom key ring that was more durable that the usual plastic versions on the market and would move easily on the key ring. This perfect,  it is physically smaller than I thought but that is not a bad thing. I hope it stands up to daily use.
5	1388707200	This high capacity USB flash drive is uber convenient with the key ring built right in.  Always right at hand.
5	1388620800	This USB drive is much smaller than it looks in the picture, which just adds to the wow factor.  I've been impressed so far with speed, portability, and I love the fact that the casing is metal.  This means that it won't break off of my key ring, like the other plastic usb sticks have done.You won't be disappointed!!
5	1388620800	I bought the 64GB version. It did not suit my needs right out of the package. This is formatted exFat which does not allow files over 4GB. I wanted to use this for full back ups of my laptop and desktop PCs. With the 4GB limitation, this was not possible. I reformatted the drive NTFS and it worked flawlessly. I got transfer rates of 5MBs/second for large files and just over 5MBs/second for files smaller than 4GB. I'm extremely satisfied with it. I saw reviews about this getting hot and how the case is not as durable as it seems. I put this drive on a keyring that has about 15 keys on it. It doesn't even have a scratch after 3 days of running in and out the house. The drive does get warm but it's barely noticeable. It does not get as hot as others have written. I guess only time will tell. I will be using this about twice a month. I'll edit this review if I have any problems.I like these so much, I came back and bought 2 more! These work great! Now I can carry most of my music and files everywhere I go! Keep up the great work!
5	1388620800	I received on time. High quality product. And very handy. easy to use. I love it. pleasure to do business with you
5	1388534400	I can transfer 8BG in 3-4 min.  I can get 70 Movies on this (each movie is about 700MB vice DVD size of 4.5GB.  Love the Big ring on the end.
2	1388534400	For some reason, this Flash Drive does not work in my car.  It also fits very tight on all USB ports.  All other drives works fine, so I'll have to assume that the problem is with this drive.
5	1388534400	Great item!  Just the right size.  Fits perfectly on my keychain so I don't misplace it.  I would definitely recommend it.
5	1388534400	good design and really small, can put it in my wallet. looks more solid than plastic flash drive, overall is great
5	1388361600	Love this flash drive. I bought this because I keep breaking the plastic one that are not all one piece. Fits nicely on my keychain. Don't have to mess with it opening up like the ones that fold up.
5	1388361600	I bought several of these and gave them to my coworkers. We use them to boot computers with Hirens for ghost imaging. We all love the design and so far we've had no failures.
5	1388361600	I have a couple of dozen of these thumb drives knocking around in my backpack, but these are something special: durable, well designed and capacious, as well as affordable. It does not get any better than that. I have one with my whole library on it!
5	1388361600	Very, very nice looking little flash drive. The ring is perfect for keeping it on my keychain. Great value.USB 3.0 would have been nice, but it's not a huge deal.
5	1388361600	Compact, sleek. I love the metal casing and finish. No cap to lose. Great price for the capacity as well. I will most likely buy another one. Very good deal!
5	1388275200	Works great.  Its very small and the hole makes it easy to remove.  It looks pretty cool too.  I would buy another.
4	1388275200	When I saw this little beauty, and that it was reasonably priced, I purchased it.  I like the fact that it is an alloy and not plastic.  One very slight down side, is that it fits very tight in the USB port.  8GB is nothing to rave about, but still useful and provides ample storage for my text docs and a few pics.
5	1388275200	Durable and a perfect design.  Always gets other people's attention.  Reliable too.  No problems and always works.  You will love the way it feels and looks.
5	1388275200	This is very handy for when I need to transfer a file, etc.  I keep it on my keychain.  Durable and convenient.  Good stuff.
5	1388275200	The gb size should be engraved in the metal and the price can come down some more :). Other that that it's perfect.Now they need to work on raising the amount of gb's without the price increase.  NOW WERE TALKING...
5	1388188800	I read product reviews on Amazon before making a purchase, and the one I read about this flash drive &#34;sold&#34; me.  The reviewer said he uses it as a music player in his car's USB port.  That's exactly what I use this for, and it works very well.  I'm not a technical wizard; I'm sure there are more expensive, better flash drives available.  This one was inexpensive, fits on my key ring, and holds more music than I loaded on it.  I like its design...and an unexpected plus is that the &#34;look&#34; of this flash drive blends in with the console of the car, so I don't notice it at all (unlike my old flash drive, which was quite a bit larger, and red plastic).  I've only had this for a short time, but I use it almost every day in my car.  So far, so good!
2	1388188800	Everything good at the beginning but before a month it stopped showing on every computer.  No way to use it or reformat it.  I'm going back to LaCie flash keys again.
5	1388188800	Serious, fast and secure! Brand new! I`m completely happy with my product. No problems at all. Thank you very much.
5	1388102400	Seems like a great drive. Very solid (all metal) case. Drive is tiny! It's incredible that this much storage can fit on a keychain. Can't beat it for the price.
5	1388102400	I am hard to please but I must say this is a well made product that centers around a good design (a key point). I like it so much that I bought two more to use as backups on our other key rings. Don't waste time researching and trying to find better thumb drives out there. You are looking at it. I especially like these features: 1. durable exterior case, 2. size of exterior case - fits well on a key ring, 3. no exposed usb connection (very important) - it's all internal, 4. price per GB is totally fair and 5. no moving parts. I don't think they could make it any better besides maybe offering customers other metal colors such as a bright red or some other color to signify the drive is for backup or important files. Furthermore, a bright color would make the drive stand out if left on a desk with many other things around it. (And no, I don't work for the company or was paid to write this review. I just believe in this good product.)
5	1388102400	This is the FIRST usb thumb drive i've been able to attach to my keychain and not have it be bothersome. All of the other options are either too bulky, or too small... yes too small. This one has a large slim opening at the top which makes it dangle very nicely on a keychain and fall right in line with my other keys.
5	1388102400	Was as expected. Fits nicely on my keyring. Ordered a few more so I'd be able to give them out as gifts.
5	1388016000	Stop thinking and click buy, I thought for awhile and am so glad I just purchased it!!!! Works very well...
5	1388016000	Looks nice, feels sturdy, works great, although not the fastest transfer speeds in the world, but then again I didn't pay the price you must to get more speed.
1	1387929600	I bought the 64 GB version.  It didn't work so I tried to use Silicon Power's live chat.  Even though I was trying to use it during the hours that were listed there was never anybody on line.  So I emailed Silicon Power.  Without even asking what was wrong with my unit they replied (I have pasted their response without editing) &#34;Customer service would kindly suggest you that please try to contact the original purchasing store to make sure if they could help you to replace the product first&#34;.  So in a nut shell the unit didn't work and the customer service didn't either.
3	1387929600	I love the design of this but the access times are noticeably slower than my other usb flash drives.  Still its not bad.
4	1387929600	Its different, I like it! Haven't start to use it but it was delivered quickely. So am excited to use it.
5	1387929600	Works perfect for me. Totally satisfy with product. Exactly what I was looking for. Recommend to all my friends and family.
5	1387843200	Happy to finally find a perfect size and perfect ergonomic in on flash drive... have been using the large plastic housing knowing I was carrying far too much plastic... have been using some extremely tiny ones, but it was hard to insert and remove from the computers... this one is perfect... thanks Silicon Power.
5	1387843200	Outstanding!  I was worried about durability when I bought this, but this thumb drive  can stand up to anything.  It is a light metal alloy and has survived about a year of hard use.  I keep it on my keychain and the snug USB fit keeps it firmly in place.  Great storage capacity.  I've got a ton of documents, pics, and music and works like a dream.
5	1387843200	I finally found a flash drive my brother can't lose or destroy. When I gave him a very small 32 G I thought it would be convenient for him to transfer files to his home computer. When he gave be back the cap with out the rest of the drive I learned an expensive lesson. This one is on his key ring and we both know where to find.
5	1387843200	The aluminum flash drive is perfect as a keychain accessory for me. I do a lot of conventions and business trips and I've had occasions where someone wanted to give me several big files and I had to run around looking for spare flash drives to borrow. Not anymore! The aluminum construction of Silicon Power 64GB Firma flash drive is very sturdy. After spending couple weeks in my pocket with my 5-pound-worth keys and keychains, it still looks like new. The 64 GB capacity is very ideal for Photoshop and AutoCAD files. In fact, I'm storing some of my own project files there just in case I wanted to share with customers. The data transfer speed of the drive is not the fastest but it gets the job done. Now if Silicon Power would come up with the same quality and sturdy construction using USB 3.0, I know what I'm going to get immediately.
5	1387756800	This USB drive is very small and compact on my keys.  It barely weighs anything, and provides plenty of storage on the go.  I've only had it for a couple weeks, but I love how sturdy it feels, and the fact that it's capless.
5	1387756800	While it has quite average write speed this drive is amazingly durable.  i carry it on my keychain at college with me at all times.  the keys don't seem to scratch the device and i've never worried that the loop might brake.  it has a very solid feel to it and i've never had connection issues with it.  This is my favorite flash drive i've ever used and would definitely recommend.  people even compliment the thing.
3	1387756800	It gets very very hot, not sure if that is a good thing...The build quality is good and the speed is great.
1	1387670400	Registered hoping for a warranty if this happened, but support is terrible and I cannot seem to get a replacement.  This was lightly used and is now completely dead.
5	1387584000	This is a great USB key and has proven very durable on a keyring.I will say it is not quite as fast on transfer speed as a few of the keys that I have.It isn't slow though, just about average.  Price to size is good with these and I have no problem saying buy it!
5	1387497600	This item was exactly as described and arrived rapidly. It's small, but can be attached to something by the loop on the end if, like me, you frequently lose things and have something to store that you really don't want lost.
5	1387497600	It might not be as fast as other flash drives, but it is a great size and very durable. Love it.
5	1387497600	I have had this for awhile now and after going through 2 of another brand that was similar (it had the chip call out and get lost)This is far superior to the previous model i had it has been toss slammed and soaked and keeps going the finish has worn down a bit from abuse but it just dont stop working and if it does ill buy another it has more then earned itself some respect from me..
5	1387411200	i haven't tested whether or not it's waterproof, but i don't plan on dropping my xbox into the tub anytime soonit comes preset to fat 32 which worked fine for my xboxfor a 7 gig transfer from my xbox to the sp 32 g, it took maybe between 7-10 minutesi think that's about below what the average transfer speed was listed as, but i am using the first gen xbox 360 as my deviceall in all, this thing is worth well the $20 bucks, that is if you can still get it for thati know a friend on live who payed 60 for one of the same sizei'd like to buy another in fact  if only i had 20 dollars to throw at amazonoh well, this will be sufficient for now and hopefully by the time i need more memory i can still get a decent deal
1	1387411200	I want to like this USB drive. It looks and feels like a quality product. However, I was moving over some 164,000+ files off another smaller drive that I wanted to re-purpose.  The move process lasted well into the night (fell asleep). When I checked the progress the next morning, I still had files on the smaller drive.  Hmm.  Windows and Linux are unable to format the drive, because it is write protected. I cannot delete files because it is write protected. I will NOT be sending this drive in for replacement, because it has my files on it. Silicon power has a utility that is supposed to 'reset' the device to factory condition, but it cannot find the drive to reset it.My first and last purchase of a SP USB device.
1	1387411200	I had this device just over two month and used it only a few times, I would say no more than 3 hours total. It looks great with a middle range performance. But it just completely died. I have had no less than 20 USB flash drivers in the last few years. Never had one died on me. I guess I should've never bought anything just for its looks. It is not recommended to anyone.
1	1387324800	This flash drive came apart after 2 months of use. I had in on my key chain with my car and house keys and one day I came to work, plugged it in and realized that inside of my drive is missing and all I have is an empty shell. I freaked out that all my files, passwords and precious info went missing. I went crawling around my office searching for it. Thank god I found it! But that was way too close. I do not recommend investing in this.
5	1387238400	I bought the 32GB aluminum model. Nice small form factor and solid metal construction. Fits beautifully on my keychain and doesn't seem the least bit bulky or fragile. Surprisingly fast for a USB 2,0 device of this capacity, especially considering the low price compared to other &#34;fast&#34; drives. It claims it's waterproof, although I haven't tested that theory and am not sure I would want to. It doesn't seem to be watertight sealed to me, though it's supposedly backed by a limited lifetime warranty, so if water fries it and they claim it's waterproof, perhaps they'd honor the warranty by replacing it.I use this to multiboot a lot of PC utilities and OS installers via Yumi, and to carry around several gigs of tools, software, and documents, as well as my password manager. It's incredibly convenient to have on a keychain.The price was so good and I was so impressed by the one I bought for myself, that I bought 4 more as Christmas gifts for my friends and roommates. I know they'll love them.If I had only one thing I wish they'd improve on, it's the USB speed. I would love one of these in USB 3.0, and would happily pay 50%-60% more for the extra throughput of USB3 on a device of this capacity.
4	1387238400	It is a nice little thumb drive. I keep it on my key chain and so far it is doing great.
5	1387238400	Seems silly.... but the large key ring hole really helps manage your key ring while have the drive plugged in.......NICE. Metal outside case feels really sturdy.
5	1387238400	it was smaller than i thought it would be but its great for all my classes. i have it on my keys so it comes with me everywhere, it's great.
5	1387152000	It's fast, it's convenient, it unloads from the os immediately. I keep it on a keychain. I love it so far.
3	1387152000	was a pain in the posterior region to order, only could order 5 and i needed 7not very condusive to a positive rating.
5	1387152000	Fits nicely on my keychain and does a good job of making all my key files easily available when I travel.
5	1387065600	Small, durable, stylish, keychain flash drive.  Check out the dimensions, It's really small!  Shipped as described.  I thought it died on me, but I rebooted the computer & everything was fine
5	1386979200	the only thing that could be better is usb 3 but it works great and convent, having it on the key chain makes it hard to leave at a customers site
5	1386979200	I am very satisfied with this product; it is as advertised. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an item like this. The purchase was a smooth transaction and delivery.
4	1386979200	Nice small USB drive, but none of their software will recognize their own drive. I can copy files and stuff to it just fine, but when trying to install some software off silicon power's website, it would not recognize the drive. Otherwise its a pretty solid jump drive.
5	1386892800	I've gone through at least 4 or 5 other usb drives that were attached to my keys, no more. This is perfect, the loop is built in to the unit it's all 1 solid piece of metal, there's no metal clamp loops to break off or strings to snap it's rock solid. Transfer speeds are fast, not amazing, but faster than most other usb drives, and it reads on any device I've put it in.  There is a little hold a the base of the circular ring which has an LED light for indicating that the drive is writing data, it's not pictured but it's there.
4	1386806400	I'd give it 5 stars, except for the fact that it fits really tight in the USB port of my PC at work. It fits so tight that I worry I might break it when I'm trying to push it in. It does fit my Mac USB ports perfectly. I've never had an issue with a flash drive that didn't fit them equally until now. That being said, there doesn't seem to be a functionality problem. It swaps between my Mac and PCs fine with only a slight hesitation opening each time I swap to my PC. Not bad, and has great capacity. I absolutely love the finger-hole design, especially when pulling from the tighter fit of my PC's USB port.
5	1386806400	This is actually the second one I got because I love it so much (and I transfer information quite often).It's small, (VERY) durable, sleek (sooo good looking) and very competitively priced!It supposedly is waterproof but I have yet to test it out.I own other Silicon Power items and am very impressed with the quality.
5	1386806400	Like the simplicity and cool design. That's why I bought it. Other then that - it is a flash drive. What to be amazed about? Works as intended to. Note that in some sockets it goes not as easy as regular USB connectors. Not sure why.
5	1386806400	Awesome durability, speed, and cost. It's standing up better to my keychain than my previous two (2) different Lacie imakey's (which delaminated & 'memory' piece fell out!)
4	1386720000	Bought this to record TV shows. So far it has worked just fine recording from the converter box. Had it only a week so far.
5	1386720000	Finally! A jump drive that will stay on my key ring and not break. The design is great. The price is too.
4	1386720000	Love the form factor, but it's a bit tight fitting in the USB sockets.  Also could stand to be a USB 3.0, although as with most flash drives like this, write speed is a bit slow
1	1386720000	Stopped working after a week. The data transfer was very, very slow at about 1GB per hour of transfer speed.
5	1386720000	Probably the best thumb drive I have ever owned. Works great, looks great, and is small enough to fit just about anywhere. Highly suggest.
4	1386633600	I bought this for my teenager who has either broken or lost three others in the past four months. My hope was that this would not crack/ bend out of the case. It has held up so far, even when he left it in the rain on the porch for three days. My only fear is that because it is so small/ thin, he will lose it. But, other than the porch incident, it has remained with him.
1	1386547200	My ipod stopped working and I decided to buy this as a cheap alternative until I replace it so that I can listen to music in my car.  The problem is the flash drive doesn't work in my car for some reason.  I get a werid message on my radio something about a USB Error.  It's odd sometimes the music doesn't play at all and other times the music starts to play and then stops after about 10 seconds.  I've used other flash drives in my car with no problems.
2	1386460800	I bought this on the 3rd decemeber 2013 stopped working on 8th.It seemed good when it worked i have had small metal usb drive before and it got so hot i couldnt hold it so i left this one plugged in for 2 working days and it didnt get hot i put it on key ring, tried it today and nothing. I download the recovery tool from silicon power but it couldnt see the drive. I'm returning to amazon i had high hopes for this one especially when it didnt get hot.
5	1386460800	I've always been nervous about my usb drive falling off my keychain as it had a cheap wire holding it on. This feels much more secure but isn't bulky.
4	1386374400	Very sleek design with a lot of memory for an excellent price. It isn't much of a problem for me, but it says that the flash drive has 32GB of storage. The flash drive has no pre-installed software, yet it only has slightly over 29GB. (Hence the minus one star) Still an excellent product nevertheless.
5	1386374400	This is just awesome. I put it on my key set and no one realized its a flash drive and it has so much storage!
3	1386288000	Awesome and tiny!  The only gripe is that this is just a little slower than I wanted, but it functions for what I use it for.
5	1386201600	This is the best USB drive I have had. Small. Tough. Stays on my keychain.  Great product. No complaints from me!
5	1386201600	Love the metallic finish. It is now hanging with my keys and loyalty cards in a key ring and is perfect for my traveling job, as it is with me all the time. The 16gb space is great for the price you pay and the beautiful design is a plus!
4	1386201600	Form factor is fun. Well finished, does not looks cheapbut transfers rates are slow. For that price it's ok
5	1386115200	Really good item.  I'm going to buy more for back up.  A monocoque design and construction looks cool but highly functional.  I clipped it to a yellow lanyard, however, to keep from misplacing it.  The capacity is large enough to hold a few movies and tons of uncompressed music.  A good buy overall.
5	1386115200	Product came in on time and performed according to specs.  I am happy with this product.  I would recommend the product to other and found it easy to use.
3	1386115200	This USB drive is slow to write but faster to read from. It serves its purpose. I guess it is OK.
5	1386028800	It hangs right on my True Utility key ring and works great. It looks good and is a good value.
5	1386028800	Love it, small, sturdy, resistant, cool looking, etc, etc. Great buy. I will recommend to my friends for sure. Puppies.
5	1385942400	Really solid flash drive. At first, I was concerned by the design, as it seemed small and possibly flimsy, but the build is superb. The aluminum is light but strong, and the form factor is a huge plus. I haven't had any issues with speed, but then again, I haven't really paid attention while transferring files. The keychain design is a huge plus, and I always have it with my keys.The only con is that it sometimes gets really warm, when either transferring files or if it's directly in the exhaust of my laptop fan. Because it's all metal, it gets hotter much faster than other plastic flash drives.But other than that, perfect device.
5	1385942400	This is by far the smallest, simplest, and most elegant flash drive that I have used. I keep it on my keychain and it is always with me when I need it. I have never worried about it breaking or about the USB connection becoming bent or deformed even though it has no cover or cap. I highly recommend this flash drive.
5	1385856000	Works great.  It is very small, but seems to be holding up nicely on my keychain.This would be better with usb 3.0, but then it wouldn't be this cheap.
5	1385856000	This unit is so neat aesthetically, I love it. Easy to travel with, sturdy metal construction, and very easy to label with a labeling machine (as I do with my &#34;sticks&#34; that look alike). I use the sticks to record movies for travel instead of packing the disks--so convenient. Also, I backup my personal Quicken and business Quickbooks files on sticks giving me greater confidence about having  a backup in addition to my hard drive files. This company shipped quickly and has offered great customer service communication. I'll be making more purchases from them in the future!
5	1385856000	Sweet little device. It takes up less room on my keychain than a key does. I'm using them to back up / archive important things
5	1385769600	this is a very nice little flash drive, more rugged than most and great for keeping on a key chain.  amount of storage is great for the price however transfer speeds are not that great, I'm getting around 8mps read and write with this drive.
4	1385769600	Awesome..however like all usb flash drives it has different speeds on different computers. So if it is slow on your machine doesn't necessarily mean it is slow on others. Just like all usb flash drives it will slow down with large files, the larger the file the slower it will write or read due to the on board memory. Reading is a little faster, i was able to copy a 22gig file from the usb to my computer under 25 minutes. With a 22 gig file it was reading on average around 18-20 mb/second. Writing large files averaged around 4.5 to 10.
1	1385769600	Worked fine for a few weeks. Warning: GETS VERY HOT. Main bone of contention: I just lost my entire drive for the second time. Tried to run a disk recovery application on it (when I saw that the name had switched to a random set of characters when plugged in) but unfortunately everything is gone. 16.09GB of 16.09GB free. Don't waste your money. The transfer rate is also incredibly slow.
4	1385683200	Nice slim sleek and Durable! dust down right all i Could ask for and USB 3.0 would obviously be nice but most pc out there or current mainsteam pc's problably wont have a usb 3.0 port. and on the front packaging and stuff it said waterproof.....i wont test this out but i rely on what it says so if i ever get the usb wet ill just see wheather if its waterproof or not but not planning to because if you plug in a usb that is wet into a pc i think you would screw up varous things but either or, nice usb overall.
5	1385596800	perfect and tough....goes on key ring and is not cheap plastic. Holds thousands of songs and we use in our car with no issue
5	1385510400	I love that the design is modern and convenient, and it being so tiny I'm glad that i can easily attach a string to keep from losing it. Great product!
5	1385510400	Keep these on my keys and it is great.  Don't have to worry about it getting damaged or wet.  Excellent for a college student.
5	1385510400	This is the *only* memory stick I've ever owned that was really engineered to be on a keychain. It's very strong, small, and durable--supposedly, it's waterproof too, though I don't intend to test it!
5	1385510400	the product was fit as expected, good deal, nice option, full recomended, have a good day, thank you verry much.
1	1385510400	It doesn't fit to USB port. Maybe I got defective one. That's it. I have no idea about product quility.
5	1385510400	Great size, great price, and very durable.  I love the aluminium casing, it has a nice fresh and simple design.
5	1385424000	I tend to keep a multi-tool on my key chain along with a miniature flash light and with my latest purchase I now have an incredibly tough and large in storage capacity flash drive. I couldn't have gotten any luckier with such an incredible pick for a compact drive. Next I'll need a screen replacement for my Samsung Galaxy S3 but I'd rather install a PAC-Man Rom first. I feel less bad if I temporarily kill it again that way. All in all, Silicon Power, keep supplying us true nerds with great priced, high quality tech toys. Thank you guys and gals.-Sailon
3	1385337600	Very convenient, not having any moving parts. Nice finish.  Just stick it in, then wait for the computer to see it.  You'll want to transfer files to your main drive though. If you work from this flash drive you'll become quickly frustrated at how slow it is.  Reeallly slow!
5	1385337600	Sturday and fast, easy to attach.  I loved my 32 GB one so much, I bought this one as well.
5	1385337600	It's what and how I expect it to be!  very practical.  I love that I can put it in my keyring and just carry it everywhere.  And the shipping was fast!  I love it!
5	1385251200	The Silicon Power 16GB Firma ZN F80 USB 2.0 Flash Drive, I would have to say is the best one I got.  Love the design because of the circle being able to pull it out easily with these nimble fingers!  The other flash drives I have a hard time with!  I would definitely buy this if I need anymore!!!  Excellent design!!!  Kimberly
5	1385251200	I purchased this drive to replace my 16 GB Silicon Power drive that has been the best flash drive I have found.  The 16 GB drive has been on my keychain and used constantly for over 2 years with ZERO problems.  It has survived 2 trips through the washer and dryer!!  I needed a larger capacity drive, and really like the design of this model. After I received it, I found out it has a LIFETIME warranty.  Obviously, the manufacturer has confidence, and so do I.
5	1385078400	Very cool little flash drive.  Works just like normal, but it is much smaller than I thought it would be.It is totally metal and is pretty tough.  It really has to be for it going on a keychain with keys banging into it.So far so good, works great and is very solid.
5	1385078400	Very nice item. I bought three of them so far. It fits in my key chain perfectly. Never had any problem with so far for 5 months. once they have a USB 3.0 and higher capacity like 128GB i will go for it (if the same design)
5	1384992000	Smaller than I expected. Lighter than I expected. Worked on 2 PC machines without any fuss. Overall, I recommend this.
4	1384992000	It's small, yet easy to plug it in and take it out from any usb, Very sturdy design and really convenient shape if you want to add it in your key chain. At least mine gets a bit hot and the writing timing is very slow.
5	1384819200	This flash drive is very light and very tough. I drop my keys frequently and they sometimes even get stepped on, but this thing is essentially unmarked and undamaged. It does get little warm if you write large files to it, but nothing unbearable.
5	1384819200	I love this flash drive. It's made of metal and is easy to clip onto a key chain. It's extremely sturdy and has a massive amount of space on it. Along with that, it's just more convenient than having a push-out or flip-type drive. Well worth the price.
5	1384819200	Very durable and dependable. I leave this flash drive on my key chain and needed something a little stronger than the standard plastic ones.  Now, I always have my flash drive with me! Worth spending the extra $ on!
5	1384819200	Durable attractive device. Performs as expected but what impressed me was appearance. Shiny finish. I wear it on my lanyard and have received a couple compliments and questions.
5	1384819200	The only thing I would add is a rubber cap to keep dust from getting inside. Blowing on the end does make me miss my old Nintendo...
5	1384732800	Very high quality flash drive.  Seems to transfer data very quickly and efficiently.  I have shown this drive to friends and they have ordered in based on its quality.
4	1384732800	Conveniently sized and does the job. A bit slow (~5mbps average for write, 12 for read) but worth the 5 bucks.
1	1384732800	I ordered 2 of these. I received only one. After contacting amazon, they got another shipped out without additional cost, however, when I recieved the second one, it is DoA. It cant be formatted, cant hold any files, and seems burnt out. I put a linux boot on the first one to try to test the second one out, and now the first one is doing the same thing, wont format, fdisk cant locate any memory, etc. On top of all that, the metal casing is very sturdy, however, seems a little too small for USB ports as I can hear the metal grind as i put them into ANY USB PORT on any of my 3 computers. Overall, I am VERY dissatisfied with the product and wish I didnt waste my money.
4	1384732800	I bought two of these at once and like them lots. Connect fast with all computers and not a bunch of preloaded junk software to slow them down. 16 gig is just right for me right now. Sturdy metal construction with nothing to break.
5	1384560000	I bought one of these to add to my carabiner so I could have a copy of Puppy Linux and some portable programs with me for PC maintenance. It came in handy several times within the first week of receiving it which was quite nice. Today I reached for it and it was gone. It's so tiny that I must have lost it while taking something else off the carabiner. For ten dollars I can't justify not buying another one though. Just a heads up to potential buyers, this thing is really tiny. I'm not the type of person to lose or misplace my possessions and I lost it in just over a week.Edit 4/12/14: Well, I lost my second one now too. I am not prone to losing the things that I carry contrary to what this review probably has you thinking. I am beginning to wonder if the loop simply broke.
5	1384473600	Get the job done and the best part is that it's hard to break. Very nice design to a single usb. Very pleased.
2	1384473600	Flash Drive failed after several weeks of use. Various computers no longer see or mount the drive. For all intents and purposes, the drive is now worthless. It wasn't that expensive but I like the form factor and had hoped that the durability and longevity would be greater.
5	1384473600	Awesome little drive. So far compatible with everything I've connected it too. Holds bookoo's of music and media files. I will likely buy another.
5	1384473600	Once-piece construction is solid and fits great on a key chain without being obtrusive.  It is only USB 2.0, so it won't be as fast as the 3.0 devices.There is no curve to the ring part as there looks to be in the picture.  There was at least one other review here that stated this, but I thought I would point it out as well.  It lays flat on either side.  The case is made to fit inside the USB socket, so there is no need for a cap or cover.  Great design!One thing is a bit puzzling.  There is a small hole on the inside of the ring centered on the stick side.  Looks as if there should be an &#34;in use&#34; indicator LED there, but there is nothing.  Maybe it is for drainage or something in case it gets wet?  Or maybe to allow for air flow when plugging in / unplugging since the case is otherwise sealed except for the plug end.  But it is small and does not get in the way of anything.
5	1384300800	It's a tight fit in many USB ports, but it works fine in all the one's I've tried. It's durable, there are no moving parts, and it's easy to clip so it won't get lost.
5	1384300800	Very sturdy little drive. I love that it is waterproof. The design is great. Fits on my keychain great. I will definitely buy another one of these drives.
5	1384214400	I actually ordered this as well as a major competitiors flash drive as frankly I could not decide between the two! While the other drive is s bit smaller I opted to use this one simply becsuse of the larger loop on the end. This allows me to use the drive while still attached to the key chain due to the extra movement allowed by the larger loop. That said this unit is still very compact slightly smaller than a regular key. Unlike some of the other reports I saw this unit has all the contacts covered by the case. I also thought based on the picture that the end might be plastic but the unit it is a solid piece completely covering the contacts. I also noticed several users mentioned that it could get wet and still function after drying.
4	1384128000	This is a sweet little flash drive. I use it a lot. Downside is that its a little big for usb slots and you really have to shove it in. because its so small its often hard to pull it out without moving the whole device you're removing it from.
2	1384128000	Solid build quality but terrible performance.  I'm only able to read from this device at just below 750 KBps which is pretty terrible.
5	1384128000	I got this after buying the similar drive made by Kingston which DID NOT work for me. I bought 2 and both were too slow to watch a video off of. This drive works great for the same price and capacity.
5	1383955200	Perfect travel mate. Easy store, use, and very desecrate. I use it to augmentmy MacAir tiny hd. Allows me to keep the machine lean inboard and functional abroad. Wish they produced a 128gb.
5	1383955200	Nice quality. l like the ring where I attached a long key chain so that I can't lose it. I needed to save all of my pictures from my old computer. On a scale of 1 to 10 for taking pictures, I'm probably a 4, but it held years worth of pictures and used about 15 of the 32GB's. Very pleased.
5	1383868800	This is my second purchased and I love the fact there are no moving parts to break! They stay on your keychain so you won't loose:) great design!
5	1383782400	That's small, ultra light, fast and efficient USB Flash Drive. Because of the ring I can keep it with my keys and never lose time to find it :)
2	1383782400	Very slow. Very-very slow. Wanted to move some large files with it, it worked all night (maybe it's Ubuntu issue, but still). Also, becomes very hot when writing lots of data.
5	1383696000	I'm quite happy with this item. It is very stylish and attaches to my key ring perfectly. Delivered promptly, as always with my Amazon orders. It is smaller than the photos might seem to imply...which is a good thing. Very nice product.
1	1383696000	Let me keep my review short by saying this USB drive will destroy your data every few days. All my work for college has been destroyed and cannot be accessed or recovered. Stay away from this product.
5	1383696000	this is my first flash drive and I wanted something that was not cheap and plastic.  Easy to operate, lots of storage and doesn't look like a piece of junk
1	1383609600	I received this item on 10/21/2013, about 2.5 weeks ago. It was slow but durable at first look.TODAY (11/5/2013) it just stop working completely. ALL my files were gone.I made sure I always ejected the flash drive properly, and I was even using it last night.With no sign, it is dead now. Very disappointed.
1	1383609600	Do NOT purchase this flash drive. It may look nice and it is convenient having the keyring built into it; however, those pros definitely do not outweigh the cons. The read and write time is incredibly slow and it isn't reliable. At first it was fine, but after a month of very limited use, the computer didn't recognize it when I plugged it in. I unplugged it and tried it in the same usb slot and it worked. I didn't think much of it, but since I was past the return policy I kept using it.Now it is a paperweight. The flash drive doesn't show up in the disk management window nor the device manager window. Get a different flash drive, preferably from a different company!
4	1383436800	These flash drives are tiny! The end fits right into a USB plug in and maybe sticks out an inch overall.  I like how sleek they are and that using the ring on top, I have been able to clip it onto my computer bag for easy access.  This is a 2.0 flash drive so the transfer speed is not the fastest but works fine for smaller file sizes, i.e. documents or photos.  Overall, this was a great product for the price and I will be using it for all my school documents.
5	1383436800	so hard to find a decent usb that doesn't feel like it will break off your key ring.not to mention this thing is uber smexy
5	1383436800	This flash drive is a lot smaller than it seems in the pictures on the web.  It is great and fits on a key chain easily.
5	1383350400	Amazing little product.Light.Reliable.Available.And it's no way no how going to break off your keyring. I use it all the time.Super price too
5	1383264000	I was looking for a sturdy 64GB USB flash drive to keep on my keychain, and the Silicon Power product looked great and the reviews others wrote helped me make the decision.Good price, solid build quality, and just the right size and shape.
5	1383264000	Great USB Flash Drive, portable, solid, reliable and perfect to keep on your key chain to carry around everywhere you go!
5	1383264000	An awesome flash drive.  The open circle at the top is very convienent for hooking onto a keychain or lanyard.
5	1383177600	This is a great little flash drive.  The large ring fits perfect on my keyring so I always have the ability to take and or share any data.  Highly recommended.
5	1383177600	this flash drive is wonderful, smaller then you would even imagine. durable metal exterior. more then satisfied with this purchase
4	1383177600	I got tired of fighting my files onto tiny 4GB or 8GB flash drives, so I ordered this one. I'm still amazed by how compact it is. It's definitely exactly what I needed, one of my favourite Amazon impulse buys ever!
4	1383177600	The SP drive is slim enough to fit into an apple keyboard slot or a double-stack USB slot without issues. The top hole is smooth and large, allowing it to fit easily on a keychain as well as make it easily grasp-able for removal from a computer. The appearance is fairly elegant as far as USB keys go (my standards are not high). It works well.
5	1383091200	I bought this drive to use as a time machine backup for my 15&#34; 2009 Macbook Pro. I went for this drive because it had a great price and I love the design. It matches my Macbook Pro, and slips nicely on my key chain. The exterior of the drive is a polished aluminum look, and it is well built and durable. The packaging also claims that it is water resistant, but I'm not about to test this claim.Design: Small, durable, lightweight. Loop enables attachment to keychain, and also makes it easy to pull the drive out of your computer and/or tv. I'm still amazed at how small these drives keep getting. A few years ago I couldn't imagine 32GB of data storage fitting into a body so small and sleek. And yet it's not so small that it is easy to lose or a pain to unplug from your computer.Functionality: This drive works on both my PC and Macbook Pro. I would suggest formatting the drive when you get it. I formatted mine first to ms dos FAT so I could use it both on my PC and Mac. Then I decided I really wanted to use this as a time machine backup, so I formatted the drive to osx journaled with encryption. Both formats worked great, but I will be sticking with the later until I change my mind.  I don't know the exact transfer rate for this drive, but all I can say is that it's very fast and efficient.I love this drive. I ended up ordering another one for my dad. He loved the design after seeing it, and has been using his drive for a few weeks now on his PC. Highly recommended!
4	1383091200	It looks like a tiny metal bottle opener, but it can't open bottles (though that would have made me give it 5 stars).It isn't the fastest UBS drive, but it gets the job done.  If you want a really fast data transfer, go elsewhere.  The metal case is a nice touch, with no cap to loose, however the drive does get stuff stuck in it when you shove it into pockets.  The metal protects it from getting beaten up on your keys, but I wouldn't carry any USB drive like that.All in all I like it, used it, and it works.
5	1383091200	Must better than the plastic flip or slide contraptions they sell. I will be getting more for sure. They are small too. Not bulky.
3	1383004800	I really like how slim and sleek this is. I keep it on my keychain so my dissertation is always with me. I love the amount of storage for the price. I dislike how it works. I thought having a no-profile USB drive would make my life easier. It doesn't make it that much easier. It is really easy to shove the drive in too far. I think this is because you don't know how far you need to push it for it to &#34;work.&#34; I end up pushing it in a little, nothing shows up, so I push it in further, and then something shows up. Without the hole, it would be much more difficult to pull this bad boy out. Thankfully, the hole doubles as a handle and a keychain ring. Haven't had any data problems yet!
5	1382918400	I like how compact ant tough this flash drive is.  It also has plenty of storage space and wasn't too expensive
5	1382918400	I use this as a bootable drive and carry it on a keychain. So far it has performed very well. I've had no problem with the housing becoming deformed (maybe I'm just lucky) even though I carry it 24/7.
5	1382918400	Shipped very quickly. Like the overall design and smallness of the USB. Haven't used it much, but like how I can attach it to a key chain and it doesn't seem to be too big. The quality is great.
5	1382832000	If you plan on using this on your keychain or facing the elements don't go cheap with the other options. This drive not only looks and feels durable, but its (electrical) shock resistant and holds up to wear and tear better than any of its competitors.
5	1382745600	The solid metal ring easily fits on a key chain and is not bulky at all, about the size of a key. I have lost several thumb drives because the connector was made of plastic or metal attached to plastic and eventually they would break off.
5	1382572800	I got this compact, thin 32 GB flash drive to mail large files across the country to a friend working with me on a project. It is just what I wanted and even more! For security I formatted it and then installed TrueCrypt to password protect everything on it. Performance is amazing!
5	1382572800	Very nice product. Small but solid design. I would highly recommend this company. The ring on the end is also very useful for pulling.
5	1382486400	I bought this drive for work files.  I have lost many drives before by leaving them in computers, or they have broke when hung on a lanyard/keyring with my work keys. This Silicon Power flash drive has very sturdy construction (metal), I love the large &#34;loop&#34; opening on the end....can slip it on a keyring/lanyard with no problem.  Hangs perfectly with keys I carry for work!  This will be one flash drive I won't lose or break!
1	1382486400	I used this flash drive once and the next time I plugged it in it wouldn't mount or show up in disk utility. What a piece of crap.
1	1382400000	Admittedly I bought this for the looks but I am super regretting that decision. The data transfer is slow and this thing gets HOT fast and stays hot. You can barely touch it to get it out of your computer or TV. I'm returning it first thing in the morning.
5	1382400000	more than what I Expected if u are looking for a flash drive Silicon Power is the best one you will ever have..
5	1382400000	Smaller than expected and clearly for heavier duty use.But the real value is what happens when you plug it in. Once it was nestled comfortably in the USB port, I saw some crackling electricity and then a telephone booth arose from the floor. Inside was me from the future, where my band &#34;Wyld Stallyns&#34; had been a transformative philosophical force. I knew it was me because I was able to correctly guess the number I was thinking of. Long story short, this device helped me avoid being shipped off to military school because I was able to get a history paper done.
5	1382313600	Since there are multiple flash drives listed under this product name, I would like to clarify that I purchased the 64GB one with model number SP064GBUF2F80V1S.Briefly, this flash drive is awesome. I can't recommend it enough. It is beautifully compact and very strong. It is also much faster than any of the sandisk cruzer drives I've used before. There is nothing bad I can say about it other than I almost wish it had a little LED light somewhere. I would not hesitate to buy more of these drives, should the need arise.For a more detailed review, continue reading:Design:The design of this drive is amazing. It feels great in the hand. It does not flex at all, and it really feels like it could take a beating. It is made from an aluminum zinc alloy, and it doesn't seem to scratch very easily. Mine looks perfectly new after well over two months of use. The only sign that it has ever been touched by human hands is the slight wear on the USB contacts. You have to look really close to be able to see this. The ring on the end of it is just about big enough to fit your pinky finger through. The widest point of the ring on this drive is narrower than my SanDisk Cruzer retractable drives. It appears to be made from one piece of metal, although I could be wrong. I can't find a seam anywhere. The profile of this drive is about two thirds the thickness of my sandisk cruzers. When viewed from the side, the flash drive is a uniform thickness until it reaches the ring part. At the ring, it smoothly tapers off to about one-half the thickness of the rest of the drive.Operation:One thing that bugs me about USB drives is that I always seem to put it in the wrong way. With this drive, just make sure the engraved "SP" and "64GB" marking are facing up(for a laptop). It is a little tighter fitting than my SanDisk drives, but it feels solid and doesn't wiggle in the USB port. Some of the other reviews mention this drive getting hot, which it does. It is metal, so it conducts heat very well. All flash storage of this capacity get warm. It is also a matter of scale. This thing does not get nearly hot enough to burn you. It is probably only 20 degrees warmer than the room. It just might surprise you when you find that it is slightly warm.File Transfer:I was debating whether or not to spend some extra money and get a USB 3.0 flash drive. I am actually glad I didn't, because I can get double the capacity for less money. This USB 2.0 USB drive is at least 5MB/s faster than my sandisk drives. I don't know if it's because they are lower capacity (8GB and 16GB), but they are consistently slower than this drive. When copying a 1GB movie file, transferred to the disk at speeds between 11.5 and 14MB/s. My 16GB sandisk only writes the file at 8-10MB/s. When copying the same movie back to my hard drive, it transferred at 28-31MB/s. The SanDisk only read at 20-25MB/s. I bought this drive expecting similar speeds to the Sandisk retractable cruzer USB, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that this Silicon Power 64GB USB was consistently faster.Summary:Overall, this is the best USB flash drive I have ever used. At 64GB, it is large enough to carry just about anything. It is also small enough to fit in your pocket or on the ring of a three-ring binder. It is super durable, and it looks and feels nice. If I ever need to purchase another USB storage device, I will definitely start my search with this one. The only thing that would make it better in my opinion is an ice blue LED illuminating the ring when it's plugged in. There is a tiny hole inside the ring that goes down into the drive from the key chain end. I don't know what is's purpose is, (It probably is what allowed them to get the storage in so there are no seams) but I think a LED would add a nice touch. As far as I know though, no other company offers anything like this. I imagine it was an issue with space, because an LED might add a little bulk. This is a purely cosmetic request, and it isn't anything that should stand in your way of purchasing this item.I will be sure to update this review if anything changes with this drive. I have been using it often for the past two months though, and It has given me no trouble so far. I would highly recommend this for anyone who needs a super portable way to carry around a lot of data.
5	1382313600	Its awesome, sleak, and exactly what I was looking for. I'll have to get the gold 64gb next time for sure.
1	1382313600	I bought it around the 2 October within a moth of purchase it has stop working and would not connect to my computer. I bought this USB  due to the fact I could put it on my key ring, which is highly important to me since I'm a student.It is a sensitive device and not device for putting on your key ring. If you want a USB for that purpose than don't buy this one.P.s always back up your files just in case. I made that mistake :(
5	1382313600	Sturdy, reliable, handy, and extremely portable and powerful 32GB usb stick. The design is very clean being the chosen material the most remarkable part of it.
4	1382227200	The USB drive is super small and fits perfectly on my keychain.  The device works great so far and fits all my needs.
5	1382140800	I have used it to save studying materials and movies. It works pretty well,and it can be hang on the key chain.
5	1382140800	Flash drives have come down in price considerably in recent years, and now we have many great options (like this one from Silicon Power) at the price point that it's almost too trivial to matter. Even as more and more of our files are being transferred to the cloud, it's still great to have an easily accessible physical storage available for a quick transfer of files between your computers and other devices.One of the most appealing aspects of this flash drive is its design. It is very compact, simply-designed, and being made out of single metal piece incredibly sturdy. The flash drive is meant to be carried around on a key-chain, which is very convenient and secure. (I've lost too many flash drives over the years that I had been carrying in my pocket or the messanger bag.) However, if your key-chain happens to be very cluttered with keys and other carry-on items then you will want to attach and detach the flash drive whenever you use it. This can be a bit of a pain with this design, and I recommend you get a small carabiner for that purpose.The main reason I wanted a really large capacity flash drive is for the purpose of transferring and watching large video files. As the true HD recording (1080p) becomes ubiquitous in all of our video recording devices, the size of the recorded files can increase beyond what is easily transferrable. However, even if you have a really large flash drive like this one, you may not be able to transfer some of the really large files. This flash drive, like most other ones out there, is formatted to the Fat32 file system. This is a very widely spread file system, easily readable by the Mac, Windows, Linux computer, as well as a wide assortment of smart TVs, Blu Ray players, tablets, etc. Unfortunately this file system has the disadvantage that it limits the file size to 4 GB. So I decided to try out a few other file system formattings, and I discovered that the one that overall worked the best was NTSF. It allows for much larger files, but unfortunately it's not as easily readable by the variety of devices as the Fat32. One of its advantages is that it's recognized by a variety of modern Blu Ray players, as well as Google TV and perhaps some other smart TVs. It works natively with the Windows machines, and it can be also accessed from Macs with the use of third-party software. So far it has been a really great and efficient way of getting to watch my home videos on the big screen.Overall, this is a great flash drive that with a bit of tinkering can be used for a variety of very cool purposes. Strongly recommended.
5	1382140800	Looks great, fits handily into my computer, even when on my keyring, many smaller jump drives that I have purchased do not fit while still attached to the keyring, especially if I have anything else in my usb ports.  Looks very modern too.
5	1382054400	cool design, awesome price point, good build quality, only design suggestion would be to put a cover, flap or cap over the USB opening to protect it, since most likely people will put this on their keychain (as i did)
5	1382054400	This product is just what it looks like.  A cheap flash drive you can easily put on your keyring, so you always have one with you. It really is small/unobtrusive, and much nicer than anything I saw in Target.  I really like the minimalist design with no ugly plastic.
5	1382054400	I used to backup baby pictures. I can save and retrieve easily. Does what i need. I think the price is fair.
5	1382054400	This thing is way smaller than I though it would be based on the pictures. It is tiny, and I mean tiny. While it is tiny, it is solid and durable, and holds a crap-load of stuff. I had like 13 movies on there, and there was still quite a bit more room on there. Impressive.
5	1381968000	I like the small form factor and and ability to always have it with me on a key chain. There is no cover but that doesn't bother me. Works as expected.
5	1381968000	This is the perfect flash drive for a key ring.  The metal finish appears well made and durable (I have had many plastic drives that have only survived for a limited time on my key ring).  It looks good.  It is quite small (the last thing I want is something bulky added to an already bulky set of keys). Most importantly, it works and is reasonably (for the price) fast.
4	1381968000	I gave it a 4 because it could not be recognized in my gadget. I choose to stay with it  because of its size and quality.
5	1381881600	I bought this flash drive to litsen to musics in my car. It is very light and small, saving some spaces of the tray right in front of USB port. 32GB is plenty of space for my music collection. I strongly recommend this flash drive for anyone.
5	1381881600	Love this thing!  It fits on to your keys and its waterproof.  I'm not planning on going swimming with it but its a nice touch.  Even though it is small the Aluminum is tough and i can't see it breaking easily.
2	1381881600	This pendrive has limited use.  If you need to access data quickly, such as in installing and operating system on it to boot from, go somewhere else. Also, transferring large files is very slow, regardless of drive formatting used.  Try Patriot Xporter or Patriot Supersonic, which are fast.
1	1381881600	Mine actually shows slightly under 29GB, which is a fairly hefty percentage decrease from the stated capacity.And it's flimsy.  The metal bends easily, and the internals shift around inside the case when the metal moves.  This one won't stand up to lengthy keychain service, unlike the Kingston Data Traveler.
5	1381881600	so far so good.It is very fast and well built. Not hot when running.Don't know it is waterproof or not.
5	1381881600	I love this flash drive. It's portable, it's durable, it has lots of storage, and it works great. I'd recommend it to anyone needing a reliable USB drive on the go.
5	1381795200	I use this on my keychain and I'm never scrambling for a usb drive anymore.  I'm picky about not having bulky keys in my front pocket and this feels nice in my jeans.
5	1381795200	This flash drive has tons of space to save things and easily clips to my keys. I can take it where ever I go without the worry of little pieces breaking off.
1	1381708800	I have had this for about 3 months.  I have used it on probably a dozen occasions, never filling it more than 10GB probably.  Yesterday it just stopped working.  Tried 3 different computers and it won't even show up in device manager (windows) or disk utility (mac).  It gets very hot weirdly when I plug it in.  Something inside it went very wrong.  If it hadn't broken I would love this thing, but to make it even worse it is now past amazon's return policy, so I am forced to open an RMA request with some company in Taiwan, and pay for the postage to Taiwan to get it repaired at this point.  Sigh.
4	1381708800	Durable with nice design, was looking for keychain product that would hold up. Others lost caps, broken tethers, cracked plastic frames. All of my concerns have been addressed by this product, durability will be proven over time. Found the data read/write speeds to be less than expected, and it gets a bit warm with heavy use.
2	1381708800	I ordered a Silicon Power 64 GB thumb drive.  The packaging says 64 GB.  The printing on the drive itself says 64 GB.  But when I placed the drive in my computer it says that the thumb drive has 32 GB of storage.  Thumbs down.
4	1381708800	So far so goodI like the small convenient size32GB does not loose as much GB as the 64 (per GB) which is goodLarge loop gives greater variety when looking for a carrierHave not tested for speed as it not important to my usage
5	1381622400	It is very simple, this is a superior product brought to you by Amazon.com at a very competitive price. Would buy again with further needs for memory.
5	1381536000	Nice thumb drive and it can actually hang on my key ring without being destroyed. I don't bother to measure speed. Just need to work when I shove it in the computer and not make me wait long enough for me to think about how long I've been waiting ;-) That it does. I've only been using it a few days but I'm quite happy with it.
5	1381536000	After having a Sandisk Cruzer Fit break on me in about 5 days (SanDisk Cruzer Flash Drive SDCZ33 032G B35I decided this looked more sturdy even if it was a tiny bit bigger and I hadn't heard of the brand.Perfect purchase. It's been through drops, rain, and heavy use for 5 months now with zero problems. Speed is fast for USB 2.0 - I can easily put up with not having USB 3.0 for a few more years even with the huge files I transfer on it. It looks sleek and will probably last for many years.
4	1381536000	I picked this drive over the similarly priced Kensington drive after reading a lot of reviews claiming the storage literally fell out of the Kensington drive after a few weeks of use.Overall, I like this drive a lot. The form factor is great, because it easily fits on my key ring and doesn't add much bulk. The price was great too. In hindsight, I wish I'd gone with a USB 3.0 drive. However, the price, size, and apparent durability of the device make it a great choice.
4	1381449600	I liked the product. The only thing I am not sure if it's normal is that it gets really hot after a while of usage. May be it's normal!
3	1381363200	Size is good and it looks cool.  I think it'll fit in a keyring if you want.However, I just used it for the first time on my MacBook Pro for 30 minutes or so.  It got really hot.  I have never experienced this before.  I'm a bit doubtful about this.  As soon as I took it out it was fine but I'm going to have to watch out.
5	1381363200	It is very fast, organized and a cute flash drive. Price was fair and I am happy that purchased it.
5	1381276800	This is exactly what I've been looking for!  I have gone through so many jump drives that have broken off of my keychain!  This one is made of metal, has no moving parts, and works exceptionally well.  I would recommend this product to anyone!
5	1381276800	This usb flash drive is really cool. Not big, not too small either. With 32Gb is excellent to put many data (pics, movies, etc). I really like the design and would recommend it to my friends.
5	1381276800	One-piece zinc alloy case feels like a solid chunk of metal and its integrated loop is great for hanging on a keychain or lanyard.  Only thing I would wish for is a status light.
1	1381276800	Bought the 8 gb version. Copying onto the drive speed (write speed) is 3.2 mbyte per second. That means to use the full 8 gb you need to wait 42 minutes. I haven't seen any type storage sold in the year 2013 that is this slow. Read speed is 15 mb/sec which is OK.It also gets quite warm which means it draws a lot of power. If you use this thing on a notebook you drain it's battery unnecessarily.
1	1381276800	I purchased this flash drive in the hope of having something reliable. That not the case. I am a design student who is constantly having to save multiple version of file and having a flash drive that could connect to my key chain was extremely convenient. Under its description it says "Water, dust, shock and vibration proof", I beg to differ other wise. I only carry two keys along with the flash drive and my keys are always stored in a safe location when I am not driving. Ive had the flash drive with me for 2 months before it crashed. A system error accrued and I tried to restore the device but the window closed on me and denied me access to the flash drive leaving me unconnected to my very important files.I highly recommend that you DO NOT CONNECT THEM TO YOUR KEY CHAIN. Its highly sensitive and will crash. Always back up your files and learn from my mistake.
5	1381190400	I needed a small flash drive that I could carry around easily, this one has exceeded my expectations! It is small and unobtrusive on my keychain and looks like its durability is going to serve me for a while!
5	1381190400	Cool design.  Very neat, elegant, minimalist design.  No frills, simple, and gets the job done!  The keychain loop is why I got this flashdrive, great feature.
5	1381104000	I had never seen a flash drive like this before, and it was the size I needed and it looked neat so I ordered it. The product is smaller than the photo makes it appear, which is actually great. I love the aluminum casing and the large key ring.Shipping was fast and friendly. I highly recommend this drive to anyone.
5	1381104000	EXCELLENT PRODUCT IS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. THE FLASH DRIVE IS SMALL AND VERY NICE. THANKS. A +
5	1381104000	No complaints so far.  It came quickly, is nice and sturdy with a hoop to put on my keychain.  The data transfer from my computer is definitely faster than other USB drives I have (like the aluminum Kingston ones I have).  Not many choices for all metal USB sticks so I would recommend this.  I don't recommend getting anything with a plastic key chain ring as it will break or something with a removable cap as it will stop staying on after a while.
5	1381017600	For what it is and the price I love it!!!! Small and light weight but durable. Unlike flash drives I have had in the past it is nice that this one easily fits on my key chain so no chance of losing it without losing the keys (which of course has happened).
4	1381017600	This thing is great. It is small, durable, and fast. Data transfer was fast, and read time was good. Even fast enough to watch high def movies directly from the drive.The only potential issue I had occurred while I was running an OS (Ubuntu 13.10) off of it. It became rather hot, and the transfer rate slowed down enough that I noticed the difference.Ultimately, if you want to use this for the general storage of documents and media, it performs nicely.
5	1380931200	I mainly keep this on a carabiner attached to my backpack so I never worry about it being crushed in my pocket but it feels sturdy and had plenty of room for assignments.
4	1380844800	Especially for less than $25. I've only had a it about a week, so I'll have to see how well this holds up the daily abuse of being on my keychain, which was my main reason in purchasing. It seems to be a reasonably fast USB 2.0 drive though I haven't speed tested it. The PortableApp's suite seems to run as well off of this drive as ever, for what that's worth. I love knowing that I always have a flash drive on me with plenty of space, if ever I need it. very happy with my purchase.
5	1380844800	I bought this flash drive to use exclusively on my Xbox 360 instead of buying a larger hard drive. It works fine and met the standards for the Xbox. Can't beat the price.
5	1380844800	Awesome little drive. Solidly built. Fits right on my keychain but doesn't get in the way. Could not ask for more. Will be buying more soon.
3	1380758400	The only reason I tried this is because it is made of aluminum and should stay cool.  I bought Kingston Datatraveler, similar design and they get piping hot in my computer.  When this Silicon Power flash drive arrived, I was hopeful.  I noticed it is lighter weight than the Kingston, so I know it is aluminum.  I figured this is what I am looking for.  Plus no other reviews complained about them getting hot.  These are a little larger than the Kingston, so I would say the Kingston is better looking.  The Kingston also feels better because of the weight and the cool coin sound it makes when you set them down on a table.Sadly, these Silicon Power flash drives get just as hot as the Kingston Datatraveler.  Personally, I like the name of Kingston better, better package, and get hot just the same.  I will stick with Kingston Datatraveler for further purchases until something similar comes around that actually stays cool.I gave the Kingston 4 stars, took away 1 star for heat problems.  With the Silicon Power usb drive, I took away 1 star for heat problems, and 1 star for being slightly less cute than the Kingston and not exactly having an established name.  So 3 star is fair.  On the other hand, if I were to compare the Silicon Power usb drive to any other plastic usb drive, I would give the Silicon Power 5 stars.
5	1380758400	Works great so far. I did reformat as NTFS to handle large files. (It was originally FAT32.)  Kdy ring is a nice touch.
5	1380758400	This little flash drive is perfect for my keychain.  I got the 64GB version and its perfectly shaped.  It's got just the right amount of heft and doesn't feel cheap or like it will easily bend or break.  Nothing plastic about it.  Gotta love it.UPDATE:  After using this for a few days I realized it is missing one feature.  It doesn't light up or otherwise signal you when it is actively reading or writing data.  So you have to be careful not to unplug it too quick after "finishing" a task.  It might not actually be finished yet.
5	1380672000	This is going really well with your key-chain because of the shrinking design of the top.Alluminum case is great and cool
5	1380672000	Perfect little flash drive that fits easily on a keychain and stores 32gb of data. It's a great backup device, and it looks good too.
5	1380672000	This product was as described, both sturdy and light weight. It required no formatting and worked well with my mac at home and PC at work. I especially like that it has the loop on the end so I can keep it handy on a key chain.
5	1380672000	I LIKE THESE BECAUSE THEY ARE TOUGH. I EVEN HAD ONE GO THROUGH MY WASHING MACHINE WITH BLEACH AND ALL AND IT WORKS JUST FINE. I GOT TIRED OF THE PLASTIC FLASH DRIVES THAT START TO COME APART, RUST IF THEY GET WET. THOSE COULD NOT SURVIVE A WASHING MACHINE THE WAY THESE DID. I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE ONLY THIS TYPE OF FLASH DRIVE FOR MY FUTURE NEEDS.
4	1380672000	This is smaller than I expected which is a good thing!  I put it on my keychain and it's not bulky so it blends right in.  The only thing I wish it had was an option to create a password to get into the drive.  I fear that if my keys get lost or stolen then someone can get all my personal data and pictures.  It doesn't look like a typical flash drive so maybe no one would know that's what it is on my keys.  I do love the item because it is so small and kinda hidden.
4	1380672000	Excellent drive except for its small size.  Sometimes, it's hard to maneuver, but it seems pretty strong. The lack of a cap to protect the inside doesn't seem to cause any problems.  It came with some &#34;sync&#34; software that I don't use.  As a multi-computer-user, I had to reformat it to FAT so all the computers would be able to use it.
5	1380585600	DOES NOT WORK ON THE OUYA CONSOLE.I purcased this for my Ouya console because of both the brushed metal appearance matched the case, it's small and blends into the device well and I felt the memory available wa s abargain for the price paid. It is a fantastic thumb drive and the quality is quite exceptional. It did not however, work on my ouya console, which was disappointing.
5	1380585600	At first it would seem like the item is bigger in the pictures, but it was perfect sized for my keychain.I simply slid it right in to the key ring, and it goes everywhere that i go now. This is very useful since as a techy person one never knows when they will need a certain program for a virus scan, etc.For $12 a 16GB device, it deserves the 5 stars. Recommended.
3	1380585600	Ordered the 64GB version. Ran a benchmark on it, and it is able to write at 10 MB/sec.Hard metal shell is very nice.Takes about an hour to fill from empty to full.
5	1380585600	Small, great price and love the feature of putting it on keychain.  I will be buying more of them soon!
5	1380499200	Love this little flash drive.  It's very small and compact and can be hung on a key chain or attached to anything for safe keeping.  Just what I was looking for!
4	1380499200	I love flash drives. this one is fairly ordinary in its appearance, performance & workmanship and was pretty cost efficient.
5	1380499200	This USB is even smaller than I thought it would be! Blends in perfectly on keys and I love it!
4	1380499200	I am a little disappointed that I purchased a 32GB drive and when I inserted it to format it, it shows up as only 30GB. Overall the price I paid for this drive I am not entirely displeased, however even factoring in lost space due to certain formatting, I feel that a total of 2GB is a little unreasonable. All in all, I would purchase another, but be prepared you will not get the amount of space promised.
1	1380499200	I received this usb stick and after one partition with Mac disk utility and after a couple file transfers it stopped working. The computer didn't even know it was plugged into the port. I tried it on multiple computers to no avail. I purchased two of these and the other one is working for now. So I'm hoping it was just defective from the get go; which I'm sure is bound to happen from time to time. The major annoyance is that I lost a lot of crucial data that I trusted would be fine on the device. Otherwise the stick looks great and fits nicely on a keychain.
1	1380240000	Died after ten minutes and ten gigabytes of use. Then it wouldn't show up in Explorer. I just don't think that is acceptable.
1	1380240000	I like these low-profile USB sticks with a large loop in the casing, and the lack of moving parts. Unfortunately after using it only a few times in the months since I got it, during the most recent attempt it will no longer mount/install or be recognized on either my Win or Mac machines. Can't seem to find any drivers online for it so I guess it's done. Lame.
5	1380240000	64gb storage on a small sleek design for under $40?  Very good for the money.  Only issue was I had to reformat to NTFS as my WD TV player wouldn't recognise exFAT.  Not a big deal though.
5	1380153600	Bought this to transfer files from my laptop to my computer - it was slow, but the files were very large, so not sure if that's the USB's fault. Overall, I was happy with it. Read all the reviews and chose this one.
5	1380153600	This is a really good flash drive ,nice metal finish fits nicely on my key chain.I take it every where with me I have a few Linux distors on it and Anti-virus Anti malware software on it is great worth every penny.
5	1380067200	This is going to be a great tool for me, Since i mess around with pcs often and has plenty of space . got it on the promised day, you got to love amazons fast shipping. I'm definitely getting another at some point.
1	1379980800	I spent more money on a flash drive to get something that will last ... It stopped working before even lasting 1 month
5	1379808000	Its much smaller than i thought, which is great. Fits perfectly on my keychain and seems quite durable. It is indeed made of aluminum and isn't just aluminum colored.
1	1379721600	If you're going to buy an aluminum usb key, BACK UP FREQUENTLY.I think these things COOK until the chip is dead. It only lasted 4 months. This is the 2nd aluminum cased USB that has died on me. No other usb drives HAVE EVER DIED except with these metal ones.I think the heat is too much and I suspect that's a standard problem with these types uf usb flash drives
4	1379721600	It seems to be a good item. A little concerned about the lack of a cover on the business end.
5	1379721600	If you're looking for something you can throw on a keychain, always have on you, and not have to worry, this is exactly what you're looking for.
5	1379635200	This Flash Drive is easy to carry from home to office and lightweight. Love that it is 64Gb and the price was right.
5	1379635200	I like this drive so much I carry 2. Everyone that has got their hands on one these tries to keep (I tell them no, but if they are supa cool I get them their own).Pros:reliablefeels and acts solidfits comfortably on your keychainit's designed well enough that it actually feels good in your handCon'sno bottle opener (but reliability is better than a bottle opener)
1	1379548800	I bought this flash drive for the form factor and size- 32 gb. Very happy with product on arrival (although transfer speeds were very slow) but after a month, it no longer works. I have tried multiple computers. Unfortunately, I lost greater than 14 gb of data that I had stored to keep with me at work...Too bad, it seemed promising.
5	1379548800	This Flash Drive is simple, basic and reliable.  I'm a routine and avid Systems Adminstrator, and routinely use flash drives for work and play.  Here is the reason.  Most flash drives are enclosed in a package that allows for sliding in and out, or flipping to protect the end.  With use, these will crack, bend or break and often affect the ability for proper or full insertion.  As well, many are bulky and will not allow for multiple drives to be inserted either above or side by side without some rubbing.  I originally bought these drives for my kids to use with their XBOX live profiles.  Before they would only be able to place one drive or I would grab an extender cable to allow room.  With these, I can fill all the ports and no drama.  You know the story, one kid wants to play, removes the other kids, next thing you know they are all grounded and the XBOX goes in the closet (maybe not for you, but definately in my house).The large capacity allows me to load multiple mini OS's for troubleshooting or laptop rebuilds.  Great products.
5	1379548800	This Flash Drive is perfect. I needed one to save pictures and videos. I love Silicon because they are small and handy to just put in your purse or attach to your keychain. Great quality:)
1	1379548800	The computer wouldn't recognize the device. Return and refund was no problem at all so I wouldn't hesitate to do business with the manufacturer again. I think we just got a random bad device.
5	1379462400	Biggest plus here is that since it's so different-looking from the other flash drives I have, it's easy to identify it (and therefore what I have on it) amongst the other flash drives I own.
5	1379462400	great design. could work like a key chain. had no problem with the unit so far.Will update after a couple weeks.
5	1379462400	I LOVE this little flash drive, I have it on my key ring and it works beautifully! Just pop it in (fits quite snugly, but that's fine by me) and you're ready to go! Simple drag and drop or copy/paste, no program software to deal with! Comes out to $0.64 a GB, decent enough, and I love that it's so little and goes with you on a keychain (makes it much harder to lose it, that way!. I highly recommend!!
5	1379462400	Got my 64 Gig flash drive, and I transferred all of my mp3 files from my computer over to it to free up space on my computer's hard drive. So far, the flash drive is working well. Hopefully it will continue to work well for a long time. :)
5	1379462400	Nice and tiny. Works well. however usb 2.0 is really slow. I am thinking about to buy a usb 3.0 now.
5	1379376000	I bought this to carry my important work and personal documents with me at all times. It's much smaller than I anticipated which is great since I carry it in my key chain. It good firmly in my USB port. The free software for auto back up and document protection are cool too. Although it was no good to me as the software requires the documents to be used on a specific computer. Other than that AWESOME!
5	1379289600	I put this on my keys to carry it with me every time I go out, I recommend encrypting the USB so you can carry importance files as well.
5	1379289600	It's small, it's easy to carry, it's pretty. You can put it on any keychain and it will go well with it. Just plug it in and you're good to go. Really great for college students.
5	1379289600	This drive is what I was looking for.I have purchased drives for my key chain, but the connectors were not very strong and they broke off.This one is very well built and looks like it will last a long time.No edges go get caught on and pulled off.The drive inserts well and stays in even with my full key ring.If you are looking for a great key ring drive that wont break off, I recommend this one.
4	1379030400	I have yet to use the flash drive but it arrived ahead of time and it looks to be what was advertised. The reason I gave it four stars is that it is smaller and more fragile looking than I thought it would be, I hope I don't lose it.
5	1378857600	I bought this thumb drive for daughter to use for school. She loves it. We are a Mac family but the school is all PC. I was able to partition the drive, half Mac and half pc (exfat). That way she can plug it into a Mac or pc and store/retrieve data. Thanks for a wonderful product. Btw, it looks and feels really cool and futuristic.
4	1378857600	Nice and very fast.  I did find a design flaw.There appears to be an indicator in the ring of the device to show when it is being accessed but never lights up.  Checked the manual and it is not referenced in any way so perhaps it was a feature that did not get enabled
1	1378857600	This flash drive did open quickly but had several documents/programs attached that would not work properly and when you open them they just kept taking you back to the products website.  Then the SP widget that was supposed to come with it was not loaded and had to be downloaded from a special website.  This program was a disaster and on Windows XP would add trash to the desktop; and on Windows 7 the systems malware said the site was a security risk and would not let it be safely downloaded.  After several evening of emailing Taiwan it was just a game of how long you could respond to questions and send screenshot attachments.  Good size and shape and secure on keychain but not able to add it&#8217;s recommended security that it is supposed to be compatible.  If you want a drive with NO password protection just plain storage to hang on a key chain it is recommended.
5	1378771200	The drive works really well and is convenient to have on a key chain or lanyard. It's nice that it is waterproof and seems very durable to use as an everyday item.
5	1378684800	I have a bunch of keys and it holds up when inserted and they are being hung from the drive.  Formatted for windows 7, its only 30GB.  32GB is unformatted, but I assume its that way with all thumb drives.
5	1378512000	The metal is nice and the device is smaller (which is a good thing) than I expected. Fits perfectly on my key ring and transfers at a high rate. Well done.
5	1378425600	This product is great!I'm glad to have the days of carrying around a crappy plastic flash drive behind me,as every flash drive I've carried around like that has screwed up in some way.This drive is built stronger though, and its small and compact.I only wish there was a USB 3.0 version, but I'm sure they'll make that in the future.NOTE: This flash drive does not work with Windows XP. Or maybe mine's just formatted wrong or something, idk.However, I'm still not taking off a star because really you shouldn't be using XP in today's day and age lol.
5	1378339200	I bought this to store my CDs on. I had converted them all to MP3 files and wanted a way to preserve them all as electronic files. Plus, they were taking up a huge amount of space on my hard drive. With the flash drive, I can go anywhere and play anything I want to hear, including my bootleg collection. Of course, the downside is I need a device with a 2.0 USB input, so it's not as convenient as something like an iPod, but that hasn't been a problem yet because all the places I go have an 2.0 input (computer, DVD player, widescreen TV, etc) so it's worked out well. This thing has 64 GBs, and with that much space I've been able to put everything I have on it and still have enough space left over to put anything else I get in the future on it (most likely). Again, the main reason I bought it was for storage. For mainly playing, the iPod would be a much better choice. I thought about getting an external hard-drive and that's still a good possibility, but for the price and purpose I chose the flash drive.
1	1378339200	Lovely package, plenty fast, but worked for about two weeks before failing completely. Won't mount or format on any of Mac, PC or Linux. Unfortunately I'm just past the Amazon return period, and the RMA process for Silicon Power means I have to mail it back to Taiwan (they appear to have no US presence). That's going to cost me nearly as much as buying a new one - except that I'll never buy one from these guys again. I recommend that you purchase another brand and avoid this one.
5	1377907200	I really like the size of this drive and I attached a spare lanyard that I had from a small flashlight. It is very fast to up or download data. Coworkers now want one for themselves. I highly recommend this item.
5	1377820800	This is an awesome flash drive.  I tried a bunch of different keychain type drives and this is by far the best one.- Looks great; good shape and size, and appears to be well made- Fast- Waterproof- Price is right, and it has a lifetime warrantyThe only con is that the metal is a bit soft, so stiff USB ports may leave minor scratches.
5	1377820800	Great product. Light weight and sturdy.  I was expecting the device to run really hot but after a day in my chromebook (used the drive to watch a movies on my chromebook) it was just fine. The cool factor of having 64gb of storage on demand is awesome (60.1 usable on my win7 machine)
5	1377734400	In the day of modern technology, it is delightful to have a gadget that is exceptionally portable.  I love the design.  I love the fact that no one in my class has one just like this.  It works as it is designed to.  With the capacity of this drive I am able to store an entire semester's worth of essays, lesson plans and even a few graphics here and there.Innovative and utterly cool!
5	1377561600	I really like the size and aluminum construction - easily added to a keychain, however it doesn't have the fastest write speed.  Waiting for release of the same product (size & shape) in USB 3.0.
5	1377561600	Unlike similar ones from different brands on the market, this one set's itself apart due to the simplicity and functionality. Notice the slim-rimmed ring is responsible for it to dangle freely and loosely from my splint ring-- unlike the Kingston alternative. The Kingston just juts out snobbishly like a sore thumb as though it were too refined a piece of hardware to mingle with the rest of my primitive, hard keys. This is especially so on crowded, smaller splint rings.Trust me and just get it, I tell you! Don't buy 10 others till you find you've come to the same conclusion that I have!
1	1377561600	I have had the drive for two days now I work on a number of different computers & operating systems.  It works fine on any Vista or better OS as long as it has a USB 2.0.  On all other devices (8 and counting) it is recognized as a generic USB drive & requires formatting before use (deleting all the data).  The manufacturer says this isn't a problem, but google returns numerous complaints saying the same.  Something about the driver not being compatible.Either way I will be returning it(ETA)it appears the device has died, must have been defective
5	1377475200	Product is smaller that I had expected, but nothing wrong with that.  Product is small and portable and perfect! Love it!
5	1377302400	Don't usually review products because of time but I always look at reviews and decided if I benefit from them, I should contribute to them.  If you're on the fence about which one to buy, look no further.  This little baby goes right on your key ring and can hold your whole music library.  (Ok, well almost)  Perfect size, perfect weight, really good feel and supposedly waterproof.  We shall see.  So far it has worked flawlessly and I love it.  Some may have a hard time connecting to computer with it on their key ring.  It all depends on how many keys you have on your key ring.  Does this come in a 128GB?!  Will probably be buying more of these.  I'm waiting to see how long they last.  They do have a lifetime warranty if you take the time to register them.  (still need to do that.)  Hope you like yours as much as I like mine.  Pretty soon you'll be able to back up your whole computer to one of these.  Picture can be a little confusing because it shows 5 different drives.  I like the one with the round loop on one end and the usb on the other.  It will be smaller than the picture which you'll love.  This drive is a little tight going into my car stereo but still works with a gentle push.  Need a quick disconnect to take it on and off key ring now.  Great job Silicon Power!
5	1377302400	Device is extremely tiny and is smaller than a house key. Love the fact it's waterproof and has no cap to lose.
3	1377302400	I didn't look at the size of the drive. It is very cool looking, and easy to use, just push it in. Unfortunately, it was formatted to 32 GB (FAT32) by Win8 when I made it a Recovery Drive. I tried re-formating it to NTFS, but that didn't help. Nice drive, look at the size first, then use it.
3	1377129600	all the futures that come with this device, are not available for mac users (at least in all the apple devices i tried it on)
5	1377129600	I bought one then I bought one again, why...because it is fast, low price compared to storage capacity and sleek design and reliable
3	1377129600	Bought the 32GB and got only 29GB but I liked the size, sleekness and keychain details. So I bought the 64GB and it tells me I really only have 57GB-what the heck happened to 7GB of what I thought I paid for? I would have gladly given the Silicon Power Firma 32GB and 64GB 5 stars but this blatant false advertising (that gets worse as you get into the higher gigs)is really not cool. I would return it but the Kingston 64GB I bought with similar metal casing also tells me I only get 57GB. Is this due to some technological deficiency or am I just getting ripped off?  Maybe other customers who have more tech background will comment....
5	1377129600	I was looking for a USB flash drive to carry on a keychain in jeans pocket. It had to be compact and sturdy. After doing some research Silicon Power Firma ZN is what I've chosen.Pros:- small- strong alloy body- stylish (better than a competitor in the same form-factor)Cons:- USB 2.0 (however, I couldn't find any similar product with USB 3.0, to be honest)To be seen:- contact surface is pretty well protected by the alloy body. I wonder if lint and dust buildup will cause any kind of problems in the future? Should be easy to cure with compressed air, though.Overall - good value. Very happy with the purchase.

4	1377043200	Fantastic keychain stick. The large loop allows it to sit comfortably among many keys on my keychain, something the far more common small hole on most other USB sticks do not. Being all solid, rather than having swivels or caps or push-in/out movement means it'll also last a lot longer.I do wish it was 3.0, made of solid metal to add heft (to be fair, there are next to no USB sticks that feel solid in hand), and came in a wide range of colors, but otherwise, I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
5	1377043200	Fantastic Product.Worked right out of the box, no issues at all.It was a lot smaller than the image makes it look. Freakish how they manage to fit 32GB into a unit that small.Have to be careful since the outer metal is brushed metal so scared to scratch it or dent it.The ring design helps while disconnecting the device, well thought out.Amazon as usual is awesome at shipping in 48 hours.
5	1377043200	Purchased the 32GB version some time ago.  Have been so please I wanted another SP Firma and decided to go with the larger sized option of the 64GB. I am just as please with it as my first purchase.  I especially like the convenience of being able to carry it on my key chain and the solid construction of the case. Excellent products. Highly recommend.
2	1376697600	For Some reason I got the 64 gig flash drive and when I backed up the flash drive I lost 32 gigs of info I might of gotten a bad Flash drive.  Hopefully someone from the company can contact me and let me know how to fix this problem.
5	1376697600	This thing is strong! It looks great and it's small and super easy to fit on a key chain. I'm not techy guy, but I know how to use a flash drive, and this certainly gets the job done fairly quickly. No complaints at all. Plus 32GB is huge (for me). I'm certain I wont have to ever buy another flash drive.
5	1376611200	This product arrived quickly, required no complex setup whatsoever, and functions exactly as advertized. I am very impressed with its read/write speed and its incredibly compact form-factor. I will definitely order another one of these.
5	1376611200	This flash drive is a great fit on my key ring and holds all my data.  It is smaller than it appeared in the pictures (it's shorter than my house key and the same length as my mailbox key) and seems very sturdy.  I do still back up to dropbox (I'm paranoid about losing things) because I worry that dust or moisture will get into this as it has no cover.  However, so far, no problems.  And the lack of cover/moving parts, makes it hold up better in general.  I keep my keys on a metal cable key chain with a screw closure, so getting the drive off my keys is relatively easy.  Previously I kept a PNY flash drive on my keys that had a retractable clip.  But the clip always came undone and then my flash drive was skittering across the parking lot and I had to find it.  I would imagine this would be a little less convenient if you used a typical split ring key ring, but still, it is secure, and looks great.
4	1376524800	I like the size of this drive. I carry it on my key ring and it is smaller and lighter than a key. I don't even notice that it is there. It does come with some installed software for registration. However it would not let me register with,y email address I use for this purpose.
5	1376524800	I used to have a small Kingston USB drive, but the plastic shell soon cracked. I could get a metal onefrom Kingston, but this one is larger than that which is easier for insertion.Drive comes with no partition. Using GParted to create one and boot up linux from it fine.
2	1376438400	The drive has a nicely styled look. I bought it to replace a smaller unit for mp3s for my car. It was difficult to insert it into the front usb port of my computer, it took a very strong push. It was hard to tell if if was inserted and full seated. Some mechanical dimension must be out of spec. There was no handling/physical damage as I had just opened the package. It fit into my usb hub with a bit less effort,but still not easily. This is the first USB device I ever had any insertion issues with. I'm copying music now and I will try it in some other ports to see if it breaks in. Disappointed after all the very positive reviews.
5	1376438400	The flash drive is lightweight and has a high speed for copying files. It's small and fits on my key ring. Just what I need for everyday use.
5	1376352000	this product was reasonably priced easy to work with was able to free my pc of a lot of unnecessary items I love it
5	1376265600	I recently wanted to transfer files from my older computer to a newer one and needed a flash drive to carry with me.  I searched for do many drives and nothing really screamed long lasting and portable.  I then saw this product and the reviews it had and decided to buy one.  I couldn't be any happier!  It's tiny,  looks nice and very sturdy. I transferred 32gb of memory to the one i got and it took less than fifty minutes.  It's a 2.0 drive, so the rate is reasonable.  If you aren't looking for singsong as fast as a 3.0 drive and are looking for something within this category i highly recommend this product.  The same company also carries another product that has password protection of you want to use it for sensitive files.  As for me i just downloaded truecrypt right on the drive and created a 4gb password protected partition that i use for my sensitive files.Cheers.
5	1376092800	it has an awesome keychain hook.it works great.pretty tight the first time you pop it in ..but otherwise its awesome and small
5	1376006400	This product is great and seems real solid. I had to format it NTFS to get files larger than 2GB on it, but that was easy.  It was also smaller than I thought it would be.
5	1375920000	This thing is sturdy, well made and feels like just another key on your key chain.  Great buy, I highly recommend.
5	1375747200	First of all this USB has a great sleek look. It appears tough but I have only had it for a week so time will tell.Now about the BUT; I have a 2012 MacBook Pro and the design has the 2 USB ports very close together, because the USB key ring increases in size it doesn't allow 2 USB plugs at the same time. Although I put this design flaw on apple that is why it gets 5 stars.
4	1375660800	I love the Silicon Power Firma ZN 32GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive, Silver Gray. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. It fits on my key holder nicely so carrying it about is a breeze! I have only used it for a couple of weeks so I cannot vouch for it's durability yet. I hope it can last me a few years.
5	1375574400	really nice design, fast read&write speed. may become warm since it's all metal but overall a great product! strongly recommended.
5	1375574400	I have had thumb drives on my keychain for several years now. Nothing like having your data with you everywhere you go. The Silicon ZN 32gb is an excellent upgrade from my old 16gb. They sit in my keys and haven't had any problems with data loss. The build feels solid.
5	1375574400	The metal casing is slick and nice to hang on my key chain.  The small size makes it easy to carry it around.
5	1375315200	Put this on your key ring and forget it is there. Its a good size(physical) and strong. had it 4-5 months now. I love it and would get more if I needed them.
5	1375228800	64 bits is the largest capacity in a zip drive at this time and the price was excellent.You have to take advantage of this product if your a college student.
5	1375056000	Its a nice product, light, good capacity.Price is OKThis particular model can be used as a Key Chain, very practical!
5	1374969600	very  nice flash drive, good desing! very portable and it has a very big capacity. I recomended it very much!
5	1374969600	I bought this style of Flash Drive because it was one solid piece. It is very well made and durable. If I need another Flash Drive it will be one like this!
5	1374883200	I can put it on my key ring, after using for a while, I think it is very durable, the transmission is fast, I love it.
5	1374710400	I really like the way this flash drive is constructed.  I can put in on my key ring and not worry about losing it.  It's not the fastest flash drive out there, but I have more time than I have money.
5	1374624000	I wanted a high-capacity, small footprint flash drive that I would fit on my key ring.  This drive is small, sturdy (metal casing), carries easily and fits snugly into USB ports (not loose and wiggly like the LaCie iamakey).  Also, with 64GB I wont need another flash drive......for a while.The drive read/write speeds are a little on the slow side but reasonable for USB2.  One problem I found (which is a Windows limitation, not the drive itself) was the default format is exFAT.  This is not universal so other devised could not read the flash drive.  I found a little free program called GUIFormat from [...] which solved that problem.  After reformatting (FAT32) my big "little" flash drive can be used on a wide variety of devices including my computers, USB port in the car, smart TV, Roku and Vizio Co-Star.  And, since it is on my key ring, I always have it with me.  I couldn't be happier.
4	1374451200	Although I have concededly used this flash drive only a few times thus far, it seems to function just fine.  I would recommend it at this point with the caveat that it is still new.
4	1374364800	Hubby told me to buy this for him and sent the link. He says it was $15 but then turned out to be $18 so told me to give it 4-stars. He only used it once then put it away so it did the job it was supposed to.
5	1374278400	How does one review a flash drive? It works, it's a good price, it's light-weight. GREAT. I would definitely recommend this product, as a student, it has gotten plenty of use and I've had no issues.
5	1374192000	I have been using this product since like 3 months and I have no complaints. The best design that can fit into your keychains very comfortably .... Completely recommended .. !!
5	1374105600	I was looking for a large memory stick to fit on my key chain.  I've tried several others and they were quite flimsy.  This one goes on and doesn't get in the way of my keys.
5	1374019200	I love these. They are fast very small, extremely rugged and take up virtually no space on my key ring.It's actually very easy to carry three or four on my key ring without them getting in the way.They are a great find.
5	1374019200	it is very handy and not easy to loose since you can fit it on your key chain it is well worth what i paid
5	1373932800	Really liked the compactness and slickness of design. Looked great on key chain without unsightly bulk. Did not stand out from keys.
5	1373932800	love the flashdisk size and design, the price suitable for a such data size.If you want a portable data devise this will fit your need
4	1373846400	Not as sturdy as the Kingston DataTraveler. Still beats the heck out of plastic, but be prepared to pry the connector aperture open before use.
5	1373673600	This flash drive is so sleek and slim and works like a charm!  Flash drives of this capacity were double the price at Staples I love that it has a loop so you can hook it on a key chain.  I never realized just how much memory 64GB is until I started downloading all my music on it.  I have thousands of songs on it and I still have more than 3/4 available space! Love it!
5	1373500800	I was initially a little disappointed that the drive was not secure or had any PW protection software. I cured it with a purchase of kakasoft USB Secure and I am now very happy. I dont need military grade encryption, just a pasword protected drive to keep out unnecessary eyes.  Will buy again.
5	1373241600	Uber Cool. 64 Gb of Awesomeness right on your Key Ring1. Great Transfer Speeds2. Super Light weight3. Water-proof & sturdy4. n Key-ring Compatible.5. Works Comfortably on MAC or PC*** Buy this if you planning to upgrade your flash drive from 8 / 16 / 32 Gb
4	1373241600	I ordered this flash drive about three months ago, because I knew I was going to need it for school in the fall. When reading the other reviews, I was a little nervous, but decided to try it. I really like it! The hole at the top is perfect for keeping it on my key chain, and I'm really hard on all of my keys, but it still works just fine. A lot of the time, a flash drive will just randomly stop holding memory, and I'm not sure why, but this one is still working just fine! It's a little pricey, but it's a good product.
5	1373241600	Nice USB stick.  Been using for about a month now, fast transfer and compact.  If you are looking for a keychain USB stick then this is the one!
5	1373068800	I recently bought a new vehicle - one in which (for the first time, for me) had an audio system capable of playing music stored on a USB thumb drive. I bought my Silicon Power Firma ZN 64GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive based partly on price and partly on it's simple physical design. Otherwise, it's hard to say why I picked it out of the wide array of other, similar, hight-capacity USB sticks. I suppose, also, that the one negative review of my second-choice as being sluggishly slow to transfer data was another. But, when the product arrived I was totally delighted at it's tiny, tiny, tiny size (an aspect that none of the pictures of on Amazon do justice to). This thing is very small . . . and works perfectly well for what I wanted it for. I stick it in the slot in the dashboard and not much more than the ring shows - yet it holds nearly 640 CDs/albums. That's right, not just 640 tracks . . . 640 whole albums. That is a significant chunk of my entire iTunes collection from my computer. If I buy maybe two or three more I think I will have my entire MP3 library completely contained in the glovebox of my car. I really like the simple, small, and unobtrusive design of this product. The big ring makes it easy to handle and pull in and out of the socket, but isn't an obnoxious distraction sticking out of the dashboard. I was very much unprepared for how small it was, but was delighted when it arrived. I will definitely buy more and recommend them highly.
5	1372896000	This small drive is so handy and fits on a keychain or lanyard for easy transport.  We use it at the office for holding installation files for programs.
5	1372809600	Perfect device to add to you assets.  32gb device in a small package at a great price.Definitely recommend product and 32gb device.
5	1372723200	IT works grate and it keeps all your info safe. you can put it on a key ring and tack it whit you it small and waterproof
4	1372636800	I got this 32G to plug into my wireless router and load up with 6000 songs for a whole house wireless audio. For this purpose it is perfect, since I will plug it in once and forget it. It does not run hot.However, if you are going to use this as your daily backup, connecting and disconnecting all the time, it might not fit the bill. It was very tight trying to connect due to the way it is constructed. I wouldn't feel comfortable using it that way as it seems it might damage the connection.
5	1372636800	It fits perfect onto my key-chain and has tons of memory space.It is well built (not plastic). I would recommend this to a friend,
5	1372636800	Small, sturdy, rational, fast, cheap and even very reliable so far.Design is great too.Can you ask for more?
5	1372464000	It's sturdy and fits well on my key chain.  It's been really dependable so far, and I'm happy with the purchase.
5	1372377600	It's small, sturdy, & I know that it's not going to fall off my keychain. It's exactly what I was looking for!
5	1372377600	Bought this drive specifically to put on my keychain with about 10 keys.  This thing is constantly getting beat up, rattled around in my pocket, etc., and it doesn't have so much as a single scratch on it.  Performance is great.too!Love it!
5	1372377600	The flash drive is great. It is small that you can hang it on your keychain and not notice the weight. I like to have one just in case I need it. Definitely will buy it again.
5	1372291200	So I got this thing and it clocked in at 9 MB/S write. I haven't checked read. Which is actually as fast as my previous &#34;SUPER FAST&#34; USB 2.0 that was expensive. Granted I'm running this off of a 7 year old laptop so your speeds might be faster. So I'm happy with the speeds. Just for reference, I used my old cheap 8GB USB 2.0 and it was going at 2 MB/S write. So a happy cheap upgrade
5	1372032000	Purchased this for my daughter.  It seems robust and a great value.  Reformatted it to NTFS and put several 7GB + files on it.  I would be interested in seeing some actual performance figures for writes on a quick machine (write caching off).  My machine is fairly slow.  It is fast enough for what I use it for - mounting ISO images and streaming video.
3	1372032000	This flash drive works as it should with no issues.It does get really hot when in use.My wife and I have both noticed this on multiple computers each.
5	1372032000	I'm quite happy with this flash drive. It is both elegant and functional. The fit is appropriately snug in the computer, and the ring is sturdy. I was happy to see that the ring was not simply shaped sheet metal and that it was made from one solid piece.
5	1371945600	great item it small and has a great feel to it. very efficient and can use it on my key ring
5	1371859200	Well its been day three and so far I am liking what I see. Transfer rate is better then my previous thumb drive. Although it does have this funny hole in it just inside the loop to its inner chamber. Tried it as a whistle, didn't work.
5	1371772800	great keychain USB, and doesn't have to worry about it breaking off and get lose.  the metal loop make sure it stays with your keys.  it does have a tight fit when using with some USB ports, but it also make sure that the USB stays attached even with all the weight of the keys attached.Overall, I like it, just hope it doesn't break too soon.
5	1371686400	32G of memory on my keychain.  I had so many USB keychain dongles before and most of them get lost from inferior plastic hooks.  This has the hook integrated with the USB dongle itself. This is an excellent combination of aesthetics and functionality.  It looks like a fancy USB dongle made by Lacie.  Easy to push in and easy to pull out.  Speed is the same as my other dongles.Cons:No cover to protect the contacts from getting wet
5	1371686400	Use this drive as a multi-boot utility which I keep attached to my key-chain. Worked perfectly with Xboot to create the ultimate portable IT tool. I've had it for several months now and it still works great.
5	1371513600	Absolutely love this Flash Drive! Small, fast, and fits on my key chain! Have multiple people purchase the exact same one after seeing mine!
4	1371513600	This drive has acted up a few times on me. It has crashed a few times on my Win 7 computer. The drive is still there, but there are no contents (SCARY) unless you remove and reinsert it.
5	1371427200	Fantastic product, price and service! The Silicon Poer Firma fits on my key ring, which makes it so handy and easy to use.
5	1371427200	Very small, solidly built, all metal exterior, fits everywhere.  I have had it for several months, no problems at all.
5	1371254400	Small, sturdy and designed to fit on a keyring. Have been using this drive for 2 months. Meets all expectations. Highly recommended.
2	1371168000	I ordered two, based on metallic composition, 64GB, and raves about "high speed". . .I would like the 5star reviewer who says he is getting 10MB/s to prove it.I started at 6 and went significantly down from there, averaging about 5/MB per second. . .taking over an hour to transfer 29GB from a 3.0 drive to the 2.0 drive, for safekeeping, as these are films. As far as how good it is, or how long it is going to last, I have no idea. The fact that it does not have a traditional white strip, indicating USB 2.0, but a black one, indicating what? may be something. Maybe it is really a 1.1 compatible device. Who knows. I bought 2 and have not opened the second one, as I am seriously considering returning it, as I do not feel it functions as advertised. I'm giving it 2 stars, hoping it continues to function at that level, which is about what I consider it to be. I am used to things going a lot faster.
3	1371081600	When I begin to transfer a larger file to the flash drive the first 125MB are transferred fast at about 15MB/s, but then everything changes and it slows down to a crawl. If I were to guess, the real write speed may be about 5MB/s
5	1370995200	I was looking for a flash drive that I could have on me at all times and I found this one that is smaller than the keys on my keychain and it fits right in. It looks cool, it's durable, and it has plenty of space. I highly recommend this flash drive.
5	1370995200	great product.  This seems to be the highest quality flash drive I have owned and I have owned quite a few.  I love the build quality and speed especially.  The design is exceptional as it allows easy attachment to whatever I want to clip it onto.  Good job guys.
4	1370736000	I bought this flash drive for it's form and capacity. Maybe all USB 2.0 is this slow but it seems to chug more than any other USB device I use. For my purposes it doesn't really make sense to have such a giant capacity (transferring large video files and image sequences to and from work), but if you wanted to use it as a back up drive or music storage it could be great for that.
4	1370390400	Much smaller then I expected. Not a bad thing, just small for my big hands. Works great, though. Good value.
5	1370131200	Minimalist in design, this usb stick is perfect for putting on your keys. It doesnt take up much extra room in the pocket and the big, metal ring will never break off. Other Flash Drives always break off, but this one will surely not. The end plugs right in. No sleeve or anything to break
5	1370044800	I was choosing between this product and the Kingston one, and this one is great.  It is very solid.  And also, I actually like the fact that the &#34;hoop&#34; is a little &#34;big&#34; - trust me, it sits on the keychain great this way.
5	1370044800	These thumb drives are getting smaller and smaller while their storage capacity keeps growing.  A year ago I bought a 32GB thumb drive that was 2&#34; L X 1&#34;W X 1/2&#34; H, before that was a 16GB that was a 3&#34; long cylinder X 1&#34; diameter, both of which I carried on my keyring and thought those were compact. I WAS WRONG. This 64GB thumb drive is actually the size of a petite woman's thumb. It is about 1 3/4&#34; L X 1/2&#34;W X 3/16&#34;H and is perfectly unobtrusive on my keyring.  The aluminum body is very sturdy and the integrated loop makes it easy to put on a keyring or chain. And now I will not run out of space while performing my IT duties at work and at home.  I highly recommend this for someone that is looking for an affordable portable storage solution that is compact.
5	1369958400	WOW! This little flash drive is AWESOME! I can't praise it enough. It's superbly built of a seemingly high quality metal alloy. It has a very elegant and simple design which is quite eye-catching. It goes perfectly on a keychain as a small, portable, and non-invasive flash drive. Performance wise - I haven' done any benchmark tests so I can't make an informed judgement in that regard - but it seems to function properly and efficiently. Overall, i'm highly satisfied with this purchase and will certainly consider other Silicon Power products.
5	1369958400	It's small but has huge storage capacity.  I carry mine on my key ring.  It makes moving documents or pictures from one device to another very easy.
5	1369872000	I like this flash drive very much. My laptop read it very easily, and i was able to copy movies and music on it to play in my Sony Home Theater. This construction of this drive is metallic and can be use on a key ring. I would recommend this drive to any one.
5	1369785600	Great jump drive that should last. Metal case great to stand up to heavy use and situations where plastic won't do
5	1369440000	they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan ,without problems,working perfect,recived as described,its small,fits everywhere,simple perfect,thx guys supporting us,keep it going
4	1369180800	The only issue I have with it and it is  no fault of the product is it is really small, and I worry I may lose it.
5	1369180800	This thing lives on my keychain, and has done so for several months now. It works like a charm, and there's no way in hell that I am going to lose it unless I lose the rest of my keys. My last keychain thumbdrive fell off and I didn't notice for hours and hours, and was never able to recover it and I will never know quite what data was on the drive (as an upside to that experience, I now use KeePass to store all my passwords, and my accounts have never been more secure. I don't THINK I was dumb enough to store my password cheatsheet on the drive, but who knows for sure?).I saw a review of this drive that almost made me choose something else, where the reviewer said that the body of this drive was actually plastic and not metal. I'm glad I took the chance, as the body is most definitely metal. If you're unsure, just take a kitchen magnet and stick it next to the drive. It isn't pure steel so it won't stick like it would stick to a fridge, but it does attract itself to the drive. Also, there's no way plastic can be both this thin and this strong. It's metal, end of story.I saw that this also comes in 64GB, but decided to get the 32 instead. 32 is plenty of space for a keychain drive, and besides - there's no WAY that I would want to sit and wait for 64GB of data to transfer over a USB 2.0 connection. Ick. Also, at 1/3 the price it just made more sense all around.Get it, you will love it!
5	1369008000	I've bought/used at least two dozen USB flash drives over the last 12 years. This particular model by Silicon Power is the best I've ever seen (thus far). I bought two of these [64GB, silver gray, zinc alloy, capless] drives to use for rotating backups and absolutely love them. They are small, stylish, capacious, offer good performance and are reasonably priced (in line with other USB drives having the same capacity)... what more can you ask for?Wish I could trade/swap all of my other (8GB, 16GB and 32GB) USB drives for more of these (16GB and 32GB) SP models. The metal case is attractive and has nothing that can break. As mentioned by others, when you plug it in, the fit is extremely snug/tight.
4	1368921600	Brought this for use with my surface pro and was not disappointed.  Fast read and write times. Compact and slim.  Good product.  Good price.
5	1368489600	1/3 the size and weight of competitors 64GB flash drives! This thing is amazingly small. The upload and download times are respectable. If you need a rock solid storage solution this is the way to go. All metal shell is tough.
5	1368316800	My partner and I keep a flash key on our key rings. Not only is this one stylish, but it seems to be better made than others.
5	1368316800	Works great and sturdy for every day use. I would definitely recommend thus to any one... especially for that affordable price.
5	1368230400	I really like this USB flash drive. It fits well on my key chain, is small, and looks cool. I have had no problems with this product thus far.
3	1368230400	It's a USB Thumb-Drive...what more is there to say? It works as it should, though it does get extremely hot in my MBP's USB slot. I do like that it fits well on my keyring, which makes it very convenient.If you need a USB drive to keep handy, I could recommend this one.
5	1368144000	I am always looking for a balance of does a memory stick work in every pc I need it to, does it work in my USB car stereo port (not all do), is the throughput good when copying files, and how does this drive look and feel when I am using it or lending it to others to get them my files. And so far I have had all positive experience with this Silicon Flash Drive plus the drive feels and looks very slick. I am impressed to date, and I put a lot of weight when I purchase a new product on the reviews of others, and the reviews of others were almost all positive. I would recommend this brand to others as well.
5	1368057600	sometimes you don't want to give a long review for  simple description - it works just like it's supposed to.  It's handy and speeds are well within the range you would expect from USB 2.0.  I use it quite a bit and it works great.
5	1368057600	So easy to carry around. Very slim and convenient. Others are bulky and just get in the way. I hardly feel this on my key chain.
5	1367971200	I love this flash drive. It is great for what I payed ($20). I keep it on my keychain. Its only downfall is slow write speeds, but it is USB 2.0
4	1367798400	...I'm not entirely sure if it's a matter of the tech or not, but it's kind of difficult to plug in and unplug from the computer. It fits a bit tightly into the USB slots. But, really cool and sleek design! And it's very fast for data transfer -- I haven't timed it or anything but USB 3.0 speed is a leap from 2.0. Too bad the USB slots on my computer aren't 3.0 themselves... :)
5	1367798400	I paid a little extra for this than other similar items and I can say I am all the happier. It is sturdy and easy to transport on my key chain.  Nobody seems to notice what it is when it is on my key chain until I use it...
5	1367798400	Besides that its small and it fits in my key chain its a pretty durable little flash drive and I keep everything in it on the go.  For the price I paid for this I loved it and not only that it has 32GB which is plenty enough for me.  I Love It.
4	1367452800	small, resistant and compact. This is all i need. The good point is that you can attach it to your key holder
5	1367280000	One-piece metal construction. Not sure how they make it - no seams anywhere. Good price for what you are getting, whereas you'd most likely get some plastic ones if you were to pay the same somewhere else. Goes effortlessly on my keychain. Good Design!
5	1367280000	64 gig capacity holds everything I need in one handy spot; in my key case. I bought two so I have a backup handy, it took forever to transfer files onto this thing, it's immense capacity made copying all the files time consuming. 64 gigabytes is a lot of files.
5	1367193600	I have two of these flash drives. The 16gb is on my key chain so I can always save and transport files with me no matter where I am. The 32gb flash drive is at home for more serious projects. Very impressed by the small size, sleek design and the memory capabilities. It's not made of steel, however, and it is an electronic so you need to treat it with care and it will work perfect for you.
4	1367107200	This little device seems to run fine.  I've had it now for about a week with no problems.  BUT, as my title says, it runs really hot.  I'm not sure if this is supposed to be like this or not.  I've had USB devices get warm before, but with the metal casing, it gets to the point where it almost hurts my hand when holding it after it's been plugged in for awhile.  Maybe I'm just a wimp, but this does worry me.  I'm keeping backups just to make sure and will give it a chance for now.
5	1367020800	Love this Flash drive. Built well and been on my keychain since I got it about a month ago. No issues and love having all the space at my fingertips!
5	1366761600	Looks great, feels solid, great for the price.  Kinda slow but again, you can't ask for more for the price.
4	1366502400	It compact and fit into any containment I place it in. I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to purchase this based on my preference.
5	1366070400	I absolutely love this USB, it is not too tiny but I definitely need to attach it to a keychain or something bigger so I'm always aware of where I put it. The price for the 64 GB model is incredibly cheap but the quality of the material is super nice.
4	1365724800	it is only 29 and i have wiped everything on it, a little deceiving i think but hey whatever.As for the product itself it looks amazing and is small like i had hoped. feels nice and sturdy and wont mind getting bumped around with your keys and fits securely on a key ring (my last flash drive broke off the chain so thats why i chose this one and it does the job!).  Definitely worth buying especially if you don't mind a few missing gigs. if it wasn't for that it would be a 5 star item easily.
5	1365638400	I think that this is a great product, I use it everyday. Small, sturdy, and high capacity. I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
4	1365552000	I bought this in conjunction with the MantaRing - Cable Key Ring. I needed a durable flash drive to carry all the time. I have broken plastic ones off of my king ring so this was perfect. I did not expect it to be fast and its not but then again I&#8217;m not transferring 32 GB of data all the time. Some reviews indicated theirs was plastic. Mine seems to be a non-ferrous metal. Over all for the price it is a good buy. Durable and eye pleasing and wont snap off of your king ring.
5	1365465600	Excellent compact design, high capacity, reasonably fast data xfer, compact with no moving parts to fiddle with or break. And the sturdy metal loop/handle comes in handy when trying to extract the drive from a USB port since it's a very tight fit in the 3 USB ports I've tried it in. While you certainly don't want a too-loose fit, it seems they could get the plug-size tolerance a bit better, so it plugs in easier..snug, but not too tight.Got mine for $15 (incl ship), so can't beat that for a solid little 32 gig drive.Wish I had ordered a couple of extras since noticing the price is back over $20.
1	1365120000	This product is cheap and the casing collapses due to keys pressing against it.  The whole purpose in buying this USB is to have a durable thumb drive on your keychain.  My keychain has 4 keys, 3 of which are rubber coated, so I have no idea why this thing has performed so poorly.  Initially I didn't mind having to lift the indented casing with a screwdriver periodically, but this last time I plugged it into my computer it failed to launch and when I removed it I noticed it was hot; thus I have lost many important files.  I can only assume its failure is related to the cheap casing, so based on this I recommend not using this if you keep your keys in your pocket.
5	1365033600	it goes on chain / key ring / wallet cool metal looking ( almost like a an ANKH)it gets hot during ops.fassssssst clocked at near 40 megs per second benchmark (probably why it gets so HOT)
5	1364947200	Bought one for me and one for my girlfriend.  Works great with the (2) detachable key-rings I bought in an Auto-Store.  Just &#34;quick-release&#34; and detach from our keychain(s) to insert in computer ... or car stereo.Great Deal and Highly Recommend!
5	1364860800	Awesome so far. and really small and sturdy. Also this thing looks great and is not intrusive or anything. Recommend!
5	1364774400	I read up on many flash drives at the 32-64gb levels. I found the 128gb ones did not seem to please enough discerning customers at Amazon. I opted for a smaller USB 64gb 2.0 one, yet the largest (to date) made by Silicon Power Firma at 64gb, for three reasons. If you want a metal one, ensure you check the Silver Gray option.1) Sturdiness. It is tough metal and not plastic, so there's less to chip off or wear away. Obviously, the ring attaches to a keychain or lanyard.2) Design. No cap to lose or slide to wear off the wrong way. Although I hate not having this covered up, it's recessed enough (one hopes) for the protection desired.3) Price. This meets my needs and is competitive with other brands.I plugged it in. It fits very firmly, with less wiggle room than a conventional design. Insert and remove it carefully. P.S. While my laptop would not (IE platform installed by my workplace) recognize the set-up, I simply opened up the drive as one would any USB device. I dragged files in and they transferred easily. This is a small size, a bit less in thickness and length than the USB type with a cap, so I recommend anchoring it to a keychain and keeping it off the other keys and metallic items to minimize scuffing or bending, but I'll reckon it's made to last.
4	1364688000	I bought this USB when my computer stopped working and I needed something to back up my files.  So I bought this because it has loads of space and seemed durable.  It works great and the tech I took my computer to said its the toughest USB he's seen.  I keep it on my key chain, which is easy because it's small and light.  The ONLY drawback is that it doesn't come with a lid.  I worry about dust collecting or even liquid or other random things getting into it.  I might just find a lid from another USB and switch it out.  Either way, I've had a few USBs and this one is the best.
4	1364601600	Love the design part...its so functional. just attach it to key chain and see people look at it in a eager manner. 32GB...awesome for the miniature size. Gets little heated but I guess all these flash memory technologies do.
5	1364428800	the drive is tinier than I thought which makes it even better than I was hoping for.  worked right out of the packaging
4	1364256000	I would order another but with more GBs...I am satisfied with my order and have no complaints. I ordered it and was surprised I received it as quickly as I did.
5	1364256000	great product and great price.  I use it on my key chain.  I have had it for at least a month now and It still works great.
5	1364169600	This is a fast and efficient little 32gb Flash drive that is an excellent value.  What i really like is that fits perfectly on a key chain so I can carry it along with my keys. It is not the smallest flash drive or the fastest but I don't need it to be.  It does exactly what I bought it for, having portable data storage that I wont lose.  If you want something smaller buy something smaller.  If you need a fast transfer drive buy one that has 3.0 compatibility. If you want a good economical flash drive that has a lot of storage and fits perfectly on a key chain buy this flash drive.
5	1364169600	I ordered the 64 gig version of the Silicon Power Firma ZN flash drive and the similar, but smaller Kingston Data Traveller USB drive. The Silicon Power flash drive is very nice. It fits on my keychain very nicely with a key hole that is perfectly sized to allow wiggle room when using the flash drive with keys still attached. The Kingston flash drive is much smaller, but that makes it hard to handle and it doesn't have any room for your key chain loop to wiggle when you use it still connected. The Silicon Power drive is fast, works great on my Mac and PC as I have it formatted with the factory FAT filesystem. It has held up well for the last three months on my keychain and shows virtually no signs of rubbing against my other keys. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that the photos make it look like it is curved. It is absolutely flat and actually tapers where the loop is, which makes it fit on a keychain even better. I do find it AMAZING that I am able to carry around 64 gigs of storage on my keychain. Years ago that was a whole stack of hard drives.. many years ago it was unfathomable to have that much space, much less own it for $40. We are the Jetsons! What will my kids have access to???
5	1364083200	I purchased this for my Xbox 360. I didn't want to purchase a larger hard drive, so I purchased this instead. It looks great plugged into the xbox's usb port. It's small and the perfect size. Works fast when loading games.
5	1364083200	Simple little usb drive.  slim, doesn't make my keys that much more bulky.  uploading and downloads relatively quickly.  waterproof too, i've dropped it in snow and still works fine.
5	1363737600	Have this attached to my key chain.  Would always lose the loose USB's.  Not super fast, but not to be expected for 2.0.  Metal casing that has stood up to being stuffed in my pocket with other keys.
5	1363564800	How is it that not many years ago a 4Gig hard drive was expensive and massive, and now I can carry around 64GB of data on something smaller than a house key? This thing is incredible.
4	1363392000	works as intended, this is how all product of this type should be built.  Could be better priced the $12 price point would be great.
5	1363219200	These are awesome little thumb drives. I had a 32g drive fail on me a few weeks ago, so I ordered these. Very well made. I don't know about weather proof and all that. But, they are really nice.
4	1362873600	a little slow. holds plenty s***. expensive I think. doesn't dance or play tunes or blink while u wait for a machine to copy. gets a little extra hot too
2	1362873600	I bought this USB stick after reading positive reviews, especially ones highlighting speed. Well, in my experience this drive is dismally slow. I uploaded a screenshot where you can see it in action. It averages 5.5 MB/s write on a big ISO file. Way below USB 2 max transfer rate. It also gets too warm during operation.Pros: It looks very nice, it's small, fits perfectly on a key ring, and is spacious.Cons: It's very slow. Expect to wait a long time copying large files.Bottom line: Drive this large is expected to move around big files; it doesn't help if it takes forever to copy them to the stick.
5	1362700800	This drive is probably one of the easiest and most bang for your buck that I could find.Plugged it in and it was detected immediately. Not bad usable space - about 30 GB.Option to register for lifetime via a folder in the directory and it took less than 30 seconds.Very solid construction with metallic design and very portable - I can take it everywhere on my keys.Started copying from the getgo and I am getting at least 10 MB/s always.Great drive for the price and you don't lose quality OR performance.
5	1362528000	Looks great!  It's a solid zinc all around.  It's not curved (the picture makes it seem like it is).  I was initially going to get the slightly cheaper Kingston ones that look similar, but I like that this one has a larger ring.
5	1362441600	Shipped rapidely. 32 GB of memory in such a small flashdrive is great. Can bring anywhere and attach it to keychain. Very light, make it easier if you need to ship it by mail to somebody.
5	1362268800	I highly recommend a metal casing if you're going to have your key chain hanging off of a flash drive. This won't break any time soon.  Other than that it's a flash drive. And a flash drive's a flash drive.
5	1362182400	This is very good product and the price is awesome. It works very well and is very portable. Worth every penny.
1	1362182400	I was really sad because this arrived damaged. It is very cute and tiny and would be perfect for my keychain.  I worry that if it arrived damaged that even if I were to get a new one it would become damaged by keeping it on my keychain.  I am in the process of returning it now and don't know if I will buy another one.
5	1362096000	This tiny flash drive can hang from your keys or from a chain around your next where it can pass for a modernistic pendant. It does what is supposed to do, looks nice and is well worth its price.
5	1361750400	I have no complaints about this USB Flash Drive.  I use it daily and haven't had any problems with it.  It feels like its very solid and tough.  It also is quite smaller than the picture portrays.  I highly recommend it.
5	1361664000	Have two of these on my keychain, don't add any excessive bulk, and always handy.  The enclosure is metal and shows no sign of wearing after months of daily carry.
5	1361577600	Strong,sleek plenty of data.Planing to buy few more.It look nice on key chain or neck lace perhaps.My estimate is that will last for years.I hope the software lasts too..
4	1361491200	Not bad it is a bit slow but for the money you cant beat it. Heavy duty construction is always a plus.
5	1361491200	One reviewer said the body was made of plastic but it is definitely a metal of some sort. It is very durable and small and is very fast
5	1360800000	I rarely can keep a flash drive on my keychain for long. After being disappointed with theLaCie PetiteKey 32GB USB Flash Drive (9000348)build quality I started using theKingston Digital DataTraveler SE9 16GB USB 2.0 DTSE9H/16GBZdespite only being able to get it in 16GB. The kingston was great but I still needed something with more storage and found this Silicon Power drive that is very similar in design but holds twice as much. The price was also perfect. I'm sure I'll be buying more of these until someone comes out with a usb 3.0 model with the same form factor.

5	1360713600	has the memory to save any game we have, and multiple games as well.  Very sleek and easily fits on necklace for storage .
5	1360368000	This is great, so far. Using on key ring to carry most things I might need and can handle a ton of my music and pics. Size is good and it feels sturdy. We will see
5	1360281600	It's metal.  It feels sturdy.  It fits perfectly on my keyring.  I've used it to transfer a few large files.  I saw about 6MB/sec write speed and about 20MB/sec read, which, from what I have read, isn't bad for a USB 2.0 flash drive.  I haven't felt the drive get hot yet, but I will update my review if it does.  I like it.  I would buy it again.
2	1360195200	I love the look, size and build quality of this drive, but it is way to SLOW to consider using. If I could I would not have purchased it. I'm averaging about 5minutes per 1gb. I bought a 64GB drive so I could move large work files daily as needed. This is very inconvenient if you need something quickly. I purchased another flashdrive years ago that was much faster. If you're moving very small files and/or have a lot of time to spare when transferring then I would consider it for it's form.
5	1360195200	I would recommend this for anyone ,small and not bulky like most flash drives.Only thing i dislike about it is that it gets hot while in use.
4	1359504000	Love the fact that it's got a ton of storage space and I really like the way it's designed with the the keyring loop integrated into the body of the device.  Also was surprised to see on the package that it's supposedly &#34;waterproof&#34;.  Not sure if that's true -- but I have no plans to test it any time soon.  My only gripe is that it is rather slow to transfer files to it.  I guess USB 3.0 is much better.  However, that's really a minor gripe, as I'm using this for my music and movies and it's plenty fast enough to run with my car stereo and DVD players.
5	1359244800	Nice product I use in my key chain and I could store files everywhere I really love it this product
5	1359158400	Like Mighty Mouse, this unit is small, but it's powerful. It is certainly fast enough for anything I have used it for.A great buy.
5	1359072000	Useful and tiny like a mailbox key . the size was surprising - I love the large storage capacity !!
4	1359072000	Its cute and it works...but it gets really hot? So far so good but I wonder how long it will last.
5	1358985600	I bought this product to one of my best friend. I bought it as a gift, he is really happy about it and he is recommending this product. He is very pleased about it.
1	1357862400	This is the first flash drive I've had from Silicon Power and the first flash drive I've had that didn't last even a month. Very pretty, but very disappointing.
5	1357862400	Bought one to make sure it was what we were looking for, then bought 3 more.  Small enough to easily carry on a key chain, the "eye" connects to a key chain security, the unit is tough and won't break or drop off.  No bloatware.  Well made and sturdy.  Exactly what we were looking for.  Have used several key chain drives in the past, and they all had problems that this one solves.
5	1356912000	Ordered the 32G version. Ran a benchmark on it, and it is able to write at 15 MB/sec and read at 30 MB/sec for large files (posted screenshot). Very fast! The picture makes is look as though the stick is slightly curved, which it is not. Also, the picture conveys a higher quality finish than is actually on the unit. But it does have a very slight "heft" that feels like quality. I like the design which I hope will be a long lasting and ever available keychain dongle. Since it is so new I can't speak to its reliability in this use.
