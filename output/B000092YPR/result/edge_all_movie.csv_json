telling me to be quite , well after about 2 weeks of owning them , i had committed one of my rules -lrb- always unplug something when not using it -rrb- i came around the corner and caught the 1/4 '' plug and ripped the cord out of my amp , down passed where it goes from 3.5 to 1/4 '' , for some reason i ca n't get them to work anymore , i tried to replace the plug with a number of them that i had lying around with no luck , so i just decided to just buy another pair , i have had some headphones that ran up to about $ 300.00 that is hard to tell any difference until you crank it up , then you can tell them apart , but most definitely if you need headphones at least try these , unless your into recording or producing , they just wont hold up to that , so i hope that this review might help
